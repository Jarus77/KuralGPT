During the three months ended September\\n30, 2023, we recorded earnings charges of $315 million resulting from a customer agreement. The charge includes estimated customer\\nconsiderations as well as increased costs to enhance the constellation and meet lifecycle commitments.\\nSee further discussion of fixed-price contracts in Note 9 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nBDS loss from operations includes our share of earnings from equity method investments of $34 million and $24 million for the nine and three\\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 compared with equity earnings of $2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and equity loss\\nof $38 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022.\\nBacklog\\nBDS backlog increased from $54,373 million as of December 31, 2022 to $57,802 million at September 30, 2023, primarily due to the timing of\\nawards, partially offset by revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior periods.\\nAdditional Considerations\\nOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Some of these programs\\nhave cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily reduced award or incentive fees, lower\\nprofit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based\\nMidcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\\nSome of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include\\nCommercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B, and commercial and military satellites. A number of our ongoing fixed-price\\ndevelopment programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during\\nthe period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during\\ndevelopment, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our\\nestimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are\\nongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of\\nthese programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended,'),\n",
