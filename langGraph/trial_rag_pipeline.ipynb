      "content=\"Agent memory in artificial intelligence can generally be divided into two categories: short-term (or working) memory and long-term memory. These correspond respectively to an AI's ability to remember information relevant for immediate decision making or actions, while also keeping track of knowledge acquired over time that might influence future behavior. \\n\\nIn a more detailed breakdown, agent memories can include:\\n\\n1. **Belief Memory** – This type stores the belief state about the world which is subjective and may change as new information becomes available or old assumptions are proven incorrect. It represents how an AI perceives its environment at any given moment based on current sensory input, previous experiences and internal reasoning processes.\\n   \\n2. **Goal Memory** – This stores the goals of the agent which guide decision-making behavior towards achieving desired outcomes while avoiding undesirable ones. Goals can change over time as priorities shift or new objectives are set. \\n\\n3. **Action History (or Execution Trace)** – It records every action taken by an AI, including its immediate predecessor and subsequent consequences. This aids in learning from past actions to make better choices in the future.\\n   \\n4. **Learning Memory/Experience Replay Buffer** - In reinforcement learning agents specifically, this stores experiences (state-action pairs along with their resulting reward) which are sampled and replayed during training for improving policy evaluation or value function approximation methods like Q-learning or temporal difference methods.\\n   \\n5. **Planning Memory/Workspace** - This is a temporary holding place where the agent stores information required to execute plans such as intermediate goals, necessary preconditions etc. It assists in sequencing actions and understanding dependencies between them during plan execution but does not store long term memories or knowledge about past events outside of its own lifetime (i.e., it's transient).\\n   \\n6. **Motivational Memory** - In more complex models that incorporate cognitive aspects, motivation-driven memory might be present which influences the agent to selectively attend to certain information or learnings based on their relevance for achieving goals and satisfying basic needs like survival etc.. This is often seen in bio-inspired AI agents.\\n   \\n7. **Emotional Memory** - Some advanced models also consider emotions as part of agent memory which influence not just learning but decision making, interaction with others or environment based on perceived positive/negative experiences (though its formal incorporation into artificial intelligence is still an active research area).\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'model': 'phi3', 'created_at': '2024-10-18T13:55:25.796050078Z', 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ''}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 3113906672, 'load_duration': 9908081, 'prompt_eval_count': 89, 'prompt_eval_duration': 8744000, 'eval_count': 549, 'eval_duration': 2964107000} id='run-b00b89aa-2b5e-44ba-bb6e-b8985a590442-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 89, 'output_tokens': 549, 'total_tokens': 638}\n"

According to the verse, a body filled with love is considered to be truly alive, as it is the love within us that animates our existence and gives life its vibrancy and purpose. The verse suggests that a life without love is akin to a lifeless body, a mere skeletal structure covered with skin, devoid of the emotional vitality that defines living. \\n\\nThe metaphor of a 'bone overlaid with skin' is used to depict a life devoid of love, suggesting such a life lacks depth, warmth, and the essential human connection. The verse implies that love forms the essence of life and without it, we are akin to the walking dead, physically present but emotionally and spiritually vacant. \\n\\nThis verse underscores the importance of love in our lives, not just in terms of romantic love, but also in terms of compassion, empathy, and kindness towards others. It is a call to infuse love into our actions, thoughts, and behaviors, thereby enriching our lives and the lives of those around us. Love, according to this verse, is not just an emotion, but a way of life that defines our very existence.\\ntranslation: The seat of life is love alone;  Or beings are but skin and bone!\"),\n",
