    "content": "The kural verse:அகர முதல எழுத்தெல்லாம் ஆதிபகவன் முதற்றே உலகு. ,translates to :'A' leads letters; the Ancient Lord Leads and lords the entire world,and it's explantion is :The first verse of Thiru Kural begins by drawing a parallel between the primacy of the letter 'A', as the first letter in the Tamil alphabet (and many others), and the Supreme God, who is considered the primal cause and the origin of the universe. \n\nJust as all written language and communication originate from the basic unit of a letter, with 'A' often being the first, all of creation and life as we know it have their roots in the divine entity, referred to here as the 'eternal God'. \n\nThis verse emphasizes the concept that God is the beginning of all existence, the ultimate source of all life, and the cornerstone of the world, just as the letter 'A' is the first building block of language. \n\nIt also subtly underscores the importance of recognizing and acknowledging the divine force as central to our understanding of life and the world around us. The verse, thus, sets a spiritual tone at the outset, highlighting the universal and timeless nature of the wisdom contained in the Thiru Kural..The kural verse:கற்றதனால் ஆய பயனென்கொல் வாலறிவன்நற்றாள் தொழாஅர் எனின். ,translates to :That lore is vain which does not fall  At His good feet who knoweth all,and it's explantion is :Kural 2 emphasizes the importance of humility and respect for those who possess greater knowledge. The verse questions the value of education if it does not lead to reverence for those who are endowed with superior wisdom. \n\nIn essence, it underlines that learning should not only be about acquiring information or skills but also about developing a sense of humility and respect for those who are more knowledgeable. It suggests that without this acknowledgement and reverence, the benefits of learning are diminished or even nullified.\n\nThis teaching can be interpreted on a spiritual level, where the 'possessor of pure knowledge' could refer to God or a divine entity, suggesting the importance of devotion and humility in spiritual growth. On a societal level, it encourages respect and acknowledgment for teachers, scholars, and elders who have more experience and knowledge. \n\nSo, the core message of Kural 2 is that true learning should instill humility, respect, and reverence for those who hold greater wisdom and knowledge. Without this, the value of the acquired knowledge is questionable..The kural verse:மலர்மிசை ஏகினான் மாணடி சேர்ந்தார்நிலமிசை நீடுவாழ் வார். ,translates to :Long they live on earth who gain The feet of God in florid brain,and it's explantion is :Kural 3 can be interpreted as a spiritual verse that emphasizes the significance of devotion and surrender to the divine. The verse metaphorically refers to the divine or God as someone who \"passes swiftly over the flower of the mind\". This can be understood as God's omnipresence and the ability to pervade and influence our thoughts and consciousness. \n\nThe \"flower\" in this context is symbolic of the human mind or heart, which is expected to blossom with virtues and good thoughts, just like a flower blooming. The idea of God passing over the flower of the mind suggests that divine grace can help purify and elevate our thoughts.\n\nThe second part of the verse says, \"shall flourish long above all worlds\". This suggests the idea of spiritual enlightenment or salvation (Moksha), which is considered the ultimate goal in many Indian philosophies. Those who are devoted to God, who surrender their thoughts and actions to the divine, are said to attain a state of eternal bliss, transcending the materialistic world and its transient pleasures.\n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse advocates for a life rooted in spirituality and devotion. It suggests that a mind filled with divine thoughts leads to lasting peace and contentment, surpassing all worldly pleasures and sufferings. Furthermore, it encourages individuals to seek a higher purpose in life, beyond worldly desires and attachments. The verse resonates with the idea that true and lasting happiness comes from within, from the divine presence in one's heart and mind..The kural verse:வேண்டுதல் வேண்டாமை இலானடி சேர்ந்தார்க்குயாண்டும் இடும்பை இல. ,translates to :Who hold His feet who likes nor loathes Are free from woes of human births,and it's explantion is :Kural 4 emphasizes the importance of devotion to the divine, defined here as the entity devoid of desire or aversion. This verse suggests that those who meditate and dedicate themselves to this entity will be free from hardships and suffering. \n\nThe concept of the divine being free of desire or aversion is aligned with philosophies that view God as a supreme, unchanging entity that is free of worldly attachments and biases. This entity does not favor or disfavor, does not desire or reject anything, thereby embodying a state of perfect equanimity and tranquility.\n\nThe verse encourages individuals to embrace this same state of desireless and unbiased existence. By meditating on the divine, one can strive to embody these characteristics, ultimately freeing themselves from the cycle of pain and suffering that often comes with worldly desires and aversions. \n\nIn essence, the verse is a call to spiritual dedication and inner peace. It suggests that those who are able to relinquish their worldly desires and aversions, and instead, focus their thoughts and actions towards the divine, will be protected from suffering and hardship. This is not just a physical protection, but more importantly, it is a mental and spiritual safeguard, reinforcing the idea that true peace and happiness come from within, rather than from external circumstances..The kural verse:இருள்சேர் இருவினையும் சேரா இறைவன்பொருள்சேர் புகழ்புரிந்தார் மாட்டு. ,translates to :God's praise who tell, are free from right  And wrong, the twins of dreaming night,and it's explantion is :Kural 5 delves into the concept of spiritual enlightenment and its impact on the actions (karma) of individuals. The verse suggests that those who genuinely appreciate and aspire to the glory of God, understanding the true nature of divinity, are not affected by the dualistic actions born out of ignorance.\n\nThe \"two-fold deeds that spring from darkness\" symbolizes actions that are categorized as good or bad, right or wrong, which are the results of worldly ignorance or spiritual darkness. These actions often bind individuals to the cycle of birth and death in the Hindu philosophy.\n\nIn contrast, those who \"delight in the true praise of God\" have attained a level of wisdom and spiritual enlightenment. They see beyond the distinctions of good and bad and understand that everything is a part of God's divine play. Such individuals, according to the verse, are untouched by these dualistic actions.\n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes the importance of spiritual wisdom in liberating oneself from the binding effects of actions and promotes the pursuit of divine knowledge as a means to achieve this state of freedom..The kural verse:பொறிவாயில் ஐந்தவித்தான் பொய்தீர் ஒழுக்கநெறிநின்றார் நீடுவாழ் வார். ,translates to :They prosper long who walk His way Who has the senses signed away,and it's explantion is :Kural 6 emphasizes the importance of self-discipline and moral conduct for achieving long-term prosperity and happiness. It suggests that those who follow the path of righteousness, as exemplified by the divine entity who has successfully controlled the five senses, shall enjoy prolonged prosperity.\n\nThe five senses referred to here are sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell. These senses are often the gateways through which desires and temptations enter human consciousness. When these senses are not regulated, they can lead to immoral actions and disturbances in life. \n\nThe verse praises those who are able to exercise restraint over these senses, aligning with the divine example of control and discipline. It is through this control that they abide in a \"faultless way\". This way is described as a path of truth and righteousness, free of deceit and immorality.\n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse advocates for self-discipline, moral integrity, and righteous living, asserting that these virtues lead to lasting prosperity and a fulfilling life. It underscores the idea that peace and long-term happiness come from inner discipline and control over sensory desires, rather than external materialistic acquisitions..The kural verse:தனக்குவமை இல்லாதான் தாள்சேர்ந்தார்க் கல்லால்மனக்கவலை மாற்றல் அரிது. ,translates to :His feet, whose likeness none can find, Alone can ease the anxious mind,and it's explantion is :This verse speaks to the profound peace and tranquility that comes from deep spiritual devotion. The 'Him who is incomparable' referred to in this verse is a representation of the divine or god, a power that is beyond comparison or equal. The 'feet' symbolize surrender or submission, a well-known concept in spiritual practices, where one submits their ego and worldly concerns to the divine.\n\nThiruvalluvar, the author, states that the anxieties of the mind, which could include worries, fears, doubts, and other negative emotions, can only be truly resolved or removed by those who surrender themselves to the divine. This surrender is not about passivity or resignation, but about active trust and faith. It's about letting go of the need to control and instead placing trust in the divine order of things.\n\nThis verse thus emphasizes the importance of spirituality and the belief in a higher power in overcoming mental distress. It suggests that human efforts alone might be insufficient to completely eradicate mental agony. Instead, it is through the combination of one's efforts with spiritual faith and surrender to the divine power, that one can achieve true peace of mind.\n\nIt should be noted that interpretations could vary based on one's personal beliefs and philosophies. Some might interpret the 'Him who is incomparable' as their personal deity, a spiritual guru, or even a set of philosophical principles that guide their life. The central idea, however, remains the same - that ultimate peace comes from surrender to something greater than ourselves..The kural verse:அறவாழி அந்தணன் தாள்சேர்ந்தார்க் கல்லால்பிறவாழி நீந்தல் அரிது. ,translates to :Who swims the sea of vice is he Who clasps the feet of Virtue's sea,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural emphasizes the importance of virtue and the divine grace in overcoming life's challenges and vices. Here, the 'gracious Being' refers to the divine entity or God, who is depicted as a boundless ocean of righteousness or virtue. \n\nThe 'sea of vice' symbolizes the worldly challenges and negative influences that one may encounter in life. The verse suggests that only those who are connected or attached to the divine feet, implying those who follow the path of righteousness and have the divine grace, can overcome these worldly vices. These vices are likened to a vast sea, not easily crossed by those who lack the spiritual guidance and the strength of virtue.\n\nIn the context of Tamil culture, the divine feet are often seen as a place of refuge and a source of divine grace. By seeking the divine feet, one seeks to adhere to the path of righteousness that leads to liberation from worldly bonds.\n\nThe verse underlines the importance of virtue and divine grace in navigating through life's challenges. Without the anchor of virtue and the divine's guidance, it is difficult to transcend the turbulent sea of worldly vices and sorrows. \n\nIn essence, this verse is a profound reminder of the power of virtue and divine grace in guiding us through life's complexities and challenges, reinforcing the importance of spiritual adherence in overcoming worldly vices..The kural verse:கோளில் பொறியின் குணமிலவே எண்குணத்தான்தாளை வணங்காத் தலை. ,translates to :Like senses stale that head is vain Which bows not to Eight-Virtued Divine,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of reverence and humility towards a higher power, in this case, God, who is portrayed as being possessed of eight attributes. These attributes could refer to various aspects like omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence, divine love, etc. \n\nThe verse likens an individual who does not honor or worship God to a body with senses but without the power to perceive or respond. Just as a body with non-functional senses cannot experience or interact with the world, a person who does not acknowledge a divine force or higher power fails to engage with the spiritual dimension of life.\n\nThe verse also subtly hints at the importance of humility. By using the imagery of 'bowing the head' or 'worshipping the feet', it suggests that acknowledging the superiority of a divine entity and our relative insignificance is key to spiritual growth.\n\nIn a broader interpretation, this verse can also be seen as a call for gratitude and acknowledgment of forces larger than ourselves, be it nature, the universe, or the shared human experience. It suggests that a life lived without this acknowledgment is akin to having senses but being unable to experience or appreciate the world around us..The kural verse:பிறவிப் பெருங்கடல் நீந்துவர் நீந்தார்இறைவன் அடிசேரா தார். ,translates to :The sea of births they alone swim Who clench His feet and cleave to Him,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural signifies the importance of divine surrender and the role it plays in overcoming the struggles of life. The verse metaphorically refers to life as a vast ocean of births (referring to the cycle of life, death, and rebirth in Hindu philosophy) which is difficult to cross. The 'sea of births' symbolizes the trials and tribulations, the sufferings and challenges we face in our lives.\n\n\"None can swim the great sea of births but those who are united to the feet of God\" - This implies that only those who surrender themselves to the divine, who are devoted and have unwavering faith in the Supreme Being can navigate through this vast ocean. Here, being \"united to the feet of God\" refers to the act of total submission and absolute faith in God.\n\nThe verse suggests that life's struggles are an inevitable part of the human experience, comparable to trying to cross a vast, turbulent sea. However, it also offers a solution - that unwavering faith and surrender to the divine can provide the strength and guidance needed to overcome these challenges. This Kural, therefore, emphasizes the power of spirituality and divinity in helping us navigate the difficulties of life.\n\nIn a broader perspective, it underlines the belief in a higher power or divine guidance, which is a universal concept found across many cultures and religions, although interpreted and understood in various ways. It encourages reliance on this higher power to find strength, resilience, and ultimately, liberation from the cycle of birth and rebirth..The kural verse:வான்நின்று உலகம் வழங்கி வருதலால்தான்அமிழ்தம் என்றுணரற் பாற்று. ,translates to :The genial rain ambrosia call: The world but lasts while rain shall fall,and it's explantion is :Kural 11 is a testament to the vital importance of rain for the sustenance of life on Earth. It refers to rain as 'ambrosia', a term often used in ancient texts to denote a heavenly nectar that provides immortality. Here, the term ambrosia symbolizes the life-giving and life-sustaining properties of rain.\n\nThe verse proposes that the world is kept alive and flourishing through the continuous cycle of rainfall. Rain is essential for all forms of life. It nourishes the soil, enabling plants to grow, which in turn provide food and shelter for animals and humans. Further, rainwater fills our rivers, lakes and groundwater reserves, ensuring a constant supply of freshwater, which is a basic necessity for survival.\n\nBy equating rain to ambrosia, the verse emphasizes its indispensability. Just like ambrosia is considered divine and life-giving, rain too is seen as a critical life force that nourishes, sustains and preserves the world. This comparison also reflects the ancient Tamil people's deep respect and reverence for nature and its elements.\n\nIn essence, Kural 11 underscores the profound ecological truth that rain, though often taken for granted, is the very elixir of life, keeping the world vibrant and alive. It is a call to acknowledge and appreciate the life-sustaining power of this natural phenomenon..The kural verse:துப்பார்க்குத் துப்பாய துப்பாக்கித் துப்பார்க்குத்துப்பாய தூஉம் மழை. ,translates to :The rain begets the food we eat,and it's explantion is :Kural 12:\n\nThe rain not only produces foods that satisfy the hunger of people but also stands as a food itself for those who consume it. \n\nThis Kural highlights the importance of rain in sustaining life on earth. Thiruvalluvar, the author, uses the metaphor of rain as food to illustrate its vital role in our survival. The rain, through its nourishment of crops and other food sources, indirectly feeds us. Moreover, when consumed directly as water, it quenches our thirst and provides vital hydration for our bodies, thus serving as a food itself. \n\nThe Kural also implies a deeper philosophical and moral message. The rain does not discriminate or favor any particular region, it showers uniformly on all lands. In the same way, the benefits of good deeds, like rain, should fall on everyone equally. This verse is a metaphor for selfless giving and the virtue of equality. \n\nIn conclusion, this verse is not just about the material importance of rain, but also about the ethical principles of selflessness, generosity, and equal distribution of resources..The kural verse:விண்இன்று பொய்ப்பின் விரிநீர் வியனுலகத்துஉள்நின்று உடற்றும் பசி. ,translates to :Let clouds their visits stay, and dearth Distresses all the sea-girt earth,and it's explantion is :The verse 13 of Thiru Kural talks about the importance of rain for the survival and prosperity of life in the world. It metaphorically uses the image of a cloud withholding rain and causing widespread hunger to emphasize the crucial role that nature and its resources play in our lives.\n\nThe cloud in this Kural is a symbol for rain, which is a fundamental natural resource that nourishes all forms of life. When it withholds its bounty, it causes a ripple effect of distress and suffering. The 'sea-girt spacious world' represents our globe, surrounded by the vast ocean. Despite being covered largely by water, without rain, the world would be gripped by hunger. \n\nThis is because rain is not just about water. It is the primary source of freshwater which is needed for agriculture that provides us food. Without rain, crops fail, leading to famine and widespread hunger. \n\nThis Kural is a subtle reminder of our dependence on the natural world and its resources. It underscores the importance of conserving and responsibly using these resources. It also alludes to the fact that despite the vastness and plenitude of the world, life can be fragile and susceptible to the whims of nature. \n\nIn a broader sense, the verse also symbolizes the idea that despite apparent abundance, without the right conditions or resources, suffering and hardship can still occur. It is a call for understanding and respecting the natural balance and harmony of our world..The kural verse:ஏரின் உழாஅர் உழவர் புயல்என்னும்வாரி வளங்குன்றிக் கால். ,translates to :Unless the fruitful shower descend, The ploughman's sacred toil must end,and it's explantion is :Kural 14 highlights the interdependence of natural resources and human labor, underscoring the critical role of rain in agriculture. The verse suggests that if the rainfall, which is considered as a source of wealth, diminishes, then the work of the farmer, who relies on the rain for irrigation, must inevitably cease. In other words, without adequate rain, the act of plowing the fields becomes futile as there will be no water to nourish the crops. \n\nThis verse emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balance in nature and how natural phenomena like rain can directly impact human activities. It also subtly reminds us of our responsibility in preserving the environment as our livelihood is tied to it. Any disruption in nature's cycle can lead to a direct impact on our survival and prosperity..The kural verse:கெடுப்பதூஉம் கெட்டார்க்குச் சார்வாய்மற் றாங்கேஎடுப்பதூஉம் எல்லாம் மழை. ,translates to :Destruction it may sometimes pour But only rain can life restore,and it's explantion is :Kural 15 is a profound reflection on the indispensable role of rain in human life and wellbeing. The verse emphasizes that the absence of rain can bring about devastating ruin to people, disrupting their livelihood, especially in agrarian societies where farming is the primary source of sustenance. Without rain, crops fail, leading to scarcity of food and widespread suffering. \n\nConversely, the verse also highlights the restorative power of rain. When rain falls, it brings life back to the parched earth, nourishing the crops, and restoring the livelihood of the people. Rain, in this regard, is seen as a bringer of fortune and prosperity. It replenishes the natural resources, enables the growth of crops, fills the water bodies, and essentially sustains life.\n\nThe central message of this verse is the importance of natural balance and harmony. It underscores the critical need for rain, a fundamental natural element, for the sustenance and prosperity of life. Therefore, it can also be interpreted as an early emphasis on environmental consciousness and the need for maintaining the balance of nature..The kural verse:விசும்பின் துளிவீழின் அல்லால்மற் றாங்கேபசும்புல் தலைகாண்பு அரிது. ,translates to :No grassy blade its head will rear, If from the cloud no drop appear,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural is a profound reflection on the interconnectedness of life and the importance of natural resources. The verse essentially communicates the dependency of life on water, symbolized here by the raindrops from the sky.\n\nThe 'green blade of grass' mentioned in the verse represents all life forms on earth. It signifies that without water, even the simplest and smallest life forms cannot survive. In a broader sense, this verse emphasizes the vital role water plays in the sustenance of life on earth. \n\nIt serves as a reminder that the natural resources of the world are indispensable and we should respect and conserve them. The verse also metaphorically implies that for any creation to grow and thrive, it needs constant nourishment and support, much like the grass needs water. Without such support, progress and growth would be as difficult as spotting a blade of grass in an arid landscape.\n\nThirukkural, through this particular verse, subtly underscores the importance of gratitude and appreciation for the often-overlooked, yet essential elements of life and survival. In doing so, it also encourages humans to live harmoniously with nature, acknowledging and respecting its crucial role in our existence..The kural verse:நெடுங்கடலும் தன்நீர்மை குன்றும் தடிந்தெழிலிதான்நல்கா தாகி விடின். ,translates to :The ocean's wealth will waste away, Except the cloud its stores repay,and it's explantion is :Kural 17 is a profound reflection on the importance of reciprocity and contribution in maintaining the balance of nature and society. The verse uses the water cycle as a metaphor to illustrate this principle.\n\nThe verse states that even the vast ocean can lose its wealth, if the clouds, which absorb water from the ocean, do not give it back as rain. This metaphor represents the interconnectedness and interdependence of natural elements, and how the lack of contribution from one element can lead to the depletion of another.\n\nApplying this to a social context, the verse suggests that individuals who rise to prominence in a society due to its resources and opportunities should give back to that society. If they fail to do so, the society, like the ocean, could face depletion. It emphasizes the importance of sharing and giving back for the sustenance of the collective.\n\nIn essence, Kural 17 emphasizes the principle of reciprocity, both in nature and in society. It underscores that prosperity is sustained not by hoarding, but by sharing; not by taking, but by giving back. This principle resonates with the core virtues of generosity, responsibility, and social commitment..The kural verse:சிறப்பொடு பூசனை செல்லாது வானம்வறக்குமேல் வானோர்க்கும் ஈண்டு. ,translates to :The earth, beneath a barren sky, Would offerings for the gods deny,and it's explantion is :Kural 18 emphasizes the indispensable role of rain or water in maintaining the socio-religious order of the world. It states that if the heavens (symbolic of rain clouds) were to dry up, the yearly festivals and daily worships offered to the celestials (heavenly beings or gods) would come to a halt. \n\nThis is because many religious activities and festivals in ancient times, particularly in agrarian societies like ancient Tamil regions, were closely associated with the agricultural cycle, which in turn depends heavily on the rains. Without rain, there would be no harvest, leading to a lack of resources to conduct these festivals and daily rituals.\n\nMoreover, the verse suggests that water, symbolized here as rain, is not just important for physical sustenance, but also for spiritual well-being. It indirectly stresses the interconnectedness of the physical and spiritual realms, where the absence of one vital element (rain) can disrupt both the mundane and the divine aspects of life.\n\nTherefore, this verse is a profound reminder of the critical importance of environmental balance and the conservation of natural resources for the holistic well-being of society. It's a call for mankind to respect and preserve nature, as its disruption can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not just our material existence but also our spiritual practices and beliefs..The kural verse:தானம் தவம்இரண்டும் தங்கா வியன்உலகம்வானம் வழங்கா தெனின். ,translates to :Were heaven above to fail below Nor alms nor penance earth would show,and it's explantion is :Kural 19 deals with the fundamental importance of rainfall to all life and human activity, including religious and charitable deeds. This verse states that if rain does not fall, the acts of giving alms (charity) and penance (spiritual discipline) would cease to exist in this vast world.\n\nThe rain is essential for agriculture, which in turn provides food. Without food, people would not be able to survive, let alone perform acts of charity or spiritual disciplines. The act of giving alms, or charity, often involves giving food or resources to those in need. In the absence of rain and the subsequent lack of harvest, such acts would become impossible due to the scarcity of resources.\n\nSimilarly, penance or spiritual discipline often requires a certain degree of physical strength and well-being. Without adequate food and nutrition, which ultimately depends on the rains and agriculture, maintaining such discipline would become exceedingly difficult if not impossible.\n\nHence, this verse emphasizes the critical role of rainfall in sustaining life, human activities, charity, and spiritual practices. It underscores the inherent interdependence of the natural world and human life, urging us to acknowledge and respect nature's cycles for the continued survival and well-being of all life..The kural verse:நீர்இன்று அமையாது உலகெனின் யார்யார்க்கும்வான்இன்று அமையாது ஒழுக்கு. ,translates to :Water is life that comes from rain Sans rain our duties go in vain,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 20, emphasizes the significance of water and the rain that brings it, for the proper functioning of the world and the upkeep of righteousness (ozhukkam in Tamil). It essentially indicates that water is crucial for all elements of life and is indispensable for the discharge of one's duties and responsibilities.\n\nThe verse underscores the fundamental dependency of life on water. It argues that if it is believed that no person could fulfill their life's duties without water, it must also be recognized that without rain, there would be no water. Here, 'duties of life' can be seen to encompass both basic survival needs such as drinking and agriculture, and more complex societal responsibilities.\n\nFurthermore, the verse uses the concept of water and rain to emphasize the importance of natural resources and the environment in maintaining the moral and ethical order (ozhukkam). It suggests that without these natural resources, ozhukkam, which could be interpreted as righteousness, moral conduct, or even societal order, would cease to exist. \n\nThis verse, thus, subtly highlights the interconnection between the environment and ethical living, emphasizing the importance of preserving and respecting natural resources. It's also a call for sustainable living and resource management..The kural verse:ஒழுக்கத்து நீத்தார் பெருமை விழுப்பத்துவேண்டும் பனுவல் துணிவு. ,translates to :No merit can be held so high As theirs who sense and self deny,and it's explantion is :Kural 21 celebrates the virtues of those who have mastered self-discipline and abandoned worldly desires while adhering to the moral code of their life. The verse emphasizes that the ultimate aim of all learned treatises is to extol the greatness of such individuals.\n\nIn more detail, the verse recognizes the nobility of those who, while maintaining their ethical conduct, have renounced all material and sensory attachments. Their greatness is held in high regard, deemed superior to any other excellence.\n\nThis verse also underlines the fundamental purpose of all scholarly texts - to highlight and praise such exceptional individuals who embody these virtues. It serves as a reminder that the ultimate strength and virtue lie not in material possessions or sensory pleasures, but in self-control, renunciation, and steadfastness in one's moral conduct.\n\nIn essence, Kural 21 is a tribute to the power of self-discipline and the abandonment of desire. It highlights the high esteem in which such individuals are held, seen as the epitome of virtue and the ultimate aim of all scholarly works..The kural verse:துறந்தார் பெருமை துணைக்கூறின் வையத்துஇறந்தாரை எண்ணிக்கொண் டற்று. ,translates to :To con ascetic glory here Is to count the dead upon the sphere,and it's explantion is :This Kural refers to the greatness of individuals who have renounced all worldly desires. The comparison used here is counting the dead in the world - an impossible task. Similarly, it is impossible to truly measure or quantify the greatness of those who have forsaken materialistic and sensual desires. \n\nThe Kural emphasizes the virtue of renunciation and the spiritual elevation it brings. It suggests that those who have achieved such a state are beyond ordinary understanding or measurement. Their greatness is infinite and immeasurable, much like trying to count every person who has ever died.\n\nJust as it is impossible to count all the dead, it is also impossible to fully comprehend the depth and magnitude of a truly detached individual's greatness. This is because detachment from worldly desires is a profound state that transcends common human experiences and understanding. \n\nThe verse underlines the high regard in which asceticism or renunciation is held in the philosophical thought underpinning Thirukkural. It also subtly encourages the reader to strive for such a state of detachment, as it is a path to spiritual greatness..The kural verse:இருமை வகைதெரிந்து ஈண்டுஅறம் பூண்டார்பெருமை பிறங்கிற்று உலகு. ,translates to :No lustre can with theirs compare Who know the right and virtue wear,and it's explantion is :Kural 23 is a profound reflection on the understanding of life and the pursuit of virtue. The verse highlights the importance of discerning the dual nature of existence and dedicating oneself to righteousness. \n\nThe \"two states of being\" mentioned in the verse can be interpreted as the physical world and the spiritual realm, or alternatively, as the states of pleasure and pain, joy and sorrow, or virtue and vice. Thiruvalluvar emphasizes that those who have comprehended the nature and properties of these dual states, and chosen to renounce worldly pursuits to embrace righteousness, are the ones who truly shine in this world.\n\nThis Kural encourages us to delve into the deeper understanding of life's dualities, to make conscious choices that favor virtue and righteousness, and to rise above mundane worldly pursuits. In doing so, one's true greatness is revealed, which resonates beyond the individual and illuminates the world.\n\nThis verse is a testament to Thiruvalluvar's belief in the power of discernment and moral choice, and his vision of a world enlightened by virtue and righteousness. His wisdom encourages us to pursue a path of self-awareness, ethical discernment, and moral excellence, leading to a life of fulfillment and a world of harmony..The kural verse:உரனென்னும் தோட்டியான் ஓரைந்தும் காப்பான்வரனென்னும் வைப்பிற்கோர் வித்து. ,translates to :With hook of firmness to restrain The senses five, is heaven to gain,and it's explantion is :Kural 24 speaks about the importance of self-control and wisdom in achieving heavenly bliss. The five senses - sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch - are likened to wild elephants that can lead us astray if not properly controlled. The verse suggests that one who can master these senses through the use of wisdom or intellect (referred to as the 'hook') will be like a seed sown in the heavenly realm. This metaphor indicates that such a person will flourish and enjoy a fulfilling existence in higher states of consciousness or spiritual realms.\n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes the power of discipline, self-restraint, and wisdom as essential tools for spiritual growth and divine attainment. The person who successfully exercises control over his or her senses, guided by wisdom, will be rewarded with heavenly blessings and spiritual progress, likened here to a seed that grows into a tree in fertile soil, signifying prosperity and growth in the heavenly world..The kural verse:ஐந்தவித்தான் ஆற்றல் அகல்விசும்பு ளார்கோமான்இந்திரனே சாலுங் கரி. ,translates to :Indra himself has cause to say How great the power ascetics' sway,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse speaks about the power of self-control and the mastery over the five senses - sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. The verse uses the metaphor of Indra, the King of Devas and lord of the heavens, to elaborate on this concept.\n\nThe verse asserts that the person who has successfully subdued his five senses is as powerful as Indra himself. Indra, being an epitome of power and control, is used as a symbol to represent the strength of a person who has achieved complete control over his senses. \n\nIn many Eastern philosophies, the five senses are considered the gateways through which desires and distractions enter our lives, leading us astray from our ethical and moral path. Thus, mastery over these five senses is considered a great achievement, as it allows an individual to stay focused, make right decisions, and lead a life of righteousness and contentment. \n\nThe verse emphasizes that such mastery over senses is not a small feat and equates it to the power and stature of Indra. This metaphor serves to highlight the high regard and reverence given to those who have gained control over their senses and desires. \n\nIn a nutshell, this verse from Thiru Kural teaches us the importance of self-control and mastery over our senses in leading a virtuous and fulfilled life. It encourages us to strive for this self-mastery, promising us immense strength and respect, similar to that enjoyed by Indra, the King of Devas..The kural verse:செயற்கரிய செய்வார் பெரியர் சிறியர்செயற்கரிய செய்கலா தார். ,translates to :The small the paths of ease pursue The great achieve things rare to do,and it's explantion is :Kural 26 emphasizes the distinction between the great and the lesser individuals based on their capability and willingness to undertake challenging tasks. Thiruvalluvar, the poet, asserts that those who are willing and able to accomplish tasks that are considered difficult are truly distinguished or 'great'. These individuals do not shy away from challenges, rather they embrace them and use them as opportunities to demonstrate their abilities and strength of character.\n\nOn the contrary, those who avoid difficult tasks, who choose the path of least resistance, or who are incapable of undertaking challenging tasks are considered 'mean' or lesser. These individuals might prefer comfort over challenge, or they might lack the skill or will to face and overcome obstacles.\n\nThis verse highlights the value of courage, resilience, and determination in achieving greatness. It also subtly implies that greatness is not a matter of birth or status, but a result of one's actions and choices. This is a timeless principle that resonates across cultures and eras, encouraging individuals to step out of their comfort zones and strive for greatness through their actions..The kural verse:சுவைஒளி ஊறுஓசை நாற்றமென ஐந்தின்வகைதெரிவான் கட்டே உலகு. ,translates to :They gain the world, who grasp and tell Of taste, sight, hearing, touch and smell,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse emphasizes the importance of understanding and controlling the five senses - taste, sight, touch, hearing, and smell. These senses are our primary means of experiencing the world, and the one who comprehends their nature and possesses the ability to control them is regarded highly by the world.\n\nThe verse suggests that the world exists within the knowledge of those who have mastered their senses. This mastery doesn't merely mean the physical control over the senses, but more importantly, it implies the mental and emotional regulation of the desires and impulses that arise from these senses. \n\nIn the Indian philosophical context, this mastery over senses, known as 'Indriya Nigraha', is considered as a vital step towards attaining wisdom, peace, and self-realization. It encourages individuals to rise above the sensory pleasures and distractions to grasp the reality of life and the universe. In essence, it underlines the concept of mind over matter. \n\nTherefore, the verse implies that the person who has the ability to understand and control their senses, reigning in their desires and impulses, holds the world within their knowledge. Such individuals can experience life in its full depth and breadth, and they gain respect and recognition from the world..The kural verse:நிறைமொழி மாந்தர் பெருமை நிலத்துமறைமொழி காட்டி விடும். ,translates to :Full-worded men by what they say, Their greatness to the world display,and it's explantion is :Kural 28 highlights the profound impact of the words spoken by wise and learned individuals. These individuals are known for their robust and effective communication, their words always carrying weight and depth. The verse suggests that their wisdom and greatness are not just apparent in their overt actions or direct words, but also in their subtler expressions and hidden meanings. \n\nThe underlying message of this Kural is the importance of wisdom and the power of words. The eloquence and wisdom of an individual can be discerned not just from their explicit statements, but also from their subtle implications and unspoken words. This verse underscores that the greatness of such individuals is enduring and impactful, leaving a lasting impression on the world. \n\nThis verse encourages us to strive for such wisdom and effective communication, emphasizing that our words and actions can have far-reaching implications and highlight our true character and greatness to the world..The kural verse:குணமென்னும் குன்றேறி நின்றார் வெகுளிகணமேயும் காத்தல் அரிது. ,translates to :Their wrath, who've climb'd the mount of good, Though transient, cannot be withstood,and it's explantion is :The Kural 29 emphasizes the virtue of forbearance among those who have mastered the art of goodness. It suggests that even when these virtuous individuals are provoked to the point of anger, their righteousness and inner strength prevent them from harboring this anger for long. Their wrath, even if momentary, is so intense and formidable that it is near impossible for others to withstand or counter it. \n\nThe metaphor of 'ascending the mountain' is used to symbolize the journey and effort it takes to cultivate and embody virtuous qualities. It implies that those who have reached the peak of this metaphorical mountain, have developed a profound understanding of goodness and virtue, making it difficult for them to sustain anger.\n\nThis verse, therefore, urges individuals to strive towards such a state of moral excellence that even the very thought of anger becomes alien to their nature. The virtue of forbearance and self-control is held in high regard in this verse, as it is these qualities that help maintain peace and harmony in society..The kural verse:அந்தணர் என்போர் அறவோர்மற் றெவ்வுயிர்க்கும்செந்தண்மை பூண்டொழுக லான். ,translates to :With gentle mercy towards all, The sage fulfils the vitue's call,and it's explantion is :Kural 30 emphasizes the virtue of compassion and kindness towards all living beings. The term \"Anthanar\" refers to a virtuous person or a person of high moral and ethical standards. According to this verse, the true measure of an Anthanar is not based on their title or position but on their conduct. \n\nThe verse argues that an individual can only be considered virtuous or an 'Anthanar' if they exhibit kindness and compassion in their interaction with all forms of life. It underscores that a person's character is defined by their actions and not by their social status or designation. This Kural thus promotes the virtue of empathy and the importance of treating all creatures with respect and kindness.\n\nIn essence, Kural 30 underlines that to be truly virtuous, one must embody kindness in their interactions with every creature, big or small. The virtue of kindness is universal and transcends social classes and titles, and this is what makes one a true 'Anthanar'..The kural verse:சிறப்புஈனும் செல்வமும் ஈனும் அறத்தினூஉங்குஆக்கம் எவனோ உயிர்க்கு. ,translates to :From virtue weal and wealth outflow; What greater good can mankind know?,and it's explantion is :Kural 31 emphasizes the importance and power of virtue. It suggests that virtue alone can bring both honor and wealth, which are the most sought-after aspects in human life. \n\nIn this context, \"virtue\" refers to the moral righteousness or ethical conduct that is according to the principles of dharma (righteousness). When one leads their life with virtue, they'll not only receive respect and honor from society but also gain wealth. This wealth is not just physical riches, but also the wealth of knowledge, character, and inner peace. \n\nThe verse implies that there is no other path that can provide such rewards for a person. This means, irrespective of the life one leads, the path of virtue is the most rewarding and fulfilling. It is the source of real happiness and contentment that transcends material possessions. \n\nIn a nutshell, this Kural emphasizes that virtue is the ultimate source of happiness, as it provides both honor and wealth, which are the key elements for leading a successful and content life..The kural verse:அறத்தினூஉங்கு ஆக்கமும் இல்லை அதனைமறத்தலின் ஊங்கில்லை கேடு. ,translates to :Virtue enhances joy and gain; Forsaking it is fall and pain,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 32, from the Thirukkural, extols the importance and supremacy of virtue, which is referred to as \"Aram\" in Tamil.\n\nThe verse translates to: \"There can be no greater source of good than (the practice of) virtue; there can be no greater source of evil than the forgetfulness of it\". This implies that the practice of virtue, or righteousness, is the most beneficial act one can perform in life. Virtue is presented as the bedrock of all good deeds and prosperity. There is nothing that can yield greater benefit to a person's life than adhering to virtuous principles.\n\nConversely, forgetting or ignoring the path of virtue can lead to great harm or evil. No harm can surpass the negative consequences that come from neglecting or disregarding virtue. Therefore, the verse is a caution against losing sight of moral and ethical principles in one's life.\n\nIt is a powerful reminder that virtue is not just about doing good deeds but is the foundation of a good life. The verse underlines the significance of virtue in individual development and societal well-being. It also warns about the dire consequences of forgetting or ignoring virtue, emphasizing the importance of continuously practicing and remembering it throughout one's life..The kural verse:ஒல்லும் வகையான் அறவினை ஓவாதேசெல்லும்வாய் எல்லாஞ் செயல். ,translates to :Perform good deeds as much you can Always and everywhere, o man!,and it's explantion is :Kural 33 emphasizes the importance of incessantly practicing virtue in all actions and in all possible ways. It advises that regardless of the nature of the task or the circumstances, one should always choose the path of righteousness and morality. This verse is a call to integrate virtue into our everyday actions, making it a habit rather than an occasional practice.\n\nThe essence of this verse is the belief that morality should not be selective or situational but should be a constant guiding principle. It advocates for a life where every action, no matter how big or small, is performed with ethical consideration and moral integrity. This includes even the smallest acts in the most mundane situations. By doing so, we not only enhance our own moral character but also contribute to a more ethical and just society. \n\nIn short, this verse encourages us to make virtue and righteousness the cornerstone of all our actions, regardless of where we are or what we are doing..The kural verse:மனத்துக்கண் மாசிலன் ஆதல் அனைத்தறன்ஆகுல நீர பிற. ,translates to :In spotless mind virtue is found And not in show and swelling sound,and it's explantion is :Kural 34 stresses on the importance of purity of mind and intention in performing virtuous deeds. According to Valluvar, the author of Thiru Kural, the true essence of virtue lies in the spotless and sincere mind behind the action, not just the action itself. \n\nThe verse suggests that a deed, no matter how virtuous it may appear outwardly, lacks merit if it is not driven by pure intent and a clean conscience. The poet dismisses any act done for mere show or to gain praise as a vain display, devoid of any real virtue.\n\nThis Kural teaches us the importance of integrity and sincerity in our actions. The moral principle here is that the value of a good deed is determined by the purity of the mind and the honesty of the intent behind it, rather than the deed itself. It calls for genuine goodness that springs from the heart, not superficial acts of virtue done for appearance.\n\nIn essence, Valluvar is emphasizing on the significance of inner purity and genuine intention in doing virtuous deeds, stating that without these, all else is just a pointless spectacle..The kural verse:அழுக்காறு அவாவெகுளி இன்னாச்சொல் நான்கும்இழுக்கா இயன்றது அறம். ,translates to :Four ills eschew and virtue reach, Lust, anger, envy, evil-speech,and it's explantion is :Kural 35 emphasizes the essence of virtuous conduct, defining it as the absence of four primary negative traits: malice, desire, anger, and bitter speech. \n\nMalice refers to the resentment one might hold towards others, often because of envy or feeling of injustice. Desire refers to the excessive, uncontrolled cravings that could lead to harmful actions. Anger is a destructive emotion that often leads to regretful actions and bitter speech. Bitter speech, or harsh words, can harm relationships and cause pain to others.\n\nThe Tamil explanations provide similar interpretations. The first one points out that these four traits are incompatible with the path of righteousness. The second one emphasizes that virtuous conduct involves consciously avoiding these negative attributes. The third explanation adds a bit more detail, explaining that envy arises from observing others' superiority, desire leads us to pursue sensual pleasures, anger arises when these are obstructed, and harsh words are born out of this anger.\n\nIn summary, Kural 35 advocates for a life free from envy, uncontrolled desire, anger, and harsh words, considering such a life as the embodiment of virtue and righteousness. It encourages the practice of self-restraint and mindfulness in our thoughts, words, and actions..The kural verse:அன்றறிவாம் என்னாது அறஞ்செய்க மற்றதுபொன்றுங்கால் பொன்றாத் துணை. ,translates to :Do good enow; defer it not A deathless aid in death if sought,and it's explantion is :Kural 36 is a profound verse that emphasizes the importance of practicing virtue immediately, without procrastination. It strongly advocates that one should not delay performing virtuous deeds thinking there will always be a tomorrow. The verse impresses upon us the uncertainty of life and the inevitability of death, urging us to embrace morality and righteousness in the present moment.\n\nThe verse metaphorically presents virtue as a friend who will remain loyal and supportive even at the time of our death, when all else perishes. This friend, the virtue we practiced during our lifetime, will not abandon us but will stand as a testament to our character, leaving behind an undying legacy.\n\nThe Kural highlights the transient and ephemeral nature of material possessions and earthly relations, which cannot accompany us beyond death. In contrast, the virtues we cultivated and the good deeds we performed during our lifetime endure, offering solace, comfort, and an enduring reputation even after we depart from this world. Thus, the Kural urges us to engage in virtuous deeds without delay, as they will serve as our eternal companions. \n\nIn essence, this Kural verse is a wake-up call to each one of us to lead a virtuous life without postponing good deeds to an uncertain future, reminding us of the impermanent nature of life and the eternal value of virtue..The kural verse:அறத்தாறு இதுவென வேண்டா சிவிகைபொறுத்தானோடு ஊர்ந்தான் இடை. ,translates to :Litter-bearer and rider say  Without a word, the fortune's way,and it's explantion is :This Kural emphasizes the evident outcomes of virtuous and non-virtuous conducts by drawing an analogy with the palanquin bearer and the rider. The Kural does not necessitate books to describe the fruits of virtue, as it is apparent in real-life experiences.\n\nThe bearer of the palanquin here represents individuals who follow unethical paths, resulting in hardship and burden. The burdensome task of carrying the palanquin symbolises the hardships and sufferings they bear as a result of their non-virtuous actions. They struggle, much like the palanquin bearer struggles under the weight of his load.\n\nOn the other hand, the person riding the palanquin symbolises those who adhere to the path of righteousness. They enjoy the comforts and privileges of their virtuous actions, just as the rider enjoys the ease of travel in the palanquin.\n\nIn essence, this Kural demonstrates the contrasting outcomes of ethical and unethical behaviours. It encourages the path of virtue by illustrating the tangible benefits and comforts it brings, while also warning against the path of vice by highlighting the hardships it brings..The kural verse:வீழ்நாள் படாஅமை நன்றாற்றின் அஃதொருவன்வாழ்நாள் வழியடைக்கும் கல். ,translates to :Like stones that block rebirth and pain Are doing good and good again,and it's explantion is :Kural 38 emphasizes the significance of doing good deeds every single day. It says that if one ensures that not even a single day passes without doing something good or beneficial, then such consistent acts of righteousness will act as a barrier to future rebirths. This concept is based on the Hindu belief of karma and reincarnation, where the nature of one's actions in the present life determines the state of the next life. \n\nThus, the verse encourages continuous good actions as they not only enrich one's present life but also pave the way for a better future life. It advocates a life of virtue and righteousness, reminding us that consistent good deeds have the power to shape our destiny and spiritual journey. By interpreting this verse, one can understand that the path to spiritual liberation and achieving a good life lies in our day-to-day actions. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar suggests that our actions are like stones shaping the course of a river. Just as strategic placement of stones can alter the river's path, our consistent good actions can shape our life course, potentially preventing us from the cycle of rebirth and leading us to spiritual liberation..The kural verse:அறத்தான் வருவதே இன்பம் மற்றெல்லாம்புறத்த புகழும் இல. ,translates to :Weal flows only from virtue done The rest is rue and renown gone,and it's explantion is :Kural 39 emphasizes the significance of virtue in achieving true happiness and praise in life. It posits that only pleasure derived from ethical and virtuous conduct is authentic and worthy. This verse suggests that any form of happiness or pleasure that is not rooted in virtue lacks authenticity and is devoid of any real worth or commendation.\n\nThe context here largely revolves around the concept of domestic virtue, which includes the moral and ethical actions taken within the family or household. It underscores that the joy derived from adhering to moral principles in one's personal and domestic life holds true value.\n\nThe pleasure gained from any other sources or means that are not aligned with virtue is considered hollow and undeserving of praise, as they lack the foundational principles of integrity and morality.\n\nThe essence of this Kural, therefore, is that the pursuit of virtue should be integral to one's existence, as it is the path to genuine happiness and commendation. Any diversion from this path results in superficial joy and unworthy accolades..The kural verse:செயற்பால தோரும் அறனே ஒருவற்குஉயற்பால தோரும் பழி. ,translates to :Worthy act is virtue done Vice is what we ought to shun,and it's explantion is :Kural 40 asserts the fundamental principle of virtue and vice. The verse explains that virtue is any action that a person should actively pursue, while vice is anything that they should consciously avoid.\n\nVirtue, in this context, is not just limited to actions that are morally right but also include deeds that contribute to the betterment of oneself and society. It is the path of righteousness that one should strive to follow.\n\nVice, on the other hand, refers to actions that are morally wrong, harmful, or detrimental to oneself or others. It is the path that one should consciously shun or avoid.\n\nIn essence, this verse encourages individuals to actively engage in virtuous deeds while consciously avoiding actions that are considered vices. The verse emphasizes that the act of doing good and refraining from harm is the true measure of a person's character and the path to gaining respect and honor. \n\nIt's also important to understand that this Kural encourages proactive morality, where individuals are not just avoiding harmful actions but actively pursuing good deeds. This approach ensures a positive impact on the individual and the society they are part of. \n\nThis Kural is a timeless principle that remains relevant across cultures and ages, highlighting the universal appeal of Thiru Kural's wisdom..The kural verse:இல்வாழ்வான் என்பான் இயல்புடைய மூவர்க்கும்நல்லாற்றின் நின்ற துணை. ,translates to :The ideal householder is he Who aids the natural orders there,and it's explantion is :The verse 41 from Thiru Kural emphasizes the responsibilities and duties of a householder. It states that a true householder is someone who provides unwavering support to the virtuous people belonging to three groups - parents, spouse, and children.\n\nThe verse imparts the importance of moral and ethical support in a family setup. The householder is not just an individual who provides material comfort but also a moral backbone who aids in the righteous path.\n\nThe three groups mentioned in this verse are significant. Parents, who are the originators of life, are the first to receive support, acknowledging the principle of gratitude and respect towards elders. The spouse, who shares the journey of life, is the second, emphasizing the importance of companionship and mutual support. Lastly, children, who are the future bearers of the family legacy, reaffirming the duty of parents to provide guidance and nurture their growth.\n\nThis verse highlights the cultural value of family in Tamil society, where a family is not just a social construct but a spiritual and moral unit. Every member has their responsibilities, and the householder's duty is to ensure that this unit thrives in righteousness, thus contributing to the overall goodness and integrity of the society..The kural verse:துறந்தார்க்கும் துவ்வாதவர்க்கும் இறந்தார்க்கும்இல்வாழ்வான் என்பான் துணை. ,translates to :His help the monk and retired share, And celibate students are his care,and it's explantion is :Kural 42 emphasizes the importance of compassion and aid to those in need as a cornerstone of a prosperous domestic life. The verse states that a person who assists those who have renounced the world (monks, ascetics), those who are destitute (the poor), and those who have passed away (by performing last rites or helping their families), is considered to hold high moral virtues and leads a successful and meaningful domestic life.\n\nThis verse underscores the value of selflessness and generosity. It suggests that true domestic virtue isn't about the accumulation of wealth or material possessions, but rather about the willingness to help and support those in need. In this context, the 'dead' refers to performing the duties and rituals owed to the deceased, which is seen as a final act of respect and help.\n\nBy highlighting these acts of kindness and duty, the verse encourages empathy and altruism. It serves as a reminder that our value in life is often determined by our actions towards others, particularly those less fortunate or in need of our assistance. This verse instills the idea that a life lived in service to others is a life well-lived, which aligns with the core principles of many philosophies and religions worldwide..The kural verse:தென்புலத்தார் தெய்வம் விருந்தொக்கல் தானென்றாங்குஐம்புலத்தாறு ஓம்பல் தலை. ,translates to :By dutiful householder's aid God, manes, kin, self and guests are served,and it's explantion is :Kural 43 delves into the primary duties of a householder in society, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a balance between different spheres of interpersonal relationships and personal responsibility. It highlights the five-fold rule of conduct that a householder should adhere to for a harmonious living. \n\n1) Towards the Manes (Deceased Ancestors): As per the Tamil culture, it is believed that the spirits of the deceased ancestors continue to watch over their descendants. The Kural instructs that remembering and paying respects to the ancestors is a vital duty. \n\n2) Towards the Gods: The Kural underscores the importance of acknowledging and worshipping the divine. This is not just about religious observance but also an expression of gratitude and reverence towards the higher power that governs life. \n\n3) Towards Guests: In Indian culture, guests are considered as gods (Atithi Devo Bhava). The Kural emphasizes that respecting and treating guests kindly is an essential responsibility of a householder. \n\n4) Towards Relations: The Kural stresses the importance of maintaining good relationships with kith and kin. A householder should ensure harmony within the family and social circle by being respectful and caring. \n\n5) Towards Self: The Kural highlights that while fulfilling all these duties, one should not neglect one's own well-being. Personal development, self-care, and maintaining moral integrity are equally important.\n\nBy beautifully integrating these five duties, the Kural offers a blueprint for a householder to lead a balanced, respectful, and fulfilling life. It teaches us that our obligations extend beyond our immediate selves and that we have responsibilities towards our ancestors, the Gods, our guests, our relations, and importantly, ourselves..The kural verse:பழியஞ்சிப் பாத்தூண் உடைத்தாயின் வாழ்க்கைவழியெஞ்சல் எஞ்ஞான்றும் இல். ,translates to :Sin he shuns and food he shares His home is bright and brighter fares,and it's explantion is :The Kural 44 emphasizes on leading a virtuous life in the domestic sphere, focused on two key principles: the fear of wrongdoing in acquiring wealth and the act of sharing one's food with others.\n\nThe first half of the verse suggests that one should earn their wealth ethically, fearing the vice or sin that comes with ill-gotten gains. This principle is rooted in the belief that wealth gained without moral compromise brings prosperity not only to the individual but also to their descendants.\n\nThe second half of the verse advocates for sharing, specifically sharing one's food. This act of generosity is seen as a virtue in many cultures, and in this context, it symbolizes sharing one's resources or wealth with those in need. \n\nCollectively, these two principles form a moral code for individuals and families. If adhered to, Thiruvalluvar suggests that such a household will never fail, implying a continuous line of descendants who will thrive due to their forebearer's virtuous conduct. In essence, the verse is a guide on how to achieve lasting prosperity and a commendable legacy, not through material accumulation alone but through ethical actions and generosity..The kural verse:அன்பும் அறனும் உடைத்தாயின் இல்வாழ்க்கைபண்பும் பயனும் அது. ,translates to :In grace and gain the home excels, Where love with virtue sweetly dwells,and it's explantion is :Kural 45 discusses the essence of married life, stating that love and virtue are the primary components that make it meaningful, dignified, and beneficial. This Kural refers to 'anbu' (love) and 'aran' (virtue) as the pillars of a marital relationship. If a couple possesses these values, their life together becomes both duty (panbu) and reward (payan). \n\nThe term 'anbu' here refers to a deep and affectionate bond between the couple, which upholds the relationship despite challenges. 'Aran', on the other hand, signifies the moral and ethical behaviors that guide the couple in their interactions with each other and with society. These ethical behaviors include truthfulness, kindness, respect, and shared responsibilities.\n\nIn essence, the Kural emphasizes that a marriage that embodies love and virtue will naturally possess a sense of duty and will reap its own rewards. The duty here implies the responsibilities that come with marriage, and the reward signifies the fulfillment, happiness, and contentment that the couple derives from a harmonious and respectful relationship.\n\nTherefore, this Kural recommends that love and virtue should be the guiding principles of a married life, as they bring about a sense of duty and confer invaluable rewards, making life meaningful..The kural verse:அறத்தாற்றின் இல்வாழ்க்கை ஆற்றின் புறத்தாற்றில்போஒய்ப் பெறுவ தெவன்? ,translates to :Who turns from righteous family To be a monk, what profits he?,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural encourages individuals to live a virtuous and ethical life in their domestic setting, rather than seeking spiritual growth in an ascetic or hermit-like lifestyle. \n\nIn simpler terms, it questions what one would gain by renouncing his domestic responsibilities and adopting an ascetic lifestyle, if he is already living a virtuous life at home. It emphasizes the idea that spiritual growth and moral living are not confined to a life of seclusion or renunciation, but can be achieved in everyday domestic life by adhering to moral and ethical principles.\n\nIt challenges the common belief that one needs to abandon worldly life to attain spiritual enlightenment. Instead, it advocates that true spirituality is about living ethically and righteously in whatever life situation one finds themselves in. It suggests that a life of virtue and righteousness in the household can yield the same spiritual benefits as an ascetic life.\n\nIn essence, the verse encourages individuals to find spirituality in their everyday lives and not to feel the need to renounce the world to achieve spiritual growth..The kural verse:இயல்பினான் இல்வாழ்க்கை வாழ்பவன் என்பான்முயல்வாருள் எல்லாம் தலை. ,translates to :Of all who strive for bliss, the great Is he who leads the married state,and it's explantion is :This verse (Kural 47) from Thirukkural emphasizes the significance of leading a virtuous household life. The verse asserts that amongst all who strive for a virtuous life, the one who skillfully and righteously leads a household life is the greatest.\n\nThe context here is about leading a good, virtuous life. Many people strive to lead a virtuous life, and they put in efforts and labor towards that goal. However, according to the philosophy of Thirukkural, the one who can successfully manage a household life while maintaining moral standards is considered the most virtuous.\n\nA household life comes with a unique set of challenges and responsibilities. It requires a balance in managing personal ambitions, family responsibilities, societal expectations, and moral standards. The ability to maintain this balance while leading a life of virtue is considered as the hallmark of a truly virtuous person.\n\nIn essence, this verse celebrates those who live a virtuous life in the household context, highlighting that such a life requires wisdom, patience, discipline, and a keen understanding of moral and ethical principles. It reinforces the idea that the highest virtue is to lead a righteous and balanced life in the midst of worldly responsibilities and challenges..The kural verse:ஆற்றின் ஒழுக்கி அறனிழுக்கா இல்வாழ்க்கைநோற்பாரின் நோன்மை உடைத்து. ,translates to :Straight in virtue, right in living Make men brighter than monks praying,and it's explantion is :This particular Kural (verse 48) emphasizes the importance of leading a righteous life while being a householder (someone who lives a worldly life with family responsibilities) and encouraging others to do the same. \n\nThe verse suggests that if a householder helps others in their path of righteousness without deviating from their own path of virtue, their life holds a greater significance than those who perform rigorous penance (ascetics).\n\nThe householder's life is not devoid of challenges, temptations, or responsibilities, but they stay committed to their path of virtue regardless. They also take the responsibility to guide others, ensuring they too follow the path of righteousness. \n\nIn doing so, they demonstrate great endurance, which in some ways surpasses the endurance of ascetics who renounce the world to perform penance. This Kural essentially celebrates the strength and virtue of the householder, highlighting the profound impact they can have on society by leading and encouraging a righteous life..The kural verse:அறனெனப் பட்டதே இல்வாழ்க்கை அஃதும்பிறன்பழிப்ப தில்லாயின் நன்று. ,translates to :Home-life and virtue, are the same; Which spotless monkhood too can claim,and it's explantion is :Kural 49 emphasizes the respect and dignity attached to the married life, terming it as a state of virtue or 'Aram' - a term in Tamil that signifies righteousness. It suggests that a life lived with a spouse, free from blame or wrongdoings, represents the true essence of virtue or moral righteousness.\n\nHowever, it also implies that an unmarried or ascetic life could be equally virtuous, only if it is free from reproach or blame from others. This verse acknowledges the possibility of leading a virtuous life outside marriage as well, but it emphasizes the importance of maintaining a life that is beyond reproach, regardless of one's marital status.\n\nIt essentially conveys the message that the worth of a life is determined not by marital status, but by the absence of reproach, indicating the timeless value of leading a righteous and blameless life..The kural verse:வையத்துள் வாழ்வாங்கு வாழ்பவன் வான்உறையும்தெய்வத்துள் வைக்கப் படும். ,translates to :He is a man of divine worth Who lives in ideal home on earth,and it's explantion is :The Kural 50 emphasizes the sanctity of leading an honorable life in the marital or conjugal state. The verse suggests that those who live their life on earth fulfilling their duties and responsibilities in the marital life, respecting and caring for their spouse, will be revered as divine beings. \n\nThis verse highlights the importance of relationships and marital life in human existence. It underscores the moral duty of individuals to uphold the sanctity of marriage, to lead a life of mutual respect, love, commitment, and understanding. \n\nThe notion of being 'placed among the Gods' signifies the high regard and respect that society bestows upon those who lead an exemplary marital life. It does not merely imply a reward in the afterlife but is a metaphorical representation of the reverence and admiration one gains in this life itself.\n\nThus, this verse teaches us about the importance of marital ethics, and how adhering to them can elevate one's status to that of divinity. It further underscores the Tamil societal values that regard a harmonious marital life as one of the highest virtues..The kural verse:மனைக்தக்க மாண்புடையள் ஆகித்தற் கொண்டான்வளத்தக்காள் வாழ்க்கைத் துணை. ,translates to :A good housewife befits the house, Spending with thrift the mate's resource,and it's explantion is :Kural 51 praises the virtues of a wife who understands and practices good household management. The verse emphasizes two key qualities: her understanding of home values and her ability to live within her husband's means.\n\nThe \"excellence of home virtues\" refers to a woman's ability to maintain harmony within the household, her understanding of responsibilities, her kindness, her ability to nurture relationships within the family, and her respect for the traditions and values that guide the home. This makes her an indispensable pillar of the house, promoting a nurturing and peaceful environment.\n\nThe second part refers to a woman's ability to manage the household within the economic means of her husband. This is a crucial aspect that determines the financial stability of a family. It requires her to be prudent in expenditure, resourceful, and thrifty without compromising on the essential needs and comforts of the family.\n\nTherefore, a woman who embodies these two qualities is considered a great support in the domestic sphere, contributing significantly to the smooth functioning and prosperity of the household and thus, to her husband's life. It's a celebration of a woman's role in maintaining the well-being and balance of the family..The kural verse:மனைமாட்சி இல்லாள்கண் இல்லாயின் வாழ்க்கைஎனைமாட்சித் தாயினும் இல். ,translates to :Bright is home when wife is chaste If not all greatness is but waste,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural, Kural 52, emphasizes the importance of a wife's role in maintaining harmony and balance within a household. It suggests that no matter how prosperous or successful a life might be in other aspects, if the wife lacks the qualities of domestic excellence, the conjugal life is incomplete and lacks fulfillment.\n\nThe term \"domestic excellence\" refers to the qualities of understanding, compassion, respect, and the ability to manage the household effectively. It includes nurturing relationships, taking care of family members, and maintaining peace and order in the household.\n\nThe verse underscores the importance of shared responsibility and partnership in a marriage. It suggests that the true worth of a successful life is measured not just by materialistic achievements or social standing, but also by the harmony and satisfaction within one's home life. This is only possible when both partners contribute equally towards it, and a wife's role is considered crucial in this aspect.\n\nTherefore, this kural advises that one must value and nurture the qualities of domestic excellence in a wife, as they are key to a fulfilling and balanced life. It advocates for the mutual respect, understanding, and shared responsibilities between partners in a marital relationship..The kural verse:இல்லதென் இல்லவள் மாண்பானால் உள்ளதென்இல்லவள் மாணாக் கடை? ,translates to :What is rare when wife is good What can be there when she is bad?,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural emphasizes the profound impact a virtuous wife can have on a man's life. It suggests that a man who is married to a woman of great virtue essentially possesses all that he could ever need in life. Her goodness, moral integrity, and righteous conduct bring a wealth of blessings that enrich his life in every way.\n\nOn the contrary, if a man's wife lacks virtue and moral qualities, it implies that he essentially possesses nothing of real value, regardless of his material wealth or social status. This is because the absence of virtue and goodness in his partner will cast a shadow over his life, robbing it of joy, peace, and moral richness. \n\nTherefore, this verse underscores the importance of virtue and moral qualities in a wife, asserting that they are the true indicators of wealth and prosperity in a man's life..The kural verse:பெண்ணின் பெருந்தக்க யாவுள கற்பென்னும்திண்மைஉண் டாகப் பெறின். ,translates to :What greater fortune is for men Than a constant chaste woman?,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural emphasizes the value and significance of a woman's chastity. The verse translates to \"What is more excellent than a wife, if she possess the stability of chastity?\" This highlights the moral virtue of chastity, which is considered a woman's greatest strength and honor in traditional Tamil culture.\n\nIn the verse, Valluvar uses the word \"karpu,\" which is often interpreted as chastity or virtue. However, its meaning goes beyond mere physical purity and extends to mental and emotional integrity, moral righteousness, and unwavering loyalty to one's spouse.\n\nThe verse places the woman at a high pedestal, asserting that nothing is more superior or excellent than a chaste woman. If a woman possesses the stability of chastity, she becomes the bedrock of a prosperous family and society, as she upholds the moral values strongly.\n\nThis verse thus advocates the value of fidelity and moral purity in a woman, and by extension, in all relationships. It underscores the importance of maintaining these virtues for a harmonious and prosperous societal structure..The kural verse:தெய்வம் தொழாஅள் கொழுநன் தொழுதெழுவாள்பெய்யெனப் பெய்யும் மழை. ,translates to :Her spouse before God who adores, Is like rain that at request pours,and it's explantion is :Kural 55 emphasizes the power of a woman's devotion to her husband, portraying it as a force that even the natural elements, such as rain, bow to. The verse suggests that a woman who reveres her husband as a divine being, not needing to worship any other deity, possesses such a power that if she commands the rain to fall, it will. \n\nThis verse does not just highlight the power of devotion, but it also underscores the sanctity of the marital relationship, placing it on a pedestal equivalent to a divine bond. The woman's devotion to her husband is depicted as so potent that her command could influence the course of nature.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that this verse is a reflection of the cultural and societal norms prevalent during the period when Thirukkural was written. The concept of a wife's absolute devotion and servitude to her husband is deeply rooted in traditional Indian and Tamil societies. This verse should be viewed in the context of those times.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse could be interpreted as the power of true devotion and faith, regardless of the object of that devotion. When one's faith is strong and unwavering, it can bring about miraculous results, akin to making it rain on command..The kural verse:தற்காத்துத் தற்கொண்டாற் பேணித் தகைசான்றசொற்காத்துச் சோர்விலாள் பெண். ,translates to :The good wife guards herself from blame, She tends her spouse and brings him fame,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural talks about the true qualities of a virtuous wife. According to the verse, a woman can be considered an ideal wife when she diligently guards her chastity, cares for her husband, and maintains an impeccable reputation.\n\nIt emphasizes three critical aspects. First, it talks about a wife's self-guardianship, which refers to her commitment and fidelity to her husband, upholding the sanctity of their marital bond. Second, it highlights her role in looking after her husband's wellbeing, indicating her nurturing and supportive nature. Lastly, it underscores the importance of preserving an unsullied fame. This means that she should conduct herself in a manner that brings honor and respect to her family, thereby enhancing their social standing.\n\nThis verse reflects the traditional Tamil societal norms where a woman's role was primarily defined in the context of her relationship with her husband and family. While some of these concepts may seem dated in the contemporary context, the underlying essence of mutual respect, care, and maintaining personal and family honor remains relevant across cultures and times..The kural verse:சிறைகாக்கும் காப்பெவன் செய்யும் மகளிர்நிறைகாக்கும் காப்பே தலை. ,translates to :Of what avail are watch and ward? Their purity is women's guard,and it's explantion is :The Kural 57 highlights the importance of personal virtues and self-discipline in one's life, particularly concerning women in the context of the society during the time of Thiruvalluvar. \n\nThe verse metaphorically compares the confinement of women to prisons guarded by watchmen. It states that the physical restrictions imposed on women, in terms of their mobility or interaction, are of little significance. Such restrictions are comparable to the guards of a prison, who merely enforce external control. \n\nHowever, the verse emphasizes that the primary guard of a woman is her chastity, symbolizing her personal virtues, moral integrity, and self-discipline. This internal control is far more important than any external restrictions. It is her inner strength and moral values that truly protect her, allowing her to lead a life of dignity and respect.\n\nIn essence, the kural suggests that personal virtues and self-regulation are more effective safeguards than any external control or constraints. This concept is universal, extending beyond the specific context of women. It underlines the importance of self-discipline and moral integrity in maintaining one's dignity and respect in society..The kural verse:பெற்றாற் பெறின்பெறுவர் பெண்டிர் பெருஞ்சிறப்புப்புத்தேளிர் வாழும் உலகு. ,translates to :Women who win their husbands' heart Shall flourish where the gods resort,and it's explantion is :Kural 58 emphasizes the importance of respect and reverence in a marital relationship, particularly from a wife to her husband. This verse doesn't advocate for subservience but rather highlights the significance of mutual respect and understanding in a relationship.\n\nThe verse states that if a woman shows respect to her husband, she will attain great excellence in the world where even the divine prosper. Essentially, it highlights that the act of showing reverence can lead to prosperity and well-being, not just in the material realm but also in the spiritual world.\n\nThis verse reflects the societal norms and values of the time when Thiru Kural was written. Today, the verse can be interpreted as a call for mutual respect and understanding in any relationship, marital or otherwise, for the creation of a harmonious and prosperous society. \n\nThe cultural context of this verse is rooted in the traditional Indian philosophy, which places high regard on cordial family relationships as a path to spiritual and societal well-being. The verse underlines the belief that a harmonious and respectful marital life can lead to overall prosperity and happiness. \n\nHowever, this verse should not be interpreted as a suggestion that only women should show respect to their partners. Instead, it serves as a reminder that respect and love in a relationship can lead to an elevated existence, akin to the divine..The kural verse:புகழ்புரிந்த இல்லிலோர்க்கு இல்லை இகழ்வார்முன்ஏறுபோல் பீடு நடை. ,translates to :A cuckold has not the lion-like gait Before his detractors aright,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural emphasizes the significance of a virtuous and chaste wife in a man's life. In essence, it states that a man whose wife does not seek the praise of virtue and chastity cannot walk with pride and dignity in front of those who criticize or revile him. \n\nIn the cultural context of ancient Tamil society, a wife's chastity was regarded as a reflection of her husband's honor and status. A man whose wife was not committed to the values of virtue and chastity was often subjected to ridicule and derision in society. \n\nThis verse underscores the importance of virtue and chastity, not just for women, but also for men, as it affects their honor and respect in society. It implies that a man's social standing and dignity are largely influenced by the character and conduct of his wife. \n\nTherefore, this verse encourages individuals to pursue and uphold virtues like chastity and integrity, which in turn contribute to their respect and honor in society. The man who has such a wife can walk with a lion-like stately step, a metaphor indicating pride, strength, and dignity..The kural verse:மங்கலம் என்ப மனைமாட்சி மற்று அதன்நன்கலம் நன்மக்கட் பேறு. ,translates to :An honest wife is home's delight And children good are jewels abright,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 60, emphasizes the importance and the value of a virtuous wife and good children in a person's life. \n\nThe first line signifies that the true prosperity or auspiciousness of a household lies in the virtue of the wife. A wife with good character and virtues brings happiness, peace and good fortune to her husband and their household. Her wisdom, compassion, and integrity reflect on her husband's well-being, making his life more meaningful and fulfilled. \n\nThe second line further adds that the true jewels or adornments of this happiness and prosperity brought by a virtuous wife are the good children. Good children here don't imply just well-behaved or obedient children but those who grow up to be morally upright, kind, and responsible individuals. They are the living testaments of the virtues inculcated by their mother in the household. These children are the ones who carry forward the legacy of their parents and bring honor and respect to their family.\n\nIn essence, this verse highlights that a virtuous wife and well-raised children are the true wealth and pride of a family..The kural verse:பெறுமவற்றுள் யாமறிவது இல்லை அறிவறிந்தமக்கட்பேறு அல்ல பிற. ,translates to :The world no higher bliss bestows Than children virtuous and wise,and it's explantion is :The verse 61 of Thirukkural emphasizes the importance and value of having intelligent children. Among all the benefits and riches one could accumulate in life, the kural suggests there is nothing more rewarding than the gift of wise and knowledgeable offspring. \n\nThis verse underlines the idea that children who possess wisdom and understanding are the greatest wealth one can have. They are seen as the ultimate benefit because they not only carry forth the family lineage but also contribute positively to society with their knowledge and insight.\n\nThe cultural context here is deeply rooted in the traditional Indian belief system, where having children, especially those who are intellectually gifted, is considered a great blessing and a symbol of true prosperity. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse also speaks to the idea that true wealth isn't necessarily material possessions but the nurturing and development of wise and informed individuals who can make meaningful contributions to their community and the world at large. The emphasis is on the value of knowledge, wisdom, and enlightened living, rather than on material gain. \n\nSo, this verse, while praising the joy and value of having intelligent children, also subtly highlights the importance of nurturing wisdom and knowledge in the younger generation..The kural verse:எழுபிறப்பும் தீயவை தீண்டா பழிபிறங்காப்பண்புடை மக்கட் பெறின். ,translates to :No evil comes and no blemish; Noble sons bring all we wish,and it's explantion is :Kural 62 emphasizes the significance of raising children with good character and moral principles. It states that those who are successful in nurturing their offspring to be virtuous and free from malice will be spared from the hardships and tribulations of seven births. \n\nThe \"seven births\" is a concept rooted in Hindu philosophy, referring to the cycle of rebirth or reincarnation. According to this belief, a person's actions and moral conduct in this life determine the quality of their next life. Thus, the verse suggests that the merit earned from raising morally upright children can protect parents from suffering in their future lives.\n\nThe verse underscores the importance of imparting good values, ethics, and morals to the younger generation. It holds the belief that raising children with a good disposition is not just beneficial for society, but also has spiritual benefits for the parents themselves. This verse essentially encourages parents to invest in the moral upbringing of their children as a way to ensure a better future for themselves and their offspring. \n\nIn conclusion, this verse from Thiru Kural highlights the powerful role of parents in shaping the character of their children and emphasizes the spiritual benefits they gain from doing so..The kural verse:தம்பொருள் என்பதம் மக்கள் அவர்பொருள்தம்தம் வினையான் வரும். ,translates to :Children are one's wealth indeed Their wealth is measured by their deed,and it's explantion is :Kural 63 underlines the concept of children as valuable assets, not merely in a material sense, but more importantly, in terms of the moral and ethical actions they perform on behalf of their parents. \n\nThe verse emphasizes that children are considered the true wealth of parents. This is not due to any material possessions they might bring, but due to the actions they perform, the deeds they undertake, and the values they uphold. The 'wealth' here refers to the virtuous actions of the children, which reflect upon the parents and bring them honor and respect in society.\n\nThis Kural, therefore, highlights the importance of good deeds and moral conduct, which are esteemed more highly than material possessions. It underscores the notion that it is the character and actions of a person, rather than their material wealth, that truly defines their value.\n\nThus, the verse encourages parents to instill good values and moral conduct in their children, as their actions will ultimately reflect on the parents themselves. This also underlines the significant role of parents in shaping their children's character and values. \n\nIn essence, the verse stresses the fact that children, through their deeds, become the true wealth of their parents. Hence, good parenting involves nurturing children to become responsible, ethical, and virtuous individuals..The kural verse:அமிழ்தினும் ஆற்ற இனிதேதம் மக்கள்சிறுகை அளாவிய கூழ். ,translates to :The food is more than nectar sweet In which one's children hands insert,and it's explantion is :Kural 64 deals with the profound love and affection between parents and their children. The verse metaphorically compares the sweetness of ambrosia, a divine and heavenly food often associated with immortality, to the simple food touched or dabbled by the little hands of children. \n\nThe Kural says that to a parent, the food touched by their own children gives a pleasure that exceeds even that of the divine ambrosia. This is a metaphorical way of saying that the joy and love parents derive from their children surpass all other worldly pleasures or luxuries. Even the simplest gestures of their children can bring unparalleled joy to them. \n\nThis Kural underlines the depth of parental love, which is unconditional and pure. It emphasizes that the happiness derived from children and their innocent actions is incomparable to any other materialistic or worldly pleasures. The joy of parenthood transcends all other forms of enjoyment and satisfaction. \n\nThus, the verse beautifully captures the essence of parental love and the sheer joy that children can bring into one's life. This is a universal truth that transcends all cultural and geographic boundaries..The kural verse:மக்கள்மெய் தீண்டல் உடற்கின்பம் மற்றுஅவர்சொற்கேட்டல் இன்பம் செவிக்கு. ,translates to :Children's touch delights the body Sweet to ears are their words lovely,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse beautifully encapsulates the joy and pleasure that parents derive from their children. The first part of the verse, \"the touch of children gives pleasure to the body,\" signifies the physical connection and affection parents feel for their children. The simple act of touching, hugging, or holding their children can provide immense joy and happiness, a sense of comfort and warmth that is incomparable. \n\nThe second part, \"the hearing of their words, pleasure to the ear,\" refers to the delight parents experience when they hear their children speak. Whether it is the first words of a baby, the imaginative stories of a toddler, or the insightful conversations with a growing child, listening to them can bring a unique sense of gratification and contentment. \n\nThus, this verse emphasizes the profound emotional bond between parents and their children, and how these simple interactions can bring significant happiness and pleasure. It also subtly highlights the importance of cherishing these moments, as they contribute to the overall joy of parenthood..The kural verse:குழல்இனிது யாழ்இனிது என்பதம் மக்கள்மழலைச்சொல் கேளா தவர். ,translates to :The flute and lute are sweet they say Deaf to baby's babble's lay!,and it's explantion is :Kural 66 is a beautiful expression of parental love and the joy that parents derive from their children. The verse metaphorically compares the sweetness of musical instruments to the innocent prattle of children. \n\nIn this verse, Thiruvalluvar states that people who have not experienced the joy of hearing their own children's babble might claim that the music from a pipe or a lute is the sweetest. The verse subtly implies that the innocent and joyful prattle of one's own children is incomparably sweeter and more delightful than any music. \n\nThis verse underscores the inexpressible joy and emotional fulfillment that parenthood brings. It emphasizes that the simple, everyday experiences of parenthood, like listening to the innocent babble of one's children, offer profound happiness that transcends the enjoyment found in other pleasures of life, such as music. \n\nIn a broader sense, the verse highlights the importance of personal experiences and emotional connections in deriving joy and satisfaction. It suggests that while music from instruments can be universally appreciated for its sweetness, the emotional resonance and personal connection make the innocent chatter of one's children even sweeter to the parents..The kural verse:தந்தை மகற்காற்றும் நன்றி அவையத்துமுந்தி இருப்பச் செயல். ,translates to :A father's duty to his son is  To seat him in front of the wise,and it's explantion is :Kural 67 can be interpreted as emphasizing the important role of a father in his child's education and personal development. According to this verse, the greatest service a father can provide for his son is to equip him with the knowledge and wisdom that position him with respect and recognition among the learned and wise. \n\nThis implies that the father's responsibility is not just to provide for the physical needs of the child, but more importantly, to nurture the child's intellectual and moral growth. The verse suggests that a well-rounded education that fosters critical thinking, ethical understanding, and a spirit of inquiry is the most precious gift a father can give to his son. \n\nIn the assembly of the learned, precedence is given to those who have proven their knowledge and wisdom. Therefore, preparing his son for such recognition is the best way a father can ensure his son's successful future. This Kural underlines the importance of education and intellectual development in the ancient Tamil society, and these values hold true even in the modern age. \n\nIn essence, Kural 67 underscores the profound impact of a father's contribution to his child's intellectual development and societal recognition. It encourages parents to prioritize their child's education and moral upbringing as the ultimate act of parental love and responsibility..The kural verse:தம்மின்தம் மக்கள் அறிவுடைமை மாநிலத்துமன்னுயிர்க் கெல்லாம் இனிது. ,translates to :With joy the hearts of parents swell  To see their children themselves excel,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the value of knowledge and education. It states that the joy one experiences when their children acquire knowledge surpasses even their own personal satisfaction. This joy is not limited only to the parents but extends to everyone in society. \n\nIn the cultural context of ancient Tamil society, education was seen as a collective responsibility and achievement, not just a personal one. The growth and development of every child were seen as beneficial for the entire community and society at large. This verse reinforces this collective sentiment by highlighting that the acquisition of knowledge by children brings joy and satisfaction to everyone, not just their parents.\n\nMore broadly, this verse underscores the timeless importance of education. It sends the message that the pursuit of knowledge should be a fundamental goal for individuals and society. Furthermore, it asserts that the joy derived from seeing the younger generation grow in wisdom and knowledge transcends personal satisfaction and becomes a source of collective happiness and pride. \n\nIn essence, this Kural verse encourages us to value and prioritize education, recognizing it as a shared joy and collective achievement, rather than just an individual accomplishment..The kural verse:ஈன்ற பொழுதின் பெரிதுவக்கும் தன்மகனைச்சான்றோன் எனக்கேட்ட தாய். ,translates to :The mother, hearing her son's merit  Delights more than when she begot,and it's explantion is :Kural 69 emphasizes the joy experienced by a mother when her son is praised by others as wise and virtuous. This joy, according to Thiruvalluvar, greatly surpasses the happiness she felt at the time of his birth. \n\nThe verse is a celebration of wisdom and virtue, two qualities that Thiruvalluvar often extols. It suggests that the ultimate joy for a parent is not just the birth of a child, but in the child's growth into a person of good character and wisdom. The pride and joy that a mother feels when her son is praised as a wise man are greater than the joy she felt at his birth, a moment typically considered one of the happiest in a parent's life. \n\nMoreover, this Kural also subtly underlines the importance of education and character-building in a child's upbringing. It implies that birthing a child is just the first step of parenthood. The more significant task is to raise the child to be a wise individual, respected and praised by society. This Kural, therefore, not only highlights the joy of successful parenthood but also underscores the responsibility and long-term commitment involved in raising a child..The kural verse:மகன்தந்தைக்கு ஆற்றும் உதவி இவன்தந்தைஎன்நோற்றான் கொல் எனும் சொல். ,translates to :The son to sire this word is debt  \\\"What penance such a son begot!\\\",and it's explantion is :Kural 70 discusses the duty of a son towards his father. It suggests that the greatest service a son can render to his father is to live a life of such virtue and accomplishment that others wonder about the extraordinary merits or penance the father must have performed to beget such a son. \n\nThe Thirukkural emphasizes the importance of leading a life that brings honour to one's parents. The son's achievements are seen as a reflection of the father's virtues, and the son's conduct should thus make the father a subject of praise and admiration in society.\n\nIn other words, the son should strive to be a person of such character and caliber that people will commend the father for raising such an outstanding individual. This verse implies that the best way to repay a father's love and sacrifices is by attaining excellence and earning respect in society, thereby bringing honor to the father. \n\nThis is a timeless principle that holds true even today, across cultures and societies - children should aim to make their parents proud through their actions and achievements..The kural verse:அன்பிற்கும் உண்டோ அடைக்குந்தாழ் ஆர்வலர்புன்கணீர் பூசல் தரும். ,translates to :What bolt can bar true love in fact  The tricking tears reveal the heart,and it's explantion is :Kural 71 explores the profound nature of love and affection. It asks rhetorically, \"Can love ever be truly concealed or restrained?\" implying that genuine love cannot be suppressed or hidden. The verse suggests that the true depth of one's affection for another often reveals itself when the loved one is in distress or suffering. This is symbolically represented by the shedding of tears. \n\nThe second line of the verse, \"Tears of the affectionate will publish the love that is within\", emphasizes that emotional reactions such as tears are a spontaneous and honest expression of the love concealed within one's heart. In other words, even though one might try to hide their feelings of love, their emotional reactions will inevitably reveal the truth. \n\nThis verse highlights the enduring and revealing nature of love. It suggests that genuine love cannot be suppressed or hidden, and will always find a way to express itself, especially in times of distress or suffering. It underscores the powerful, emotional, and transparent nature of true affection. \n\nIn terms of cultural context, this verse reflects the emphasis placed on love and affection in Tamil culture and literature. It also highlights the value of empathy and emotional expressiveness in human relationships. The moral interpretation here is the importance of sincerity and authenticity in expressing love and affection. It encourages us not to suppress our feelings, but to let them show, especially in times of need, as this is the most genuine expression of love..The kural verse:அன்பிலார் எல்லாம் தமக்குரியர் அன்புடையார்என்பும் உரியர் பிறர்க்கு. ,translates to :To selves belong the loveless ones;  To oth'rs the loving e'en to bones,and it's explantion is :Kural 72 presents a profound perspective on the concept of love and how it shapes one's attitude towards self and others. It suggests that those who lack love, or the ability to care for others, tend to view everything they possess - be it material wealth, skills, or even their own bodies - as solely theirs. They cannot perceive beyond their individual needs and wants, and hence are incapable of sharing or giving.\n\nOn the contrary, those who possess love in their hearts, view everything they have as something that could be used for the benefit of others. Such individuals are not confined by the notion of ownership. Instead, they are willing to share their resources, their skills, and even go to the extent of sacrificing their own physical comfort for others. \n\nThis verse emphasizes the transformative power of love, which makes one selfless and compassionate. It encourages us to cultivate love in our hearts, to view our possessions not as personal property, but as resources that can be used for the common good. In essence, it suggests that true love is about giving, sharing, and caring for others. \n\nThe cultural context of this verse stems from the ancient Tamil society, where the virtue of love and sharing was held in high esteem. But its moral interpretation is universal and timeless, promoting a selfless and generous attitude towards others..The kural verse:அன்போடு இயைந்த வழக்கென்ப ஆருயிர்க்குஎன்போடு இயைந்த தொடர்பு. ,translates to :Soul is encased in frame of bone  To taste the life of love alone,and it's explantion is :This Thirukkural verse suggests that the union of a soul with a body is considered to be the result of the amalgamation of love and virtue from a previous existence. In essence, it draws an analogy between the physical union of body and soul, and the spiritual union of love and virtue. \n\nJust as the body is lifeless without the soul, any action is devoid of its value without love. It is the love and virtue inherent in us that guide our actions, and these actions, in turn, determine the form of life we lead. \n\nIn terms of cultural context, this verse reflects the Hindu belief in reincarnation and karma, suggesting that the love and virtue we exhibit in one life can influence our physical form in the next. \n\nOverall, this verse emphasizes the importance of love and virtuous actions, hinting at their potential to shape our future existences. It also highlights the interconnectedness of our physical and spiritual selves, reminding us that our actions, driven by love and virtue, have profound consequences beyond the present life..The kural verse:அன்புஈனும் ஆர்வம் உடைமை அதுஈனும்நண்பு என்னும் நாடாச் சிறப்பு. ,translates to :Love yields aspiration and thence  Friendship springs up in excellence,and it's explantion is :Kural 74 explores the chain reaction of love, desire, and friendship. It posits that love, characterized by affection and warmth towards others, naturally leads to desire. This desire is not of a selfish or covetous nature but rather a longing to engage, understand, and connect deeply with others. \n\nThis desire then begets what is referred to as 'the immeasurable excellence of friendship'. The term 'immeasurable excellence' signifies the limitless value and profound depth of genuine friendship. It is a bond that transcends the mundane and the superficial, reaching into the realm of profound human connection. \n\nThe verse, therefore, underscores the intricate interplay of love, desire, and friendship. It emphasizes the inherent virtue of love as a catalyst for developing deep and meaningful relationships, thereby advocating for the cultivation of love as a means to enrich our social interactions and bonds. \n\nIn a broader cultural context, this Kural resonates with the foundational ethos of Tamil society, which places a high premium on love, kinship, and communal harmony. It is a testament to the timeless wisdom encapsulated in Thirukkural about the essence of human relationships..The kural verse:அன்புற்று அமர்ந்த வழக்கென்ப வையகத்துஇன்புற்றார் எய்தும் சிறப்பு. ,translates to :The crowning joy of home life flows  From peaceful psychic love always,and it's explantion is :Kural 75 emphasizes the importance of love and compassion as a core component of a content and fulfilling life. It suggests that the highest achievement one can obtain in this world is experiencing true joy and that such joy is derived from living a life filled with love. \n\nThis verse essentially asserts that those who live in happiness and contentment in the world owe their success to their loving disposition. Their greatness lies in their ability to maintain a loving and compassionate approach towards their fellow beings. It underscores the idea that a life lived with love is a life lived in joy, and such a life is the highest achievement and the ultimate reward.\n\nIn other words, the verse tells us that living a life rooted in love and compassion brings about genuine happiness, which in turn bestows a unique distinction or honor upon the individual. This is the real fruit of leading a life filled with love. It is a timeless message highlighting the power of love as a pathway to joy and fulfillment..The kural verse:அறத்திற்கே அன்புசார் பென்ப அறியார்மறத்திற்கும் அஃதே துணை. ,translates to :\\\"Love is virtue's friend\\\" say know-nots  It helps us against evil plots,and it's explantion is :Kural 76 emphasizes the power and universality of love. The verse suggests that the ignorant perceive love only as an ally to virtue, believing it to be supportive and beneficial solely in the context of moral and righteous actions. However, Valluvar, the author, argues that love is not confined to virtue alone. It also plays a significant role in helping individuals extricate themselves from vice or immoral behaviors.\n\nThe underlying message of this Kural is the transformative and redeeming power of love. It can motivate individuals to abandon wrongdoings and move towards righteousness. Hence, love is not just a companion of virtue but also a deterrent of vice. It is an omnipresent force that can influence all aspects of human behavior, from the noblest of deeds to the correction of wrongdoings.\n\nTherefore, it is erroneous to limit the impact of love only to virtuous actions, as it has a broader role in shaping human character and actions. To understand love in its true essence is to acknowledge its presence and influence in all spheres of life, both virtuous and unvirtuous..The kural verse:என்பி லதனை வெயில்போலக் காயுமேஅன்பி லதனை அறம். ,translates to :Justice burns the loveless form  Like solar blaze the boneless worm,and it's explantion is :Kural 77 delves into the profound interrelationship between love (anbu) and virtue (aram). The verse argues that without love, virtue can become a source of internal torment, rather akin to the suffering of a boneless creature exposed to the harsh sun.\n\nThe metaphor of a boneless creature, such as a worm, is used to portray the vulnerability and defenselessness of a soul devoid of love. Just as a worm lacks the necessary protection against the scorching sun, a soul without love lacks the essential substance to withstand the demanding aspects of virtue. Virtue, in this context, is seen as a rigorous path that demands self-sacrifice, service, and integrity. While these attributes are indeed admirable, without the cushioning effect of love, they can lead to a sense of harshness, rigidity, and self-inflicted pain.\n\nTherefore, the verse emphasizes the importance of love as a quintessential component in the practice of virtue. Love softens the edges, provides motivation, and gives meaning to our virtuous actions. It acts as the 'bone' or the supportive structure that helps us endure and flourish in our moral journey. Without love, virtue could become a burning sun, leading to spiritual discomfort and exhaustion.\n\nIn essence, Kural 77 teaches us that love is not just an emotion but a necessary ingredient in our ethical conduct, making our pursuit of virtue a joyful and fulfilling experience rather than a burdensome task. It urges us to foster love in our hearts, for it is the foundation upon which the edifice of virtue stands firm..The kural verse:அன்பகத் தில்லா உயிர்வாழ்க்கை வன்பாற்கண்வற்றல் மரந்தளிர்த் தற்று. ,translates to :Life bereft of love is gloom  Can sapless tree in desert bloom?,and it's explantion is :Kural 78 is a profound illustration of the importance of love in life. The verse metaphorically compares a life devoid of love to a withered tree flourishing in a parched desert.\n\nIn essence, the verse states that just as a withered tree in a barren desert can't truly flourish, a life without love is devoid of true joy and fulfillment. The tree may seem to flourish when it sprouts leaves, but its existence is ultimately futile as it is in a barren, lifeless environment. Similarly, a person may seem to live a prosperous life, but without love in their heart, their life is empty and meaningless. \n\nThe verse emphasizes that love is vital for a fruitful and fulfilling life. It's the emotional nourishment that brings joy, peace, and meaning to our existence. Without it, life is akin to a barren desert, devoid of true growth and prosperity. \n\nThe moral insight from this verse is an enduring reminder of the importance of cultivating love in our hearts. Regardless of our material prosperity or success, without love, our lives are as barren and as futile as a withered tree in a desert..The kural verse:புறத்துறுப் பெல்லாம் எவன்செய்யும் யாக்கைஅகத்துறுப்பு அன்பி லவர்க்கு. ,translates to :Love is the heart which limbs must move,  Or vain the outer parts will prove,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse emphasizes the primacy of love or compassion as an essential human trait. The verse states, \"Of what avail are all the external members (of the body) to those who are destitute of love, the internal member.\"\n\nThe verse metaphorically contrasts the physical parts of the body (external members) with the emotion of love (internal member). The \"external members\" represent the physicality of a person, including their appearance, actions, and material possessions. In contrast, the \"internal member\" signifies the emotional and moral aspects of a person, particularly the virtue of love.\n\nThiruvalluvar, the author, questions the value of physical attributes and material possessions in the absence of love. He implies that without love, all other aspects of a person lose their significance. Regardless of one's physical beauty, wealth, or status, if they lack love or compassion, these external features are of no value. \n\nThe verse thus underscores the importance of nurturing inner virtues like love and compassion, which are more valuable and essential than external, material possessions. It is a reminder that the true measure of a person lies not in their outward appearance or wealth, but in their capacity for love and kindness..The kural verse:அன்பின் வழியது உயிர்நிலை அஃதிலார்க்குஎன்புதோல் போர்த்த உடம்பு. ,translates to :The seat of life is love alone;  Or beings are but skin and bone!,and it's explantion is :Kural 80 emphasizes the inherent value of love in giving life its true meaning. According to the verse, a body filled with love is considered to be truly alive, as it is the love within us that animates our existence and gives life its vibrancy and purpose. The verse suggests that a life without love is akin to a lifeless body, a mere skeletal structure covered with skin, devoid of the emotional vitality that defines living. \n\nThe metaphor of a 'bone overlaid with skin' is used to depict a life devoid of love, suggesting such a life lacks depth, warmth, and the essential human connection. The verse implies that love forms the essence of life and without it, we are akin to the walking dead, physically present but emotionally and spiritually vacant. \n\nThis verse underscores the importance of love in our lives, not just in terms of romantic love, but also in terms of compassion, empathy, and kindness towards others. It is a call to infuse love into our actions, thoughts, and behaviors, thereby enriching our lives and the lives of those around us. Love, according to this verse, is not just an emotion, but a way of life that defines our very existence..The kural verse:இருந்தோம்பி இல்வாழ்வ தெல்லாம் விருந்தோம்பிவேளாண்மை செய்தற் பொருட்டு. ,translates to :Men set up home, toil and earn  To tend the guests and do good turn,and it's explantion is :Kural 81 discusses the fundamental essence of household life and the acquisition of wealth. According to this verse, the primary purpose of leading a domestic life and accumulating wealth is to extend hospitality and aid to those who visit and seek help.\n\nHospitality, in the context of this verse, is not limited to welcoming guests into one's home, but it extends to providing assistance - monetary or otherwise, to those in need. The verse emphasizes that all activities related to domesticity, whether it's maintaining a home or saving money, are ultimately aimed at supporting this benevolence.\n\nThe verse promotes a sense of community, urging people to use their resources to help others. It advocates for a society where individuals don't amass wealth for their own gratification, but share it generously with those who come to their door. The verse endorses the belief that the true value of wealth lies not in hoarding it, but in using it to extend kindness and aid to others..The kural verse:விருந்து புறத்ததாத் தானுண்டல் சாவாமருந்தெனினும் வேண் டற்பாற் றன்று. ,translates to :To keep out guests cannot be good  Albeit you eat nector-like food,and it's explantion is :Kural 82 emphasizes on the moral value of hospitality, asserting that it is not appropriate to eat alone while one's guests are outside, even if the meal is as precious as a life-giving elixir. The verse highlights the importance of sharing and treating guests with respect and generosity. \n\nIn Tamil culture, guests are considered as gods (Atithi Devo Bhava) and are to be treated with the utmost respect and hospitality. Even if the host has food that could grant immortality, it is seen as ethically wrong to consume it alone while the guests are waiting outside. The underlying principle of this verse is the virtue of sharing and being considerate of others' needs. It underscores the belief that the joy of eating increases manifold when shared with others.\n\nSo, this verse is a call for selflessness and generosity, advocating that one should always consider the well-being and comfort of their guests before their own, regardless of the circumstances..The kural verse:வருவிருந்து வைகலும் ஓம்புவான் வாழ்க்கைபருவந்து பாழ்படுதல் இன்று. ,translates to :Who tends his guests day in and out  His life in want never wears out,and it's explantion is :Kural 83 is an ode to the virtue of hospitality. It suggests that the life of a person who consistently welcomes and takes care of guests will never be ruined by poverty or hardships.\n\nIn the Tamil culture, guests are considered as godly figures, and it is a moral responsibility to treat them with utmost respect and care. This Kural emphasizes the importance of this virtue and assures that the act of generosity and hospitality will be rewarded by preventing one's life from being overcome by hardship and poverty. \n\nEssentially, the Kural conveys that the act of giving and sharing, especially with those who visit us, creates a protective shield against adversity in life. This could be because the act of giving enhances the giver's own sense of fulfilment and joy, which in turn enriches their life. \n\nMoreover, this continuous act of hospitality promotes a sense of community, goodwill, and mutual support, which are vital for a fulfilling life. Thus, the Kural encourages the practice of hospitality as a means of creating a prosperous and resilient life. \n\nThis verse is a reminder that the generosity we extend towards others is ultimately a gift to ourselves, as it shields us from the downfall of poverty and hardship, ensuring a life of abundance and prosperity..The kural verse:அகனமர்ந்து செய்யாள் உறையும் முகனமர்ந்துநல்விருந்து ஓம்புவான் இல். ,translates to :The goddess of wealth will gladly rest  Where smiles welcome the worthy guest,and it's explantion is :Kural 84 emphasizes on the virtue of hospitality, specifically towards the virtuous individuals, and the rewards it brings in the form of prosperity. The verse states that when a person welcomes good-hearted guests with a cheerful countenance and genuine happiness, the goddess of wealth, Lakshmi, takes residence in their home with joy.\n\nThe Kural suggests that one's attitude towards their guests and the generous hospitality they extend is a significant determinant of the prosperity they acquire. It emphasizes the cultural value attached to treating guests with respect, kindness, and generosity. \n\nThis verse does not merely refer to material wealth but also to the spiritual and moral richness one gets in the company of virtuous individuals. The joyous welcoming of such individuals into one's home can lead to an enriching exchange of wisdom, knowledge, and values. Thus, the wealth mentioned here is both material and spiritual, indicating a balanced, prosperous life.\n\nIn a broader context, this Kural instills the importance of warmth and generosity in our interactions with others. It encourages us to foster a welcoming and open-hearted environment that not only attracts material wealth but also cultivates moral and spiritual richness..The kural verse:வித்தும் இடல்வேண்டும் கொல்லோ விருந்தோம்பிமிச்சில் மிசைவான் புலம். ,translates to :Should his field be sown who first  Feeds the guests and eats the rest?,and it's explantion is :Kural 85 is a beautiful verse that emphasizes the virtue of hospitality and selflessness. The verse is posed as a rhetorical question, asking if it is necessary to sow seeds in the field of a person who prioritizes his guests' needs over his own. This is a metaphorical question, implying that such a person, who serves his guests first and consumes only what remains, is so virtuous that nature itself might reward him without the need for laborious sowing.\n\nIn the traditional Tamil culture, hospitality is considered a highly esteemed virtue. It was customary to treat guests with utmost respect, providing them with the best of what one has to offer, even if it means the host has to make do with less. \n\nThis verse extols such selfless hosts, suggesting that their generosity and selflessness might render their labor unnecessary, as the universe itself may provide for them. The moral here is to always put others' needs before one's own, and that generosity will be rewarded in unexpected ways..The kural verse:செல்விருந்து ஓம்பி வருவிருந்து பார்த்திருப்பான்நல்வருந்து வானத் தவர்க்கு. ,translates to :Who tends a guest and looks for next  Is a welcome guest in heaven's feast,and it's explantion is :Kural 86 emphasizes the virtues of hospitality and generosity. The verse speaks about a person who not only warmly welcomes and entertains the guests who have arrived but also eagerly anticipates and looks forward to the arrival of more guests. Their home is always open, ready to receive and serve more visitors. This person's hospitality is so profound and heartfelt that they are always on the lookout for more opportunities to serve.\n\nThe verse suggests that such a person, who is selfless and generous in their hospitality, will be welcomed as a cherished guest in heaven. The inhabitants of heaven, the divine beings, will receive this person with the same warmth and hospitality that they showed others on earth. This is a moral reward for their kindness and generosity during their earthly existence.\n\nIn a broader sense, the verse encourages us to be open-hearted and generous, to serve others without expecting anything in return. It tells us that our kindness and generosity will not go unnoticed, and we will be rewarded in heaven, reinforcing the concept of Karma - what we give to the world, we receive back, either in this life or the next. \n\nThe verse underscores the high regard in which hospitality is held in Tamil culture, where a guest is considered equivalent to God (\"அதிதி தேவோ பவ\"). It instills a sense of duty towards fellow beings and promotes the spirit of sharing and caring in society..The kural verse:இனைத்துணைத் தென்பதொன் றில்லை விருந்தின்துணைத்துணை வேள்விப் பயன். ,translates to :Worth of the guest of quality  Is worth of hospitality,and it's explantion is :Kural 87 highlights the virtue of hospitality and the immeasurable benefits it bestows upon the host. This kural essentially says that the merits gained from providing hospitality are incalculable and the only measure of its worth is the worthiness of the guests who are entertained.\n\nThe verse strongly emphasizes the importance of benevolence and hospitality in the Tamil culture. It encourages individuals to welcome guests into their homes and extend their kindness towards them, considering it a form of sacred duty or sacrifice (velvi). \n\nHowever, the virtue of the guests entertained plays a significant role in determining the benefits reaped from this practice. If the guests are virtuous and worthy, the benefits and merits gained are immense. Thus, the verse advises careful selection of guests, because the virtue of the guests is directly proportional to the benefits derived from hospitality. \n\nOverall, this verse promotes the practice of hospitality and benevolence, while also asserting the need for discernment in choosing the guests to whom such hospitality is extended..The kural verse:பரிந்தோம்பிப் பற்றற்றேம் என்பர் விருந்தோம்பிவேள்வி தலைப்படா தார். ,translates to :Who loathe guest-service one day cry:  \\\"We toil and store; but life is dry\\\",and it's explantion is :Kural 88 talks about the importance of hospitality and the regret one may feel for not having been hospitable when they had the means.\n\nIn this verse, Thiruvalluvar emphasizes the virtue of hospitality. He states that those who have accumulated wealth, but have not used it for the act of hospitality, will eventually feel regret. They will lament the missed opportunities to use their wealth in a meaningful way. The phrase 'without support' implies not only the lack of physical assistance but also the lack of emotional satisfaction and fulfilment that comes from helping others.\n\nThe verse also underscores the transient nature of material wealth. It suggests that wealth, once lost or spent, cannot offer comfort or support. The only real, lasting support comes from the goodwill and gratitude of those we have helped and hosted.\n\nHence, the Kural advises that wealth should not be hoarded but used for good deeds like hospitality which not only brings joy to others but also gives a sense of purpose and satisfaction to oneself. It reminds us that the practice of hospitality, of welcoming and taking care of guests, is a meaningful way to use one's wealth and resources. In the long run, these acts of kindness and generosity may provide more support and comfort than the wealth itself..The kural verse:உடைமையுள் இன்மை விருந்தோம்பல் ஓம்பாமடமை மடவார்கண் உண்டு. ,translates to :The man of wealth is poor indeed  Whose folly fails the guest to feed,and it's explantion is :Kural 89 asserts the importance of hospitality, even in the midst of wealth. The verse states that refusing to be hospitable is a form of poverty, even in the presence of abundant wealth. The stupidity referred to here is the inability or unwillingness to extend hospitality to others, which is considered a form of impoverishment. \n\nThis Kural highlights the cultural value placed on hospitality in traditional Tamil society. Guests are held in high regard and are to be treated with utmost respect and care. Failure to do so is seen as a sign of moral poverty and ignorance, irrespective of one's material wealth. \n\nIn essence, the verse is a critique on those who hoard wealth and refuse to share it with others, especially guests. It underscores the principle that the true value of wealth lies not in its accumulation but in its distribution and in the goodwill it can generate. \n\nTherefore, the rich who fail to exercise hospitality are considered poor in virtue and wisdom. This verse implies that true wealth is not merely about material possessions but also includes the wealth of kindness, compassion, and generosity..The kural verse:மோப்பக் குழையும் அனிச்சம் முகந்திரிந்துநோக்கக் குநழ்யும் விருந்து. ,translates to :Anicham smelt withers: like that  A wry-faced look withers the guest,and it's explantion is :Kural 90 emphasizes the importance of hospitality and the subtleties of body language in welcoming guests. It uses the metaphor of the Anicham flower, which is known to wilt quickly once plucked and smelled, to convey how the warmth of a guest's reception can quickly fade when the host's face shows signs of unwelcome or indifference.\n\nThe verse illustrates that just as the Anicham flower loses its vitality and appeal when it is handled without care or appreciation, a guest's comfort and sense of welcome can also diminish when they perceive a lack of genuine hospitality from the host. This can be as subtle as the host turning their face away, which can be interpreted as a sign of disinterest or discomfort.\n\nIn a broader context, the verse is a reminder of the cultural importance placed on hospitality in Tamil society, where guests are considered as gods ('athithi devo bhava'). It underscores the need for genuine warmth and respect in one's interactions with others, whether they are guests in our homes or people we meet in our daily lives.\n\nThe verse thus teaches us the importance of being a gracious host and treating our guests with kindness and respect. It also highlights the significance of non-verbal cues in communication and how our body language can deeply affect the feelings and comfort of those around us..The kural verse:இன்சொலால் ஈரம் அளைஇப் படிறுஇலவாம்செம்பொருள் கண்டார்வாய்ச் சொல். ,translates to :The words of Seers are lovely sweet  Merciful and free from deceit,and it's explantion is :Kural 91 emphasizes the importance of speaking words that are not only pleasant but also truthful and filled with love. These words, as per the verse, should be devoid of any deceit or hidden agendas. The verse suggests that only those who are virtuous and who have a clear understanding of the truth have the ability to speak such words. \n\nThe verse underscores the value of honesty, love, and integrity in communication. It implies that words spoken with genuine love and without deceit not only sound sweet to the listeners but they also reflect the virtue of the speaker. This aligns with the broader theme of Thiru Kural which promotes a life of virtue, truthfulness, and love towards all beings. \n\nIn essence, the Kural encourages us to cultivate the habit of honest and loving communication, as it not only enriches our personal interactions but also elevates us as morally upright individuals..The kural verse:அகன்அமர்ந்து ஈதலின் நன்றே முகனமர்ந்துஇன்சொலன் ஆகப் பெறின். ,translates to :Sweet words from smiling lips dispense  More joys than heart's beneficence,and it's explantion is :Kural 92 is a profound statement on the power of kindness and pleasant words. It suggests that a cheerful countenance and sweet speech can hold more value than a gift given with joy. This verse underscores the importance of how we interact with others and the impact of our words and demeanor. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, the author, is saying that the act of giving, while noble, can sometimes be less significant than the way we communicate and present ourselves. A gift given with a joyous mind is indeed a good deed, but a person who speaks with kindness and maintains a cheerful demeanor can create a more lasting and meaningful impact. \n\nThe verse prompts us to understand that material gifts may provide temporary joy, but sincere and sweet words can touch a person's heart and influence their spirit in a profound way, which can be much more valuable and enduring. \n\nThiruvalluvar encourages us to use our speech and demeanor as gifts, to bring joy, comfort, and encouragement to others. This reflects the ancient Tamil cultural ethos, which places high value on the power of language and cordial behavior. The emphasis is on the humane aspect of interactions rather than materialistic exchanges. \n\nIn summary, Kural 92 extols the virtues of sweet speech and a cheerful countenance, asserting their superiority over material gifts given with a joyous mind. It encourages us to be mindful of our interactions, to use our words and expressions as tools of kindness and to understand their potential to bring joy and comfort to others..The kural verse:முகத்தான் அமர்ந்து இனிதுநோக்கி அகத்தானாம்இன்சொ லினதே அறம். ,translates to :Calm face, sweet look, kind words from heart  Such is the gracious virtue's part,and it's explantion is :Kural 93 emphasizes the virtue of kind and endearing speech that is genuine and heartfelt. The verse conveys that the true nature of virtue lies not just in the sweetness of words, but it should also be reflected in a person's pleasant demeanor and sincere gaze. \n\nThe verse encourages one to speak words that are not only pleasant to the ears, but also spring from a place of love and goodwill in the heart. It stresses the importance of congruity between what is felt inside (in the heart) and what is expressed outside (through the face and words). \n\nThe verse implies that a cheerful countenance, combined with a genial look and sweet words, is the embodiment of virtue. It suggests that such behavior brings joy and positivity to others, fostering an environment of goodwill and harmony. \n\nIn essence, Thiru Kural here underlines the importance of authenticity in our interactions with others. It teaches us that true virtue is not just about saying nice things, but it's about saying them with sincerity, a warm heart, and a welcoming smile..The kural verse:துன்புறூஉம் துவ்வாமை இல்லாகும் யார்மாட்டும்இன்புறூஉம் இன்சொ லவர்க்கு. ,translates to :Whose loving words delight each one  The woe of want from them is gone,and it's explantion is :Kural 94 emphasizes the power of kind and pleasant speech in all interactions; it states that those who consistently use sweet and endearing words towards everyone will not face the distressing hardships of poverty. \n\nThe Kural implies that the act of speaking kindly is a form of wealth in itself, as it elicits goodwill, respect, and support from others. This moral wealth shields the individual from the destitution and sorrow that poverty can bring. \n\nThe verse also underscores the concept of universal benevolence, encouraging the reader to treat all individuals - regardless of their social standing or relationship - with the same kindness and respect. \n\nIn a broader sense, the Kural suggests that the way we communicate with others has a significant impact on our circumstances. Pleasant and considerate speech can create a supportive and beneficial environment, while harsh or unkind words can lead to isolation and hardship. This timeless wisdom holds relevance even in contemporary society, where the quality of our interactions can significantly affect our personal and professional lives..The kural verse:பணிவுடையன் இன்சொலன் ஆதல் ஒருவற்குஅணியல்ல மற்றுப் பிற. ,translates to :To be humble and sweet words speak  No other jewel do wise men seek,and it's explantion is :Kural 95 talks about the true ornaments of a person, which are humility and pleasant speech. These virtues outshine any physical adornments a person might wear. They represent the inner beauty and moral character of an individual, which are far more valuable and attractive than external decorations.\n\nHumility, the ability to remain modest and respectful, is a virtue that instills a sense of humanity, making one approachable and amiable. It creates an aura of affability around the person and forms a strong foundation for ethical behavior.\n\nSweetness of speech, on the other hand, refers to the ability to communicate kindly and politely, creating a positive impression on others. It reflects the person's refinement and consideration for others' feelings. \n\nThe poet asserts that these two virtues are the real ornaments of a person. Other physical ornaments like jewelry or fine clothing might enhance one's appearance, but they do not contribute to their character or moral worth. A person's true value lies not in their physical adornments but in their virtuous characteristics. \n\nIn essence, this verse highlights the importance of inner beauty and moral virtues over superficial appearances, a timeless wisdom that holds relevance even in the present times..The kural verse:அல்லவை தேய அறம்பெருகும் நல்லவைநாடி இனிய சொலின் ,translates to :His sins vanish, his virtues grow  Whose fruitful words with sweetness flow,and it's explantion is :Kural 96 emphasizes the importance and power of positive and kind communication. It suggests that if a person consciously chooses to speak words that are beneficial and pleasant to others, two significant outcomes will occur: first, their sins or negative actions will decrease, and second, their virtue or righteousness will flourish.\n\nThis verse essentially stresses the transformative power of speech. It implies that speech, when used wisely and kindly, can serve as a tool for moral and spiritual growth. By discarding harmful, negative, or unnecessary words and focusing on uttering words that bring goodness and joy to others, one can indeed cultivate virtue within oneself and in their surroundings.\n\nThe wisdom of this verse is timeless. In today's world, where harsh words and criticism are often the norm, the verse encourages us to choose words that are not only useful but also sweet. It reminds us that our words can have a profound effect on others and ourselves. Thus, it promotes mindfulness in our communication, urging us to use our words as seeds of virtue and goodness.\n\nIn summary, Thirukkural 96 advocates for a conscious and mindful approach to communication, where one's words are chosen not only for their usefulness but also for their ability to bring joy and positivity. It suggests that such an approach can lead to personal growth, diminishing one's negative actions and enhancing their virtue..The kural verse:நயன்ஈன்று நன்றி பயக்கும் பயன்ஈன்றுபண்பின் தலைப்பிரியாச் சொல். ,translates to :The fruitful courteous kindly words  Lead to goodness and graceful deeds,and it's explantion is :The verse 97 of Thirukkural suggests that words that offer beneficial outcomes without compromising on pleasantness are the most valuable. These words bring joy to the speaker and benefits to the recipients, thus embodying righteousness in this world and earning merit for the next. \n\nFrom a cultural perspective, this verse underlines the importance of thoughtfully chosen words and respectful communication in Tamil society. It indicates that the kind of speech that is both beneficial and pleasant is the highest form of communication, being able to bring about positive changes in the world and also ensuring the speaker's spiritual merit in the afterlife. \n\nThe moral interpretation here is that our speech should not only be intended to benefit others but also to do so in a way that is pleasing and respectful. It is not just about what we say, but how we say it, and the impact it has on others. This principle can be applied in all aspects of life, from personal interactions to professional communication, emphasizing the power and responsibility that comes with speech..The kural verse:சிறுமையுவு நீங்கிய இன்சொல் மறுமையும்இம்மையும் இன்பம் தரும். ,translates to :Kind words free from meanness delight  This life on earth and life the next,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 98, emphasizes the power of kind and considerate words. The verse suggests that words that are sweet and devoid of any harm or malice towards others bring joy and happiness not only in the present life but also in the afterlife.\n\nThe verse underlines the importance of using gentle and uplifting language when communicating with others. These words, free from any form of negativity or derogatory undertone, bear the potential to bring about peace and harmony in one's life and environment. They also reflect on the speaker's character, portraying them as individuals of high moral standing.\n\nThe verse also introduces a spiritual dimension, suggesting that such benign words can earn one merit in their next life. It aligns with many religious and spiritual beliefs that advocate for good deeds, including the use of kind words, as a means to attain a better life in the hereafter.\n\nIn essence, the verse encourages one to be mindful of their speech, ensuring it is always filled with kindness and respect towards others. Such an approach to communication not only enhances one's present life experience but also paves the way for a promising afterlife..The kural verse:இன்சொல் இனிதீன்றல் காண்பான் எவன்கொலோவன்சொல் வழங்கு வது? ,translates to :Who sees the sweets of sweetness here  To use harsh words how can he dare?,and it's explantion is :This Kural emphasizes the power and beauty of kind, gentle speech. It questions why anyone who understands the joy that a pleasant word can bring would ever choose to use harsh or hurtful language. \n\nThe verse is a reminder that words have the power to heal or hurt. It urges us to speak carefully and kindly, considering the impact our words can have on others. If one truly grasps the happiness that kind words can generate, the use of harsh language becomes pointless and self-defeating. \n\nIn essence, the Kural is an advocacy for empathy and understanding in our communication, promoting the use of pleasant words that foster positivity and harmony in our interactions..The kural verse:இனிய உளவாக இன்னாத கூறல்கனிஇருப்பக் காய்கவர்ந் தற்று. ,translates to :Leaving ripe fruits the raw he eats  Who speaks harsh words when sweet word suits,and it's explantion is :Kural 100 offers a simple yet profound wisdom about the power of words and the way they are used. The verse metaphorically compares the act of choosing harsh words when kind words are available, to the act of eating unripe fruits when ripe ones are available.\n\nThis Kural emphasizes the importance of choosing our words wisely. It suggests that when we have the opportunity to say something pleasant and agreeable, we should not ignore it and say something disagreeable instead. Similarly, when we have the chance to eat a ripe fruit, we shouldn't discard it and eat an unripe one instead. This is a metaphor for the unnecessary self-inflicted discomfort one might cause by choosing harsh words when kind ones could have been used.\n\nIn essence, this verse from Thiru Kural teaches us the importance of speaking kindly and agreeably, especially when we have the opportunity to do so. It serves as a timeless reminder that our words have the power to either soothe or hurt, and therefore, must be chosen and delivered thoughtfully..The kural verse:செய்யாமல் செய்த உதவிக்கு வையகமும்வானகமும் ஆற்றல் அரிது. ,translates to :Unhelped in turn good help given  Exceeds in worth earth and heaven,and it's explantion is :The Kural 101 emphasizes the immense value of unanticipated help. It states that even the combined wealth of heaven and earth cannot match the worth of assistance provided without any prior favor. This is the kind of help that is given without any expectation of return, often when it's least expected or most needed.\n\nThis verse underlines the principle of altruism and spontaneous generosity, a virtue highly esteemed in many cultures. It highlights the moral obligation to reciprocate such generosity, indicating that no material wealth can truly repay the value of such an act. It's a reminder that the most valuable gifts are not always tangible or material but often come in the form of kindness, help, and support. \n\nThe verse urges us to acknowledge and appreciate the rarity and preciousness of such altruistic help. It encourages us to strive to reciprocate not just in equal terms, but to exceed in our return, for the act of giving when nothing has been received is indeed an extraordinary act of kindness..The kural verse:காலத்தி னாற்செய்த நன்றி சிறிதெனினும்ஞாலத்தின் மாணப் பெரிது. ,translates to :A help rendered in hour of need  Though small is greater than the world,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse highlights the immense value of timely help or favor. It emphasizes that a small favor done at the right time, during a time of need, is much more valuable than its size or cost might suggest.\n\nThe verse implies that the true worth of a favor is not just found in its material or physical aspect, but in the timeliness and relevance it holds for the person receiving it. A small act of help during a time of great need can have an impact far greater than a large favor done when it's not needed as much.\n\nFor example, providing a glass of water to someone dying of thirst in a desert is a small act but its value is immeasurable for that individual at that time. In contrast, offering gallons of water to someone living next to a river may not hold the same value.\n\nThe verse further encourages us to be mindful of the needs of others and to offer help when it is most needed, regardless of the size or nature of the help. It also underlines that the receiver will remember the timely help for a long time, making it more valuable than anything else in the world.\n\nThe moral lesson here is that the value of any act of kindness is magnified when it's done at a critical time, teaching us the importance of empathy, understanding, and timely support in human relationships..The kural verse:பயன்தூக்கார் செய்த உதவி நயன்தூக்கின்நன்மை கடலின் பெரிது. ,translates to :Help rendered without weighing fruits  Outweighs the sea in grand effects,and it's explantion is :The Kural 103 emphasizes the immense value of selfless help or assistance provided to others. It suggests that when a favor or service is given without consideration of any personal benefits or returns, the worth of that act of kindness surpasses that of the vast sea. \n\nThis verse underscores the virtue of altruism, encouraging us to offer help without expecting anything in return. Such selfless acts of kindness are priceless and their value is immeasurable, akin to trying to compare their worth with the boundless sea.\n\nIn the cultural context of Tamil society, where this verse originates from, the sea is often used as a metaphor for something that is vast and immeasurable. Therefore, in this context, the verse suggests that the virtue of a selfless act is greater than the most enormous and incomparable entity known to man - the sea.\n\nIn a moralistic interpretation, this verse imparts the lesson that the true spirit of helping others lies not in the expectation of reciprocity, but in the sheer joy of giving. The value of such selfless acts of kindness is immense, surpassing even the largest physical entities. This verse thus promotes the virtues of generosity, kindness and selflessness..The kural verse:தினைத்துணை நன்றி செயினும் பனைத்துணையாக்கொள்வர் பயன்தெரி வார். ,translates to :Help given though millet-small  Knowers count its good palm-tree tall,and it's explantion is :Kural 104 emphasizes the value of gratitude and the importance of recognizing even the smallest acts of kindness. The verse metaphorically compares a small act of kindness (represented by a millet seed) to a large palmyra fruit, suggesting that those who truly understand the value of kindness will appreciate even the smallest good deed as if it were a substantial one. \n\nThis verse imparts a moral lesson that one should always acknowledge and appreciate the help and favors received, no matter how small they may seem. It encourages an attitude of gratitude and highlights its significance in human relationships. The verse also subtly suggests that those who understand the true worth of kindness are the ones who know how to repay it, implying a virtuous cycle of good deeds. \n\nThe use of 'millet seed' and 'palmyra fruit' is particularly poignant as it represents the smallest and largest entities in the Tamil cultural context, thus effectively conveying the message of the verse. \n\nIn essence, Kural 104 teaches us to appreciate and value every act of kindness, big or small, as it is the recognition and gratitude that truly amplifies the worth of the deed..The kural verse:உதவி வரைத்தன்று உதவி உதவிசெயப்பட்டார் சால்பின் வரைத்து. ,translates to :A help is not the help's measure  It is gainer's worth and pleasure,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 105, speaks about the nature and measure of benefaction. According to Valluvar, the real value of a favor or benefit does not lie simply in the act or its size, but rather in the worthiness and character of the person who receives it. \n\nIn other words, the measure of the favor is not necessarily the favor itself, but how it is valued and utilized by the receiver. A small help given to a righteous person who can appreciate and use it wisely might be of greater value than a large help given to someone who cannot appreciate or wisely use it.\n\nThis verse encourages us to consider the character and ability of the recipient when offering help. The true value of our help is determined not just by our action, but also by how it is received, appreciated, and utilized. Hence, a good deed's worth is maximized when it's rendered to the deserving..The kural verse:மறவற்க மாசற்றார் கேண்மை துறவற்கதுன்பத்துள் துப்பாயார் நட்பு. ,translates to :Forget not friendship of the pure  Forsake not timely helpers sure,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse emphasizes the importance of loyalty and gratitude in human relationships. It advises not to forget or forsake the friendship of those who stood by you in times of adversity, those who served as your support and strength when you were facing hardship. Such friends are invaluable, and their loyalty and assistance should not be taken lightly or forgotten once the hardship has passed.\n\nAdditionally, it underlines the necessity of remembering and valuing the benevolence of blameless individuals. These are the people who have acted with righteous conduct, without any flaws or faults, and have shown kindness and generosity. Their actions are driven by pure moral integrity, and such people should be respected and their benevolence should always be remembered.\n\nIn essence, this Kural verse teaches the importance of gratitude and loyalty in life, reminding us to be appreciative of those who help us during tough times and those who act with moral purity, and to never forget their support and kindness..The kural verse:எழுமை எழுபிறப்பும் உள்ளுவர் தங்கண்விழுமந் துடைத்தவர் நட்பு. ,translates to :Through sevenfold births, in memory fares  The willing friend who wiped one's tears,and it's explantion is :Kural 107 discusses the deep gratitude and appreciation of wise people towards those who have aided them in their time of distress or difficulty. It suggests that this gratitude is not just fleeting, but is remembered and cherished across what is poetically referred to as 'seven-fold births', a metaphorical representation of an infinite amount of time in Indian philosophical thought. \n\nThe verse emphasizes the value placed on acts of kindness and selflessness, suggesting that those who alleviate the sufferings of others create a lasting impact that transcends temporal boundaries. The term \"seven-fold births\" is a concept rooted in the belief of reincarnation, further emphasizing the timeless nature of such gratitude. \n\nIn essence, this verse teaches the virtue of gratitude and the importance of cherishing and remembering the help received during challenging times. It encourages us to acknowledge and appreciate the selfless acts of others, as these acts of kindness have a profound and lasting impact on our lives..The kural verse:நன்றி மறப்பது நன்றன்று நன்றல்லதுஅன்றே மறப்பது நன்று. ,translates to :To forget good turns is not good  Good it is over wrong not to brood,and it's explantion is :The Kural 108 emphasizes the virtues of gratitude and forgiveness. It proclaims that forgetting a favor or a good deed done to us is not virtuous; it is a breach of ethical conduct. We should always remember and appreciate the good done to us by others. This underlines the importance of gratitude in human relationships. \n\nOn the other hand, the verse also advises us to forget any harm or injury caused to us by others instantly. This highlights the value of forgiveness. The virtue of forgiveness promotes peace and harmony, and it prevents the cycle of revenge and resentment. \n\nThe simultaneous emphasis on remembering the good and forgetting the harm provides a balanced approach to life, promoting healthy relationships and a peaceful society. This principle of gratitude and forgiveness is not only relevant to personal relationships but also to broader social, political, and international relations. \n\nThus, in essence, this verse encourages us to appreciate and remember the good deeds of others while forgiving and forgetting their wrongdoings. This fosters goodwill, harmony, and unity among individuals and societies..The kural verse:கொன்றன்ன இன்னா செயினும் அவர்செய்தஒன்றுநன்று உள்ளக் கெடும். ,translates to :Let deadly harms be forgotten  While remembering one good-turn,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 109, emphasizes the profound impact of benevolence and kindness, even amidst grave harm or wrongdoing. \n\nThe verse essentially suggests that even if someone inflicts a severe injury or harm as grave as murder, that harm will dissipate in the face of a kind act or benefit that the same person had bestowed earlier. \n\nIn simpler terms, it means the memory of a good deed done for us by someone can overshadow the memory of a severe harm that the same person may have caused us later. The verse urges us to focus on the good done by a person rather than the harm, no matter how grave it is.\n\nThis Kural encapsulates the strength of positive actions and the power of gratitude. It teaches us the valuable lesson of forgiveness and the importance of focusing on the good deeds of a person, rather than their wrongdoings.\n\nIt is also a testament to the ancient Tamil wisdom that promotes peace, tolerance, and harmony in society. It upholds the belief that kindness and benevolence have the power to heal the deepest wounds and diffuse the most severe conflicts. \n\nRemembering a kind act can help us to overcome anger, resentment, and the desire for revenge, thus promoting a healthier and more peaceful existence..The kural verse:எந்நன்றி கொன்றார்க்கும் உய்வுண்டாம் உய்வில்லைசெய்ந்நன்றி கொன்ற மகற்கு. ,translates to :The virtue-killer may be saved  Not benefit-killer who is damned,and it's explantion is :The Kural 110 emphasizes the importance of gratitude and the severity of ingratitude. It states that a person who has disregarded every virtue can still find a way to exist, implying that they might find redemption or a path towards betterment. However, for a person who forgets a good deed done to them and acts ungratefully, there is no hope or redemption. The Kural underscores that ingratitude is one of the worst offenses one can commit, and it is more detrimental than the abandonment of all other virtues.\n\nThe cultural context here reflects the high value placed on gratitude in Tamil and Indian society in general. Remembering the good that others have done and repaying it in kind is considered a fundamental value, and the breach of this is seen as a significant moral failing. Therefore, the verse pushes for the cultivation of gratitude as a key virtue and warns against the harmful consequences of ingratitude..The kural verse:தகுதி எனவொன்று நன்றே பகுதியால்பாற்பட்டு ஒழுகப் பெறின். ,translates to :Equity is supreme virtue  It is to give each man his due,and it's explantion is :This Kural refers to the virtue of treating everyone equally, regardless of their status as friends, strangers, or enemies. It suggests that true nobility and morality are demonstrated by treating everyone with fairness and impartiality.\n\nThe verse implies that one should not be swayed by personal relationship or animosity in their dealings with others. Instead, they should maintain a balanced approach, treating everyone with the same level of respect and kindness. This equitable treatment should be extended to all, regardless of their relationship with us - be it our enemy who wishes harm upon us, strangers who have no direct impact on our lives, or friends who support and care for us.\n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes the importance of fairness and justice in our interactions with others. It suggests that this balanced approach is not just a virtue, but a pre-eminent one - a quality that stands above other moral values. It serves as a reminder that our actions and behaviors should not be influenced by personal biases or prejudices, but should be governed by principles of fairness and righteousness..The kural verse:செப்பம் உடையவன் ஆக்கஞ் சிதைவின்றிஎச்சத்திற் கேமாப்பு உடைத்து. ,translates to :Wealth of the man of equity  Grows and lasts to posterity,and it's explantion is :Kural 112 emphasizes the value of moral rectitude and its impact on wealth. The verse suggests that the wealth accumulated by a person who maintains integrity and moral balance will not only endure but also provide happiness and benefits to his future generations. This philosophy reflects a strong belief in karma and the moral law of cause and effect, where good deeds lead to good outcomes, and these outcomes extend beyond the individual to their progeny.\n\nThe verse underscores the belief that wealth earned through honest and upright means has a lasting value. It doesn't depreciate or perish, instead, it flourishes and extends its benefits to future generations. It carries an inherent blessing, acting like a protective shield, and providing sustained happiness and prosperity to the descendants of the upright individual.\n\nThus, the verse is a strong endorsement of ethical living, highlighting that wealth accumulated through righteousness is not only durable but also beneficial for many generations. It encourages individuals to lead a life of integrity, stating that such a life will ensure enduring wealth and happiness for their posterity..The kural verse:நன்றே தரினும் நடுவிகந்தாம் ஆக்கத்தைஅன்றே யொழிய விடல். ,translates to :Though profitable, turn away  From unjust gains without delay,and it's explantion is :Kural 113 explores the concept of ethics and integrity in the face of potential gain. It advises that even if a certain opportunity or action promises benefits, if it is not aligned with fairness and moral equilibrium, one should abandon it immediately.\n\nThe Kural underscores the importance of maintaining moral integrity and ethical conduct, regardless of the potential benefits an opportunity may bring. It essentially teaches that a true gain should not compromise one's values or principles. If an opportunity requires one to deviate from the path of righteousness, it is not considered a genuine or worthy gain.\n\nThe verse calls for the application of discernment in our dealings and acquisitions, emphasizing the significance of equity in all circumstances. This guidance is not just limited to material gains but applies to all aspects of life, including relationships, business, and personal conduct. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar insists on the need to prioritize righteousness over potential gains, as the long-term implications of maintaining our integrity far outweigh the short-term benefits that may come from unprincipled actions..The kural verse:தக்கார் தகவிலர் என்பது அவரவர்எச்சத்தாற் காணப்ப படும். ,translates to :The worthy and the unworthy  Are seen in their posterity,and it's explantion is :This Thirukkural, Kural 114, translates to \"The existence or absence of good offspring can often indicate whether a person is worthy or unworthy.\" It suggests that one's moral character and virtue can be judged by the nature of their offspring.\n\nThe Tamil explinations provide a similar perspective. They suggest that the discernment between a virtuous and a non-virtuous person can be made through the legacy they leave behind, which can include their wealth, their reputation, and especially the behavior and conduct of their children.\n\nIn essence, the verse emphasizes the belief that a person's moral and ethical values are often reflected in their children's conduct and character. This can be due to the influence of their upbringing, the values instilled in them, and the example set by their parents. Therefore, the presence of good offspring can be seen as the reflection of a person's worthiness and virtue, while the absence can indicate the opposite. \n\nHowever, it is also important to remember that this is a general observation and may not hold true in all cases. Each individual has their own free will and the ability to shape their own character, regardless of their upbringing..The kural verse:கேடும் பெருக்கமும் இல்லல்ல நெஞ்சத்துக்கோடாமை சான்றோர்க் கணி. ,translates to :Loss and gain by cause arise;  Equal mind adorns the wise,and it's explantion is :Kural 115 emphasizes the importance of maintaining equanimity of mind in both success and failure. It suggests that both loss and gain are not arbitrary but come due to specific causes. This is a universal truth of life - everyone experiences ups and downs, successes and failures. \n\nThe wise, however, are those who understand this nature of life and remain composed regardless of their circumstances. They neither get overly excited in times of gain nor do they succumb to despair in times of loss. This balanced state of mind is their distinguishing feature, their ornament. It’s what makes them admirable and respected. \n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse speaks to the philosophy of karma - the idea that our actions have inevitable consequences. It also alludes to the concept of detachment, a central tenet in many philosophical and spiritual traditions, which advocates for a balanced approach to life's highs and lows. \n\nIn a nutshell, this verse encourages us to be mindful of our mental state, to understand the transient nature of our circumstances, and to strive for a composed and balanced mindset, regardless of what life throws at us..The kural verse:கெடுவல்யான் என்பது அறிகதன் நெஞ்சம்நடுவொரீஇ அல்ல செயின். ,translates to :Of perdition let him be sure  Who leaves justice to sinful lure,and it's explantion is :Kural 116 emphasizes on the importance of equity and the consequences of deviating from it. The verse suggests that if an individual's heart strays from the path of fairness and indulges in sinful actions, he should introspect and realize that such actions would lead to his downfall. \n\nThe profound wisdom in this verse is the acknowledgment of personal responsibility for one's actions. It encourages self-awareness and self-regulation, hinting that one's moral compass should guide their actions. The verse also hints at the concept of karma, suggesting that sinful actions can lead to self-destruction.\n\nIn a broader context, this verse serves as a reminder that fairness and justice should be the guiding principles in all aspects of life. Whether it be personal decisions, professional dealings, or social interactions, straying from these principles can lead to destructive consequences.\n\nThe verse, therefore, urges individuals to always be mindful of their actions, maintain a sense of fairness, and stay away from wrongdoing. It emphasizes that the key to a prosperous and peaceful life lies in upholding justice and equity..The kural verse:கெடுவாக வையாது உலகம் நடுவாகநன்றிக்கண் தங்கியான் தாழ்வு. ,translates to :The just reduced to poverty  Is not held down by equity,and it's explantion is :Kural 117 emphasizes the high esteem in which the virtue of impartiality or equity is held. It suggests that a person who adheres strictly to the path of righteousness and maintains a balanced perspective in life, will never be considered lowly or poor, even if they lack material wealth. \n\nIn simple words, this verse states that the greatness of a person is not measured by their material wealth, but by their moral and ethical values. If a person lives in accordance with the principles of justice and fairness, society will respect and honor them, regardless of their financial status. \n\nThis Kural, therefore, encourages us to prioritize moral integrity and justice over materialistic gains. It teaches us that true wealth lies not in possessions but in good virtues, and a person who adheres to these virtues is truly rich and respected in society, irrespective of their financial situation. \n\nThe verse also serves as a reminder that poverty or wealth is not a determinant of a person's worth or status. Rather, it is one's adherence to the principles of righteousness and fairness that determines their true value in society. It encourages us to live a life of virtue, regardless of material circumstances. \n\nIn essence, Kural 117 is an affirmation of the enduring value of moral integrity and justice, and the importance of maintaining these virtues in the face of material poverty. It underscores the idea that wealth and poverty are transient and superficial, while virtues like justice and fairness are enduring and truly valuable..The kural verse:சமன்செய்து சீர்தூக்குங் கோல்போல் அமைந்தொருபால்கோடாமை சான்றோர்க் கணி. ,translates to :Like balance holding equal scales  A well poised mind is jewel of the wise,and it's explantion is :Kural 118 emphasizes the virtue of impartiality, especially in contexts that require judgment or decision making. It invokes the imagery of a perfectly balanced scale, which remains unbiased until a weight is placed on it. This analogy is used to describe the ideal behaviour of wise individuals, particularly those in positions of authority or power.\n\nThe Kural suggests that wisdom lies in the ability to maintain neutrality and not be swayed by prejudices or personal preferences. Just as a scale measures the weight of an object without bias, so should a wise person approach situations with an open and unbiased mind. \n\nThe verse asserts that maintaining this level of impartiality is an ornament of a truly wise person. The use of the term 'ornament' implies that unbiased judgement is not just a necessary quality, but also an adornment that enhances one's wisdom and respectability.\n\nIn essence, the verse encourages maintaining impartiality and fairness in all circumstances, irrespective of personal inclinations. It underscores the importance of neutrality in decision-making processes, emphasizing that true wisdom lies in the ability to remain unbiased and just..The kural verse:சொற்கோட்டம் இல்லது செப்பம் ஒருதலையாஉட்கோட்டம் இன்மை பெறின். ,translates to :Justice is upright, unbending  And free from crooked word-twisting,and it's explantion is :Kural 119 emphasizes the importance of integrity in speech and thought. It states that true rectitude or righteousness is reflected when there is a lack of deceit both in one's speech and in one's mind. The verse suggests that a person's words hold true value and justice only when they are free of bias, prejudice or ulterior motives, and this is possible only when the person's mind is free from these distortions as well. \n\nThis Kural thus advocates for consistency between one's thoughts and words, promoting transparency, honesty, and fairness. It essentially underlines the virtue of fairness or impartiality - to neither harbor nor express biased or prejudiced thoughts. It encourages individuals to maintain a clear conscience and speak truthfully, thereby embodying the principle of justice in every aspect of their lives. \n\nIn simpler terms, one's words should be a reflection of their thoughts and both should be devoid of any deceit or bias. This is the true embodiment of fairness and righteousness..The kural verse:வாணிகம் செய்வார்க்கு வாணிகம் பேணிப்பிறவும் தமபோல் செயின். ,translates to :A trader's trade prospers fairly  When his dealings are neighbourly,and it's explantion is :Kural 120 emphasizes the ethical conduct in business. The verse advises entrepreneurs and merchants to treat the goods and properties of others as if they were their own. It underscores the importance of honesty, integrity, and respect for other's belongings in trade.\n\nIn essence, this verse is a moral guideline for merchants, suggesting that they should guard and safeguard the interests of their clients or customers as they would protect their own. This principle is not only applicable to the realm of business but extends to all forms of transactions and interactions where the property or interests of others are entrusted to someone.\n\nIt emphasizes that a true merchant is not someone who merely engages in buying and selling goods for profit, but rather someone who upholds the principles of fairness, respect, and integrity in their dealings. It's this ethical conduct that truly distinguishes them as reputable and honorable merchants.\n\nThis verse also indirectly emphasizes the concept of trust in business relationships. When a merchant treats the goods of others as their own, it builds trust in the business relationship, which is a foundational element for any successful business.\n\nIn summary, Kural 120 encourages business practitioners to uphold ethical conduct, respect for other's property, and to foster trust in their professional relationships, portraying these attributes as the real essence of trade and commerce..The kural verse:அடக்கம் அமரருள் உய்க்கும் அடங்காமைஆரிருள் உய்த்து விடும். ,translates to :Self-rule leads to realms of gods  Indulgence leads to gloomy hades,and it's explantion is :The Thiru Kural verse 121 emphasizes the importance of self-control in one's life and its impact on one's spiritual journey. The verse states that exercising self-control can elevate an individual to the divine status, akin to the Gods. Here, being among the Gods can be interpreted as reaching a higher state of consciousness, purity, and virtue, where one is free from the earthly desires, malice, and negativity.\n\nOn the contrary, the absence of self-control can lead an individual into darkness, symbolically representing a state of ignorance, confusion, and suffering. This darkness could also be interpreted as the cycle of birth and death or the worldly miseries we face due to our uncontrolled desires and actions. The verse essentially underlines that self-control serves as a guiding light, leading us towards enlightenment, while the lack of it can trap us in the cycle of ignorance and suffering.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse is an ethical guide, advising individuals to exercise control over their senses and desires to lead a virtuous and fulfilling life. It implies that self-restraint is not just about suppressing one's desires, but it's about channeling them in the right direction for personal growth and spiritual enlightenment. The verse also subtly hints at the concept of karma, suggesting that our actions, guided by our self-control or lack thereof, determine our life's course and spiritual journey..The kural verse:காக்க பொருளா அடக்கத்தை ஆக்கம்அதனினூஉங் கில்லை உயிர்க்கு. ,translates to :No gains with self-control measure  Guard with care this great treasure,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural, penned by the revered Tamil philosopher Thiruvalluvar, advocates the importance of self-control and restraint in one's life. \n\nThe poet insists that self-control must be treated as a valuable asset, to be guarded and nurtured with utmost care. He unequivocally states that there is nothing else in the world that could bring greater benefits to a person than self-control. \n\nThis emphasis on self-control is rooted in the fact that it allows an individual to master their emotions, desires, and impulses, which in turn helps them lead a fulfilling and virtuous life. Through self-control, one can resist temptations, avoid hasty decisions, and prevent themselves from causing harm to themselves or others. \n\nIn other words, self-control is the key to maintaining one's integrity and dignity, and it lays the foundation for ethical conduct and moral living. It is a critical determinant of one's character and plays an instrumental role in shaping a person's destiny. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar in this Kural verse, underscores the supremacy of self-control over all other virtues and possessions, reiterating its pivotal role in human life and wellbeing..The kural verse:செறிவறிந்து சீர்மை பயக்கும் அறிவறிந்துஆற்றின் அடங்கப் பெறின். ,translates to :Knowing wisdom who lives controlled  Name and fame seek him untold,and it's explantion is :Kural 123 elucidates the importance of self-control and knowledge in attaining respect and distinction among the wise. The verse emphasizes that understanding the need for self-control is in itself a form of knowledge. Once a person gains this understanding, they should strive to exercise self-control in accordance with the moral and ethical principles they've learned. \n\nThe verse is essentially advising that one should not merely know what is right, but also actively practice it. This practice of self-restraint or self-control, when observed properly, will earn a person recognition and esteem among those who are wise and discerning. It highlights the value accorded to self-discipline and ethical behavior in society.\n\nThe Tamil explanations also concur on the same theme. They underline that understanding what needs to be known and acting with self-control as per that understanding, will be appreciated and respected by the virtuous people. Therefore, this verse advocates for the practice of self-control guided by proper knowledge, as a means to attain respect and distinction..The kural verse:நிலையின் திரியாது அடங்கியான் தோற்றம்மலையினும் மாணப் பெரிது. ,translates to :Firmly fixed in self serene  The sage looks grander than mountain,and it's explantion is :The Kural 124 emphasizes the virtues of self-control and steadfastness in one's chosen path or duty. It implies that the man who, without deviating from his moral and ethical obligations, can master self-restraint, is held in higher esteem than a mountain. The mountain here is a metaphor for a significant, immovable, and unchanging object. \n\nThe comparison to a mountain underlines the magnitude of this achievement. While a mountain may be physically imposing and unchanging, it lacks the capacity for moral and ethical reasoning that humans possess. Thus, a man who remains firm in his principles and self-control, despite the challenges and temptations he may encounter, attains a level of greatness that surpasses the grandeur of a mountain.\n\nThe verse underscores the importance of self-discipline and unwavering adherence to one's dharma or moral duty in the face of life's trials and tribulations. This in turn, elevates a man's stature in the eyes of society, making his greatness loftier than the highest mountain. It’s a call to inculcate self-restraint and steadfastness in one's life, which are considered higher virtues than physical strength or power..The kural verse:எல்லார்க்கும் நன்றாம் பணிதல் அவருள்ளும்செல்வர்க்கே செல்வம் தகைத்து. ,translates to :Humility is good for all  To the rich it adds a wealth special,and it's explantion is :The Kural 125 emphasizes the virtue of humility for all people, irrespective of their social or economic status. However, it specifically states that humility acquires an even more significant value when it is found in wealthy individuals.\n\nHumility is a virtue that brings goodness to everyone. It helps maintain harmony and respect in all relationships and interactions. The humble person is often respected and loved by others because of their modest behavior and lack of arrogance, regardless of their social status or wealth.\n\nHowever, when a rich person exhibits humility, it is seen as an additional wealth, beyond their material possessions. This is because wealth often brings with it a sense of superiority and pride, which can lead to arrogance and a lack of respect for others. When a rich person is humble, it signifies that they have not allowed their wealth to corrupt their character or values. They understand that their wealth does not make them superior to others and that they should treat everyone with equal respect and kindness.\n\nTherefore, this verse recognizes humility as a universal virtue but particularly appreciates it in the wealthy. It serves as a reminder that true wealth is not just about material possessions but also about possessing commendable character traits like humility..The kural verse:ஒருமையுள் ஆமைபோல் ஐந்தடக்கல் ஆற்றின்எழுமையும் ஏமாப் புடைத்து. ,translates to :Who senses five like tortoise hold  Their joy prolongs to births sevenfold,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse emphasizes the importance of self-restraint and control over one's senses. The verse likens an individual to a tortoise, which has the ability to retract its limbs and head within its shell for protection. Similarly, it suggests that if a person can control his five senses - sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch - in one lifetime, just as a tortoise does with its limbs, it will serve as a shield for him in his present life and the seven births to follow.\n\nThe five senses are the gateways to various desires and temptations. By exercising control and restraint over these senses, one can prevent themselves from succumbing to immoral actions and negative influences. This self-restraint is crucial in leading a virtuous life and achieving spiritual growth.\n\nIn the context of Hindu philosophy, the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth is a significant concept. The verse suggests that the benefits of such self-control are not just limited to this lifetime but extend to the future births, providing spiritual protection and moral fortitude.\n\nIn essence, the verse teaches us the importance of self-discipline, moral integrity, and the mastery over our senses as a means to lead a virtuous and honorable life, reaping benefits beyond the present life..The kural verse:யாகாவா ராயினும் நாகாக்க காவாக்கால்சோகாப்பர் சொல்லிழுக்குப் பட்டு. ,translates to :Rein the tongue if nothing else  Or slips of tongue bring all the woes,and it's explantion is :Kural 127 emphasizes the importance of guarding one's speech. It suggests that even if one fails to protect other aspects, it is critical to control and guard one's tongue. The tongue here symbolizes our speech and the words we utter. The essence of this verse lies in the belief that uncontrolled or irresponsible speech can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and even misery.\n\nThe verse warns us about the potential harm that our words can cause not just to others, but also to ourselves. Just as a physical wound can cause pain, words, once spoken, cannot be taken back and can lead to emotional pain and distress. The damage caused by words can sometimes be even more impactful and long-lasting than physical harm.\n\nIn a broader perspective, this Kural insists on the practice of thoughtful and responsible communication. It conveys the idea that we should think before we speak and make sure our words will not cause harm or discomfort to others. This timeless wisdom is especially relevant in today's world where words, both spoken and written, can easily be spread and can have significant consequences. \n\nIn summary, Thirukkural 127 serves as a gentle reminder of the power of words and the importance of using this power responsibly. It encourages us to guard our speech, as it has the potential to either build or break relationships, peace, and harmony..The kural verse:ஒன்றானுந் தீச்சொல் பொருட்பயன் உண்டாயின்நன்றாகா தாகி விடும். ,translates to :Even a single evil word  Will turn all good results to bad,and it's explantion is :The Kural 128 emphasizes the power and potential harm that can come from the spoken word. It suggests that if a person uses even one hurtful or malicious word, all the good they have done or spoken before can be overshadowed and tarnished. The Kural uses a comparison to a droplet of poison in a pot of milk to underline the ruinous effect of one bad word in a sea of good ones.\n\nThis verse underscores the importance of mindful speech. It reminds us that words can cause harm and thus, should be chosen with care. Even a single harmful word can lead to distress and might invalidate all the good deeds done by a person. \n\nIn the context of Tamil culture, this Kural highlights the strict moral code of conduct that values the power of words and encourages individuals to maintain decorum in speech. It instills the principle of 'harmlessness' in speech, which is an essential part of ethical living and social harmony. \n\nIn a broader interpretation, this verse serves as a universal guideline for ethical communication, underlining that good intentions and actions can be undermined by careless, harmful speech. Thus, the Kural encourages mindfulness in speech as a virtue and warns against the dire consequences of harmful words..The kural verse:தீயினாற் சுட்டபுண் உள்ளாறும் ஆறாதேநாவினாற் சுட்ட வடு. ,translates to :The fire-burnt wounds do find a cure  Tongue-burnt wound rests a running sore,and it's explantion is :The Thiru Kural verse 129 emphasizes the power and potential harm of words. \n\nIn this verse, Thiruvalluvar, the poet, makes a comparison between physical and emotional wounds. He states that a physical wound caused by fire might heal over time, even if it leaves a scar. The pain and the damage it causes are largely temporary and external. With time and appropriate treatment, it will eventually heal and may not cause persistent discomfort. \n\nHowever, the wounds inflicted by the tongue, representing harmful or harsh words, never truly heal. These wounds are internal, affecting one's emotions, thoughts, and mental well-being. The pain caused by derogatory words or harsh criticism can linger in the mind, causing prolonged distress and emotional scars. Unlike physical wounds, these emotional or psychological wounds cannot be treated with medicine and may not diminish over time. The pain could be relived every time the incident is remembered.\n\nThe verse highlights the importance of using words wisely and kindly. It calls for mindfulness in our speech, reminding us of the lasting impact our words can have on others. It encourages us to choose our words carefully to avoid causing unnecessary pain or harm. This aligns with the broader themes of morality, empathy and respect for others found throughout the Thiru Kural..The kural verse:கதங்காத்துக் கற்றடங்கல் ஆற்றுவான் செவ்விஅறம்பார்க்கும் ஆற்றின் நுழைந்து. ,translates to :Virtue seeks and peeps to see  Self-controlled savant anger free,and it's explantion is :Kural 130 emphasizes the importance of self-control, education, and the avoidance of anger. The verse highlights that a person who is well-versed in knowledge, who exercises self-restraint, and who maintains control over his anger, paves the way for virtue to enter his life.\n\nIn this kural, Thiruvalluvar uses the metaphor of virtue as a visitor who seeks an opportune moment to enter a person's life. This opportune moment is created when the individual cultivates the qualities of learning, self-control, and anger management. \n\nThe verse suggests that virtue is not a characteristic that one can attain easily, but is a result of conscientious self-improvement and self-discipline. Anger, often seen as a destructive emotion, can hinder the path of virtue. Thus, by learning to control one's anger and by equipping oneself with knowledge, one prepares the ground for virtue to flourish.\n\nIn a broader sense, the kural emphasizes that moral and ethical behavior is not a passive state, but requires active cultivation of positive attributes such as self-control, knowledge, and patience. This verse is a reminder that to achieve virtue, one must actively strive to eliminate negative traits and foster positive ones..The kural verse:ஒழுக்கம் விழுப்பந் தரலான் ஒழுக்கம்உயிரினும் ஓம்பப் படும். ,translates to :Decorum does one dignity  More than life guard its purity,and it's explantion is :Kural 131 emphasizes the paramount importance of 'Ozhukkam' (propriety or ethical conduct). According to the verse, such ethical conduct is the key to attaining eminence and respect in society. Therefore, it is so vital that it should be preserved and upheld even more carefully than one's life. \n\nThe essence of this verse lies in the belief that life without ethics or proper conduct is meaningless and devoid of value. Thus, the verse urges individuals to prioritize and cherish their ethical conduct, suggesting that it is even more crucial than life itself. This moral teaching is an essential part of Thiru Kural's wisdom, which consistently highlights the significance of righteousness and virtue in one's life. \n\nThis verse also reflects the ancient Tamil culture's emphasis on moral integrity and ethical behavior. It suggests that societal stature and respect are not merely determined by wealth or power, but primarily by one's moral and ethical conduct. This timeless wisdom remains relevant, serving as a guiding principle for ethical living in contemporary times..The kural verse:பரிந்தோம்பிக் காக்க ஒழுக்கம் தெரிந்தோம்பித்தேரினும் அஃதே துணை. ,translates to :Virtues of conduct all excel;  The soul aid should be guarded well,and it's explantion is :Kural 132 emphasizes the supreme importance of ethical conduct or 'Ozhukkam' in one's life. This verse advises that propriety of conduct must be diligently preserved and guarded. This is because, no matter how proficient one becomes in various virtues, it is this ethical conduct that serves as an exceptional support throughout one's life.\n\nThe Kural suggests that even if an individual is knowledgeable and excels in many virtues, if they lack ethical conduct, all their other virtues are diminished or undermined. Therefore, one should strive to maintain their ethical conduct under all circumstances, even in the face of adversity or hardship.\n\nIn essence, this verse underscores the concept that ethical conduct is not just one of many virtues, but the bedrock upon which all other virtues rest. It is the most reliable ally in life, guiding us through our actions and decisions. Thus, it is deemed vital to guard this conduct to ensure a righteous and fulfilling life..The kural verse:ஒழுக்கம் உடைமை குடிமை இழுக்கம்இழிந்த பிறப்பாய் விடும். ,translates to :Good conduct shows good family  Low manners mark anomaly,and it's explantion is :This Kural 133 emphasizes the importance of propriety of conduct, which is considered the true measure of one's birth or background. It suggests that true greatness or nobility of birth is not defined by one's lineage or wealth, but by one's ethical conduct and righteousness. \n\nThe verse further states that those who lack proper conduct, regardless of their high birth or affluent background, are deemed to have originated from a mean or lowly birth. This essentially means that their inappropriate behavior diminishes their social status and they are considered as having been born in a lower class, irrespective of their actual birth or lineage.\n\nOverall, this verse promotes the idea that moral and ethical conduct is of paramount importance and that it dictates one's true status in society. It underscores the concept that one's actions define one's character and social standing, rather than one's birth or lineage. It encourages individuals to uphold moral values and adhere to righteous conduct, emphasizing that failing to do so would lead to social degradation..The kural verse:மறப்பினும் ஓத்துக் கொளலாகும் பார்ப்பான்பிறப்பொழுக்கங் குன்றக் கெடும். ,translates to :Readers recall forgotten lore,  But conduct lost returns no more,and it's explantion is :The Kural 134 emphasizes on the virtue of right conduct over the knowledge acquired. The verse implies that a scholar, specifically a 'Brahman' referred to in the Kural, who has forgotten his learned scriptures (Vedas, in this context) can regain it by revisiting and re-reading them. However, if he fails in maintaining a dignified and moral conduct, which is expected from his birth and societal standing, then even his high birth or social status cannot save him from disgrace. The verse strongly advocates that it's not just knowledge, but the right conduct and character that uphold one's honor and dignity in society. This idea transcends time and applies to every individual regardless of their societal status. \n\nIn the cultural context, the 'Brahman' here stands as a metaphor for anyone who has acquired knowledge. The Vedas symbolize the knowledge one has gained. The verse is a timeless reminder that knowledge alone is not sufficient, but it should be complemented with virtuous conduct and ethical behavior. \n\nIn essence, Thiru Kural-134 delivers a profound message that moral conduct holds higher value than mere acquisition of knowledge, and the lack of it can lead to the downfall of even those from the highest strata of society..The kural verse:அழுக்கா றுடையான்கண் ஆக்கம்போன்று இல்லைஒழுக்க மிலான்கண் உயர்வு. ,translates to :The envious prosper but ill  The ill-behaved sinks lower still,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural is an insightful commentary on the importance of virtue and proper conduct in achieving greatness. \n\nThe first half of the verse discusses envy, a negative emotion that arises from desiring what others have. The verse asserts that an envious person will not have wealth. This can be understood in two ways: firstly, an envious person is always focused on what others have, rather than cultivating their own abilities and resources, leading to a lack of personal growth and prosperity. Secondly, envy tarnishes a person's character, making them unattractive to opportunities and relationships that can bring wealth.\n\nThe second half of the verse states that a person lacking in 'ozhukkam' or propriety of conduct will not achieve greatness. Propriety of conduct includes virtues such as honesty, respect for others, responsibility, and adherence to moral and ethical standards. When these virtues are absent, it is impossible for a person to rise to true greatness because they lack the moral foundation that earns respect and influence. \n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes that character, virtue, and proper conduct are the real wealth and the key to true greatness. Without these, material wealth and status are meaningless and unattainable..The kural verse:ஒழுக்கத்தின் ஒல்கார் உரவோர் இழுக்கத்தின்ஏதம் படுபாக் கறிந்து. ,translates to :The firm from virtue falter not  They know the ills of evil thought,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukural emphasizes the importance of upholding one's moral conduct and propriety in life, no matter how challenging the circumstances may be. The verse suggests that those who are steadfast in their mind and principles will not allow their moral conduct to falter. They understand the consequences of deviating from the path of righteousness and propriety, recognizing the misery and degradation that can result from such transgressions.\n\nThe verse also highlights the significance of mental strength and determination in adhering to moral conduct. It suggests that it is the strength of one's mind that prevents one from slipping into immoral or improper behavior. Such individuals have a deep understanding of the causal relationship between action and consequence and therefore, they stand firm in their principles, regardless of the hardships they might encounter.\n\nIn a broader context, the verse teaches us the value of ethical living and maintaining our personal integrity. It reminds us that every action has a consequence and therefore, we should always strive to act in a way that is morally correct and socially acceptable. This not only brings peace and harmony in our lives but also prevents the onset of unnecessary suffering and regret..The kural verse:ஒழுக்கத்தின் எய்துவர் மேன்மை இழுக்கத்தின்எய்துவர் எய்தாப் பழி. ,translates to :Conduct good ennobles man,  Bad conduct entails disgrace mean,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural emphasizes the importance of good conduct and the consequences of impropriety. It suggests that maintaining righteousness and good behavior in all aspects of life leads one to acquire respect, status, and honor. This could encompass everything from personal integrity, honesty, kindness to respect for others and adherence to ethical norms.\n\nOn the contrary, the verse warns that those who behave improperly, displaying disrespect, dishonesty or unethical actions, will inevitably face disgrace. The 'insufferable disgrace' can be perceived as social disapproval, loss of respect, or even punitive consequences. This disgrace is often more difficult to bear than material losses.\n\nThis kural, hence, advises the reader to maintain good behavior and ethical conduct not just for personal growth and respect but also to avoid the unpleasant consequences of impropriety. It thus brings out the intrinsic link between one's actions and their resulting consequences, a concept often found in many philosophies and religions..The kural verse:நன்றிக்கு வித்தாகும் நல்லொழுக்கம் தீயொழுக்கம்என்றும் இடும்பை தரும். ,translates to :Good conduct sows seeds of blessings  Bad conduct endless evil brings,and it's explantion is :This Kural (Verse 138) emphasizes the profound role of good conduct in life. It asserts that noble behavior serves as the root of all virtues, illuminating one's life with positivity and prosperity. If one conducts themselves with righteousness, they sow the seeds of virtue that will bear the fruits of peace, happiness, and respect in society. \n\nOn the contrary, the verse warns about the consequences of impropriety or bad conduct. It states that negative or immoral behavior consistently brings about suffering and sorrow. Such conduct not only affects the individual but also distresses the society they live in. Our actions, whether good or bad, have a ripple effect and hence, this verse stresses the importance of maintaining propriety in our behavior. \n\nIn essence, this verse is a timeless reminder that our character is defined by our conduct, and it is our moral responsibility to adhere to good conduct for a virtuous and fulfilling life. Consequently, the way we conduct ourselves shapes our destiny, either filling it with joy through good actions or leading to perpetual suffering through bad actions..The kural verse:ஒழுக்க முடையவர்க்கு ஒல்லாவே தீயவழுக்கியும் வாயாற் சொலல். ,translates to :Foul words will never fall from lips  Of righteous men even by slips,and it's explantion is :Kural 139 emphasizes the virtue of propriety in one's speech. The verse suggests that those who truly understand and embody the principles of good conduct or 'ozhukkam' (in Tamil) will not speak ill or negatively, even by mistake or in a moment of forgetfulness. Such individuals are so deeply ingrained with the principles of righteousness that their words naturally align with their virtuous conduct. \n\nThe verse underscores the importance of not just controlling one's actions, but also one's words, as they carry immense power and can have significant impact on others. This verse encourages us to be mindful of our speech, to ensure that our words reflect respect, kindness, and goodwill, even when we are caught off guard or in a state of forgetfulness.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse teaches us that good conduct is not a switch we turn on and off when convenient, but a constant state of being that permeates all aspects of our life, including our speech. It's a reminder that our words are a mirror to our character and values, and thus, we should strive to speak only what is true, kind, and beneficial..The kural verse:உலகத்தோடு ஒட்ட ஒழுகல் பலகற்றும்கல்லார் அறிவிலா தார் ,translates to :Though read much they are ignorant  Whose life is not world-accordant,and it's explantion is :Kural 140 emphasizes the importance of social harmony and the ability to navigate the world with grace and understanding. The verse suggests that true knowledge is not merely about academic learning or mastery over numerous subjects. Instead, it is about the wisdom and capability to live in harmony with the world, respecting societal norms and adapting to the world's ways.\n\nThe verse points out that those who may have learned many things but have not learned how to live in accordance with the world are still ignorant. This is because they fail to understand the fundamental dynamics of coexistence and societal interaction, which are as essential as any academic knowledge.\n\nIn other words, the verse advocates the importance of practical wisdom and social intelligence. It encourages individuals to learn the art of living harmoniously with others, which is as valuable as any formal education. It suggests that those who fail to acquire this basic skill of life remain ignorant, despite their academic accomplishments or extensive knowledge in various fields. \n\nIt is a reminder that learning should not be confined to books and theories. Instead, it should extend to understanding the world, respecting diversity, and practicing empathy and tolerance, which are the cornerstones of a harmonious and enlightened life..The kural verse:பிறன்பொருளாள் பெட்டொழுகும் பேதைமை ஞாலத்துஅறம்பொருள் கண்டார்கண் இல். ,translates to :Who know the wealth and virtue's way  After other's wife do not stray,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse 141 from the Thirukkural, a classic Tamil text, addresses the ethical issue of desiring someone who belongs to another person. The verse suggests that such a desire represents ignorance and is a sign of a lack of understanding of both virtue and property rights.\n\nIn the context of this verse, \"virtue\" refers to moral standards and ethical behavior, including respect for the rights and relationships of others. \"Property\" here refers to personal ownership and rights, in this case, the exclusive emotional and physical rights one person has over their spouse. To desire someone else's spouse, then, is to disregard these fundamental principles of virtue and property rights.\n\nThose who comprehend and respect these aspects, according to the verse, do not entertain such desires. It implies that a deep understanding of morality and the rights of ownership inherently deters a person from such unethical yearnings.\n\nIn brief, this verse emphasizes the importance of respect for others' relationships and possessions, which is central to societal harmony and personal integrity. It criticizes and discourages the act of coveting what rightfully belongs to someone else, particularly their spouse..The kural verse:அறன்கடை நின்றாருள் எல்லாம் பிறன்கடைநின்றாரின் பேதையார் இல். ,translates to :He is the worst law breaking boor  Who haunts around his neighbour's door,and it's explantion is :The verse 142 from Thiru Kural emphasizes the sanctity of marital bonds and the disgrace associated with intruding into other's marital life. \n\nIn this verse, Valluvar, the poet, first refers to those who have strayed from the path of righteousness (dharma or virtue) and have indulged in immoral ways. Among these people, he asserts that there are no greater fools than those who covet another's spouse and stand outside their neighbor's door with ill intentions. This act is seen as the worst form of immorality.\n\nThe poet uses the metaphor of 'standing outside the door' to represent the intrusion into another's marital life, highlighting the disgrace and foolishness associated with it. It's a severe breach of trust, respect, and societal norms. \n\nThe verse is a stern moral warning against adultery, emphasizing the importance of maintaining personal integrity and respecting the sanctity of others' relationships. The poet strongly condemns such behavior and portrays it as the lowest form of moral degradation. \n\nTherefore, the verse is not only about moral conduct but also about social ethics, personal integrity, and respect for others' personal lives..The kural verse:விளிந்தாரின் வேறல்லர் மன்ற தெளிந்தாரில்தீமை புரிந்து ஒழுகு வார். ,translates to :The vile are dead who evil aim  And put faithful friends' wives to shame,and it's explantion is :Kural 143 essentially highlights the importance of fidelity and respect in relationships, particularly towards the spouse of a trusted friend or associate. \n\nThe verse states that those who harbor inappropriate desires or intentions towards the wife of a man who trusts them are no better than the dead, even though they are alive. Their existence is compared to the lifeless, indicating that such behavior is morally corrupt and devoid of human values. \n\nThe underlying concept here is the sanctity of marital relationships and trust. Betraying someone's trust, especially in such a personal and intimate context, is considered one of the most severe moral transgressions. This verse emphasizes the importance of respecting the boundaries of relationships and maintaining the trust that others have placed in us. \n\nIn a broader sense, this Kural is a reminder to uphold our moral and ethical responsibilities towards others, especially those who trust us and consider us worthy of their friendship and respect..The kural verse:எனைத்துணையர் ஆயினும் என்னாம் தினைத்துணையும்தேரான் பிறனில் புகல். ,translates to :Their boasted greatness means nothing  When to another's wife they cling,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural emphasizes the importance of moral integrity and respect for the sanctity of marital relationships. It warns against the detrimental effects of lustful desires towards another man's wife, stating that no matter how great or influential one might be, such actions only lead to disgrace and loss of respect. \n\nThe verse underscores that the allure towards another's spouse, without considering the moral implications, even minutely, can lead to severe consequences. It points out that one's greatness or status doesn't provide an excuse or shield from the guilt and disgrace associated with such an act. Thus, the verse promotes the virtues of self-restraint, respect for others' relationships, and the adherence to moral and ethical standards in one's personal life. \n\nIt is a powerful reminder that personal integrity and respect for others are fundamental to maintaining one's honor and reputation, regardless of their status or position in society. It also implicitly highlights that societal norms and ethical values should guide one's actions, particularly in matters relating to personal relationships..The kural verse:எளிதென இல்லிறப்பான் எய்துமெஞ் ஞான்றும்விளியாது நிற்கும் பழி. ,translates to :Who trifles with another's wife  His guilty stain will last for life,and it's explantion is :The verse 145 of Thiru Kural strongly condemns the act of illicit relations, particularly focusing on a man who considers engaging in a relationship with another man's wife. The verse emphasizes that such a man, who lightly thinks of committing such a grave mistake, will be burdened with a guilt that will persist imperishably and eternally.\n\nThis verse brings forth the timeless moral principle of fidelity and respect for the sanctity of marriage. It underlines the gravity of infidelity and the lasting implications it can have on the wrongdoer. The guilt mentioned is not just a passing emotion, but a permanent stain on one's ethical standing, which cannot be wiped away, symbolizing the severe consequences for such actions.\n\nThiruvalluvar, through this verse, encourages the principle of respect for others' relationships and emphasizes maintaining moral integrity. It serves as a warning against succumbing to momentary temptations and underscores the importance of self-restraint, respect for the marital bond, and ethical conduct. \n\nEven though it's written centuries ago, this principle remains relevant today, underlining the universal and timeless nature of Thiruvalluvar's teachings..The kural verse:பகைபாவம் அச்சம் பழியென நான்கும்இகவாவாம் இல்லிறப்பான் கண். ,translates to :Hatred, sin, fear, and shame-these four  Stain adulterers ever more,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the moral and ethical implications of engaging in an adulterous act. The verse explains that the man who becomes intimately involved with another's wife will be forever haunted by four consequences: hatred, sin, fear, and disgrace.\n\n\"Hatred\" suggests the animosity that he will earn from others, especially the husband of the woman. \"Sin\" refers to the moral and religious transgression he commits, as most ethical and spiritual doctrines consider adultery a severe offense. \"Fear\" alludes to the constant apprehension he would live under, the fear of being discovered and the subsequent ramifications. Lastly, \"disgrace\" denotes the loss of respect and esteem in his community and society, a stigma that is hard to erase.\n\nTherefore, the verse serves as a stern warning against adultery, underlining the dire personal and social consequences one has to face for such an act. It instigates people to adhere to moral principles and uphold the sanctity of relationships. This verse is not only a reflection of the societal norms of the time it was written but also remains relevant today..The kural verse:அறனியலான் இல்வாழ்வான் என்பான் பிறனியலாள்பெண்மை நயவா தவன். ,translates to :He is the righteous householder  His neighbour's wife who covets never,and it's explantion is :The Kural 147 emphasizes the virtue of respecting other's marital relationships and not desiring another man's wife. The verse states that a man who refrains from desiring the womanhood of another man's wife, who is rightfully his, is considered to be a truly virtuous householder. This verse is a testament to Thiruvalluvar's moral stance on preserving the sanctity of marriage and fostering mutual respect among individuals in society.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse underlines the importance of faithfulness in relationships, respect for the boundaries of others, and the adherence to moral values. It implies that such restraint and respect not only establish one as a virtuous individual but also contribute to social harmony and personal dignity.\n\nThe cultural context of this verse is rooted in the traditional societal values of Tamil Nadu, where Thiruvalluvar composed the Thiru Kural. These values emphasize the importance of marital fidelity and respect for other's relationships..The kural verse:பிறன்மனை நோக்காத பேராண்மை சான்றோர்க்குஅறனொன்றோ ஆன்ற வொழுக்கு. ,translates to :They lead a high-souled manly life  The pure who eye not another's wife,and it's explantion is :This Kural 148, from the Book of Virtue in Thirukkural, emphasizes the importance of self-restraint and respect for others' relationships in the context of marital fidelity. It states that the supreme form of manliness or virtue is not to covet another person's wife. This is not only considered a moral obligation but also stands as the pinnacle of righteous conduct.\n\nThe verse underscores the significance of restraint in our lives, particularly in matters concerning personal relationships. It highlights that one's nobility and grace are not just reflected in strength or power, but also in the control of one's desires and respect for others' personal boundaries. It also stresses that respect for another man's wife is not just a matter of personal virtue, but it also contributes to social harmony, peace, and respect among individuals.\n\nIn essence, this kural preaches that the highest form of ethical conduct and manliness lies in respecting the sanctity of another person's marital relationship. This is not just a moral duty, but also a mark of a truly great and dignified individual..The kural verse:நலக்குரியார் யாரெனின் நாமநீர் வைப்பின்பிறர்க்குரியாள் தோள்தோயா தார். ,translates to :Good in storm bound earth is with those  Who clasp not arms of another's spouse,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse, Kural 149, explores the theme of moral conduct, specifically in the context of fidelity and respect for the relationships of others. It is a direct commentary on the importance of refraining from inappropriate interactions with someone else's spouse.\n\nThe verse asks, 'Who are the people who will attain goodness in this world, which is surrounded by the expansive, fear-inducing ocean?' The response given is, 'Those who do not touch the shoulder of a woman who belongs to another man.' Here, ‘touching the shoulder’ serves as a metaphor for engaging in any form of inappropriate, intimate conduct.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that moral integrity, respect for the sanctity of marriage, and refraining from causing harm to others, especially in their personal relationships, are essential for a person's good standing in the world. It suggests that those who uphold such ethical standards will be rewarded with goodness in this life.\n\nIn the societal and cultural context of ancient Tamil society when Thiru Kural was written, marriage was considered sacred, and fidelity was highly valued. This verse is a reflection of those societal norms, and it continues to hold relevance today by reinforcing the universal values of respect for others and their relationships..The kural verse:அறன்வரையான் அல்ல செயினும் பிறன்வரையாள்பெண்மை நயவாமை நன்று. ,translates to :Sinners breaking virtue's behest  Lust not for another's wife at least,and it's explantion is :The Kural 150 delves into the theme of moral integrity, particularly in the context of respecting the boundaries of others. It states that even if a man doesn't perform virtuous deeds and indulges in vices, it is still considered commendable if he refrains from desiring another man's wife. \n\nThe verse emphasizes the significance of respecting the sanctity of others' relationships and the importance of fidelity. Desire for another's spouse is viewed as a grave misdeed, which could lead to chaos and disharmony in society. It is considered an act of disrespect not only towards the other man but also towards the woman. \n\nThe verse also subtly underlines the idea that a man's character is not just defined by his virtues but also by his ability to control his desires and respect others' rights and boundaries. Even in the absence of other virtuous deeds, this single act of self-restraint is seen as a significant merit. \n\nIn essence, this Kural emphasizes the importance of self-control, respect for the sanctity of marriage, and the preservation of social harmony. It promotes the idea that refraining from causing harm to others is a virtue in itself, even if one does not actively engage in other virtuous deeds..The kural verse:அகழ்வாரைத் தாங்கும் நிலம்போலத் தம்மைஇகழ்வார்ப் பொறுத்தல் தலை. ,translates to :As earth bears up with diggers too  To bear revilers is prime virtue,and it's explantion is :This Kural, number 151, is a profound verse that discusses the virtue of forbearance. It uses the metaphor of the earth to exemplify this quality. The earth, regardless of how much it is dug and exploited, continues to support and bear the weight of the very beings who exploit it. In the same way, the verse suggests that it's a virtuous act to tolerate those who criticize or belittle us. \n\nThis tolerance doesn't just mean to silently endure the insults, but also to remain kind and respectful towards these individuals. This mirrors the earth's unchanging support regardless of the harm inflicted upon it. This verse implies that the ability to remain unswayed, patient and forgiving in the face of insult or harm is the foremost of virtues. \n\nMoreover, the Kural also subtly suggests the impermanence of verbal insults, just like the temporary holes we dig on the earth that eventually get filled. Thus, it encourages us not to hold grudges and to let go of negativity, leading to peace and harmony. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar places the virtue of forbearance as the ultimate quality, comparing it to the earth, a symbol of patience and resilience..The kural verse:பொறுத்தல் இறப்பினை என்றும் அதனைமறத்தல் அதனினும் நன்று. ,translates to :Forgive insults is a good habit  Better it is to forget it,and it's explantion is :Kural 152 emphasizes the virtues of patience and forgiveness. It advises that when one is faced with an insult or a wrongdoing, the best course of action is not to retaliate, even if one is capable of doing so. This demonstrates the strength and nobility of one's character, as it takes immense self-restraint and moral courage to avoid the impulse of tit-for-tat. \n\nHowever, the verse goes a step further by stating that simply tolerating the offense is not enough. It encourages one to completely forget the offense, to erase it from their memory. This is considered an even higher virtue than bearing with the offense. \n\nThe rationale behind this advice is that holding onto the memory of the offense can lead to resentment and bitterness, which can poison one's mind and heart over time. By completely forgetting the offense, one frees themselves from these negative emotions and maintains their inner peace and happiness. \n\nIn a broader societal context, this practice of forgiveness and forgetting promotes harmony and reduces conflict, as it prevents the perpetuation of revenge and hostility. \n\nIn summary, this verse is a profound teaching on the power of forgiveness, encouraging us to not only tolerate but also forget the wrongs done to us, for our own peace and well-being as well as for the overall health of our relationships and communities..The kural verse:இன்மையுள் இன்மை விருந்தொரால் வன்மையுள்வன்மை மடவார்ப் பொறை. ,translates to :Neglect the guest is dearth of dearth  To bear with fools is strength of strength,and it's explantion is :Kural 153 dives into the realms of hospitality and patience, two important virtues in traditional Tamil culture. The verse suggests that the worst form of poverty isn't just a lack of wealth, but a lack of generosity and hospitality. It is considered particularly poor form to turn away a guest or refuse to offer hospitality, regardless of one's own financial situation. \n\nThe second half of the verse suggests that the greatest show of strength isn't physical might, but the ability to remain patient and tolerant in the face of ignorance. This could refer to both dealing with ignorant people and also forgiving those who may have wronged you out of their own lack of understanding. \n\nIn essence, this Kural encapsulates the values of hospitality and forbearance, emphasizing that true wealth and strength are measured not in material terms but in one's capacity to be generous, patient, and understanding..The kural verse:நிறையுடைமை நீங்காமை வேண்டின் பொற்யுடைமைபோற்றி யொழுகப் படும். ,translates to :Practice of patient quality  Retains intact itegrity,and it's explantion is :Kural 154 emphasizes the importance of patience as a virtue for achieving and maintaining greatness. The verse suggests that if one wishes to sustain an abundance of virtues, to be seen as a person of great character, and maintain this status without it diminishing, one must exercise and prioritize patience in their conduct. \n\nPatience is seen as a guiding principle that helps in maintaining a balanced and virtuous life. It is not just about calmly waiting, but also about understanding the situation, accepting it, and working diligently until the situation improves. Patience prevents hasty decisions, impulsive reactions, and regrettable actions. It enables one to make wiser decisions, thereby enhancing one's reputation and character.\n\nIn essence, this verse is a reminder that greatness is not merely a result of wealth, power, or intelligence, but of patience, which can guide us in our actions and reactions, enabling us to maintain our virtues, dignity, and greatness. It suggests that the world respects and admires those who are patient, as patience signifies maturity, understanding, and control over one's emotions..The kural verse:ஒறுத்தாரை ஒன்றாக வையாரே வைப்பர்பொறுத்தாரைப் பொன்போற் பொதிந்து. ,translates to :Vengeance is not in esteem held  Patience is praised as hidden gold,and it's explantion is :Kural 155 discusses the virtues of patience and the lack of appreciation for the resentful. It suggests that those who are patient, even in the face of harm or insult, are highly valued by the wise, much like gold is valued and stored carefully. On the other hand, those who react with anger and resentment are not esteemed at all.\n\nIn essence, the verse emphasizes the importance of patience and forbearance. It suggests that those who can endure wrongdoings without seeking revenge or harboring resentment are worthy of admiration. This virtue is compared to gold, which is treasured and kept safe for its value, implying that patience is a valuable quality to possess.\n\nContrarily, those who are quick to anger and seek revenge are not held in high regard. They are seen as less valuable, and their actions are not appreciated by the wise. Their lack of patience and tendency towards vengeance diminishes their worth in the eyes of others.\n\nTherefore, this Kural teaches us to cultivate patience and forbearance, to respond to harm or insult with understanding rather than anger, and to value these qualities in ourselves and others, much like we value gold..The kural verse:ஒறுத்தார்க்கு ஒருநாளை இன்பம் பொறுத்தார்க்குப்பொன்றுந் துணையும் புகழ். ,translates to :Revenge accords but one day's joy  Patience carries its praise for aye,and it's explantion is :This Kural, number 156, emphasizes the virtue of patience and forgiveness. It contrasts the fleeting satisfaction that might come from retaliating against those who harm us, with the enduring praise and respect that accompanies tolerance and forbearance.\n\nThe first half says, \"The pleasure of the resentful continues for a day.\" This refers to the temporary satisfaction or relief one might feel after retaliating or taking revenge against someone who has caused harm or offense. But this pleasure is short-lived, lasting only for a day, symbolizing its transient nature.\n\nThe second half of the verse states, \"The praise of the patient will continue until (the final destruction of) the world.\" This highlights the enduring nature of patience and forgiveness. When one chooses to forgo revenge and instead forgives, they are rewarded with lasting praise and respect. This praise endures \"until the final destruction of the world,\" indicating its permanence.\n\nIn essence, this verse advises against seeking immediate, short-term satisfaction through retaliation. Instead, it encourages patience and forgiveness, virtues that earn enduring respect and praise. It reminds us that the act of forgiveness not only helps maintain social harmony but also enhances one's own moral stature..The kural verse:திறனல்ல தற்பிறர் செய்யினும் நோநொந்துஅறனல்ல செய்யாமை நன்று. ,translates to :Though others cause you wanton pain  Grieve not; from unjust harm refrain,and it's explantion is :Kural 157 emphasizes the principles of compassion, virtue, and non-retaliation even in the face of adversities. In this couplet, Thiruvalluvar advises that even if others cause harm or inflict injuries upon you, it is best not to respond with similar actions out of compassion. This is because, by reciprocating harm, you are not only deviating from virtue, but you're also adding to the cycle of pain and suffering.\n\nThe verse suggests that one should empathize with the wrongdoers, understanding that they would eventually face the consequences of their actions. Instead of seeking revenge, one should adhere to the path of righteousness and virtue. This approach not only prevents you from acquiring bad karma, but also sets a moral standard for others to follow. \n\nIn essence, the couplet teaches us to uphold the principles of virtue and compassion, even when confronted with malicious actions or harm. It encourages us to break the cycle of retaliation and revenge, and instead lead by the example of patience, understanding, and kindness..The kural verse:மிகுதியான் மிக்கவை செய்தாரைத் தாந்தம்தகுதியான் வென்று விடல். ,translates to :By noble forbearance vanquish  The proud that have caused you anguish,and it's explantion is :Kural 158 emphasizes the power of patience in dealing with individuals who act out of pride and commit excessive wrongdoings. The verse suggests that instead of retaliating or responding with a similar attitude, one should practice patience and endurance. \n\nThis approach is recommended for two primary reasons. Firstly, it prevents the perpetuation of conflict, and secondly, it often leads to the transformation of the offending individual, who may feel humbled or challenged by the patience of the person they have wronged. \n\nThe verse underlines the core tenets of Thirukural, which advocate for a peaceful approach to conflict resolution, rooted in patience and moral integrity. Through this, it suggests a higher path of moral victory over physical or verbal retaliation. \n\nIn essence, this Kural advises us to win over people who commit wrongdoings out of arrogance, not by stooping to their level, but by rising above with the power of our patience and virtue. This is a testament to the transformative power of patience and the ultimate victory of righteousness over wrongdoing..The kural verse:துறந்தாரின் தூய்மை உடையர் இறந்தார்வாய்இன்னாச்சொல் நோற்கிற் பவர். ,translates to :More than ascetics they are pure  Who bitter tongues meekly endure,and it's explantion is :The Thiru Kural verse 159 extols the virtue of patience and forbearance. It states: \"Those who bear with the uncourteous speech of the insolent are as pure as the ascetics.\"\n\nThe verse suggests that the strength and purity of a person's character are not solely determined by their external actions, but also by their internal fortitude. It implies the highest form of purity and moral strength is exhibited by those who can endure harsh words or offensive behavior from others without losing their composure.\n\nIn the same way that ascetics renounce worldly pleasures and maintain their purity through discipline and self-control, those who can ignore or forgive the unkind words of others demonstrate a similar level of purity and strength. They do not allow themselves to be tainted by negativity or provoked into inappropriate responses.\n\nThis verse encourages us to maintain our dignity and moral integrity in the face of adversity, demonstrating the same strength of character as ascetics who resist worldly temptations. It reminds us that true strength lies in the ability to remain calm, composed and forgiving, even when faced with the most challenging situations. \n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes the virtues of tolerance and emotional resilience, and the importance of maintaining our moral purity, regardless of the circumstances we face..The kural verse:உண்ணாது நோற்பார் பெரியர் பிறர்சொல்லும்இன்னாச்சொல் நோற்பாரின் பின். ,translates to :Who fast are great to do penance  Greater are they who bear offence,and it's explantion is :The Kural 160 emphasizes the virtues of patience and endurance, particularly in the face of harsh or negative speech from others. The verse states that those who can abstain from retaliation and maintain composure when confronted with offensive words are regarded highly, even more so than those who practice abstinence from food.\n\nAbstaining from food, often practiced in many cultures as a form of penance or self-discipline, is indeed a commendable act of self-control. However, the verse places a higher value on the ability to endure harsh words from others, as it requires a greater degree of emotional control and maturity. This practice of patience and restraint is a demonstration of an individual's strength of character.\n\nIn essence, the verse suggests that while physical discipline (like fasting) is admirable, it is the emotional and mental discipline (like enduring harsh words without retaliation) that truly highlights a person's greatness. This reflects the broader theme in Thiru Kural of advocating for virtues that promote harmony and peace in society..The kural verse:ஒழுக்காறாக் கொள்க ஒருவன்தன் நெஞ்சத்துஅழுக்காறு இலாத இயல்பு. ,translates to :Deem your heart as virtuous  When your nature is not jealous,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse advocates for a mentality free of envy, advising one to regard such a disposition as highly as moral and ethical conduct. The verse emphasizes that refraining from envy should be an innate characteristic of an individual, just like adhering to proper conduct and ethics. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, the author, is encouraging individuals to cultivate a mindset that does not harbor envy or resentment towards others' success or prosperity. He suggests that this kind of mental discipline is as important as maintaining good conduct. By doing so, individuals can lead a peaceful and harmonious life, fostering goodwill and understanding among each other. \n\nThe cultural context here underlines the importance of inner virtues in Tamil society, where qualities like envy-free mind are placed on par with external behavior reflecting one's character. This verse is a call for internal self-improvement, asserting that a person's true character is reflected not just in their actions, but also in their thoughts and feelings. Thus, a truly virtuous person should be free from envy in both thought and deed..The kural verse:விழுப்பேற்றின் அஃதொப்பது இல்லையார் மாட்டும்அழுக்காற்றின் அன்மை பெறின். ,translates to :No excellence excels the one  That by nature envies none,and it's explantion is :Kural 162 emphasizes the virtue of being free from envy. The verse suggests that among all the admirable traits that one can possess, there is none that is as superior or beneficial as the ability to not harbor envy towards anyone. \n\nEnvy is often seen as a destructive emotion that can lead to discontent, bitterness, and even harm to one's mental peace. It is a reflection of one's dissatisfaction with their own state and a desire to possess what others have. This verse encourages us to liberate ourselves from the shackles of such harmful emotions.\n\nThis Kural highlights an important aspect of human character, suggesting that true excellence lies not in wealth, power, or material possessions, but in the purity of one's mind and heart. A person who does not feel envy is at peace with themselves and their circumstances, which leads to a harmonious and fulfilling life. This state of mind, the Kural suggests, is the highest virtue one can aspire to have. \n\nThe Tamil explanations echo similar sentiments, emphasizing the importance of freedom from envy and stating that there is no greater virtue than not harboring envy towards anyone. They suggest that such a state of mind is the highest achievement one can attain..The kural verse:அறன்ஆக்கம் வேண்டாதான் என்பான் பிறனாக்கம்பேணாது அழுக்கறுப் பான். ,translates to :Who envies others' good fortune  Can't prosper in virtue of his own,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the negative attribute of envy. The verse says that a person who harbors envy towards the prosperity and wealth of others is someone who neither values virtue nor seeks wealth.\n\nThis verse underlines the importance of appreciating and rejoicing in the success of others, rather than being envious. It points out that envy is a destructive emotion that not only harms relationships but also hinders one's personal growth and development. \n\nThe verse further suggests that such a person shows no interest in gaining virtue or wealth. This is because envy often stems from a lack of contentment and satisfaction. A person who is content with what he/she has will not covet others' wealth. On the other hand, a person who is discontented will always compare his/her situation with others and develop feelings of envy. \n\nHence, it is important to cultivate a sense of contentment and satisfaction in life. This can lead to inner peace, happiness, and personal growth. Furthermore, it can also foster positive relationships with others, as one learns to appreciate their success without harboring feelings of envy. \n\nFrom a moral perspective, this verse teaches us the importance of avoiding envy and cultivating a sense of appreciation and contentment. It encourages us to strive for personal growth and development, rather than wasting our energy on negative emotions like envy. It tells us to value virtue and wealth, and to seek them through rightful means, instead of coveting what others have..The kural verse:அழுக்காற்றின் அல்லவை செய்யார் இழுக்காற்றின்ஏதம் படுபாக்கு அறிந்து. ,translates to :The wise through envy don't others wrong  Knowing that woes from evils throng,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the wisdom of refraining from actions that are borne out of envy. It suggests that those who are truly wise understand the consequences of such actions and hence, avoid engaging in them. They are aware that envy can lead to wrongdoing, and wrongdoing, in turn, can lead to suffering and misery.\n\nThe verse gives emphasis to the concept of 'Karma' or the law of cause and effect, which exists in many cultures and religions. In simple terms, it means that every action has a consequence. If one engages in harmful actions, born out of negative emotions like envy, it will result in misery and suffering.\n\nTherefore, the wise ones, understanding this principle, abstain from indulging in unrighteous deeds driven by envy. They practice self-restraint and maintain their moral integrity, aware of the adverse outcomes they will have to face otherwise.\n\nIn essence, this Kural verse instills the understanding that wisdom lies in knowing the outcomes of our actions and making the right choices to live a life of righteousness, devoid of negative emotions like envy. This guidance remains relevant to this day, reminding us to live with a sense of awareness and responsibility towards our actions..The kural verse:அழுக்காறு உடையார்க்கு அதுசாலும் ஒன்னார்வழுக்காயும் கேடீன் பது. ,translates to :Man shall be wrecked by envy's whim  Even if enemies spare him,and it's explantion is :Kural 165 discusses the self-destructive nature of envy. It posits that for those who harbor envy, no external enemy is required for their downfall - the envy alone is sufficient to cause their destruction. \n\nThis verse underscores the principle that internal vices such as envy, jealousy, and resentment can lead to one's downfall, just as much (or even more so) than external threats or enemies. The destructive power of envy lies in its ability to consume the person from within, leading to negative thoughts and actions, affecting their mental peace, relationships, and overall wellbeing. \n\nThiruvalluvar, through this Kural, emphasizes the importance of maintaining a clean heart free from envy and ill-will towards others, as these negative emotions can become the architect of our own destruction. It is a call for self-improvement, advocating for personal growth by overcoming such self-destructive emotions. \n\nIn a broader cultural context, this verse reflects the ancient Tamil value system that places a high premium on virtues like compassion, generosity, and joy in the success of others, and sees vices like envy and resentment as destructive and self-defeating..The kural verse:கொடுப்பது அழுக்கறுப்பான் சுற்றம் உடுப்பதூஉம்உண்பதூஉம் இன்றிக் கெடும். ,translates to :Who envies gifts shall suffer ruin  Without food and clothes with his kin,and it's explantion is :Kural 166 speaks about the harmful effects of envy, especially when it is directed towards the generosity extended to others. It warns that such envy doesn't only harm the individual who harbors it, but it also brings ruin to their family and their surrounding relationships. When someone becomes envious of the aid or gift given to another, this negative emotion can lead to downfall and destitution, depriving them not only of material possessions but also of sustenance and the basic needs of life.\n\nIn the cultural context, this verse emphasizes the importance of good will and generosity in the society, and discourages the destructive emotion of envy which can disrupt social harmony. It teaches us that it is crucial to appreciate and respect the acts of kindness and generosity extended towards others, as grudging them can lead to personal and communal downfall. This verse serves as a moral lesson against envy, advocating for understanding, acceptance and positivity in the society..The kural verse:அவ்வித்து அழுக்காறு உடையானைச் செய்யவள்தவ்வையைக் காட்டி விடும். ,translates to :Fortune deserts the envious  Leaving misfortune omnious,and it's explantion is :The Kural 167 emphasizes the negative consequences of envy. It is a common belief in Tamil culture that prosperity (Lakshmi) and adversity (Mudevi - Lakshmi's sister) are represented as sisters. The verse suggests that if a person harbors envy, it is as if prosperity herself takes offense, and to punish him, introduces him to her sister, adversity, indicating a shift from wealth to poverty.\n\nThe verse metaphorically interprets the consequences of envy. It suggests that prosperity (Lakshmi) does not favor those who are envious of others. Instead, she leaves such individuals and introduces them to her sister, adversity. This implies that envy leads to the loss of prosperity and the onset of hardship.\n\nThe verse is a moral reminder that negative emotions such as envy can lead to negative outcomes in life. It encourages individuals to be content with what they have and not be envious of others' success or prosperity. The verse reinforces the traditional Tamil value of being content and not harboring negative feelings towards others' achievements..The kural verse:அழுக்காறு எனஒரு பாவி திருச்செற்றுத்தீயுழி உய்த்து விடும். ,translates to :Caitiff envy despoils wealth  And drags one into evil path,and it's explantion is :The 168th Kural states that envy, represented as a destructive vice, can not only demolish a person's wealth in their current lifetime but also lead them down the path of damnation in their afterlife. \n\nEnvy is seen as a destructive emotion that not only harms the person who harbours it but also puts their material and spiritual well-being at risk. It is characterized as an insatiable evil that consumes a person's wealth, which could symbolize their happiness, prosperity, or peace of mind in this context.\n\nMoreover, it is believed in many religions and philosophical doctrines that our actions in this life determine our fate in the afterlife. Following this belief, the verse suggests that envy can lead one to a 'pit of fire' in the world to come, symbolizing a state of suffering or punishment in the afterlife. \n\nIn a broader sense, the verse warns against the perilous nature of envy, emphasizing how it can lead to self-destruction and spiritual downfall. It urges individuals to practice contentment, gratitude, and generosity to lead a prosperous and virtuous life.\n\nThis Kural is a profound reminder that harboring negative emotions like envy can lead to self-inflicted suffering, both in this life and the next. It encourages individuals to foster positive emotions and virtues for a peaceful and prosperous life..The kural verse:அவ்விய நெஞ்சத்தான் ஆக்கமும் செவ்வியான்கேடும் நினைக்கப் படும். ,translates to :Why is envy rich, goodmen poor  People with surprise think over,and it's explantion is :The Kural 169 means that the prosperity of a person with an envious heart, and the misfortune of a person who is righteous, will indeed be subject to serious contemplation. \n\nThe verse subtly emphasizes the paradoxical nature of life, where sometimes individuals of negative virtues seem to thrive while those of pure heart struggle. However, it also implies that such conditions are temporary and subject to scrutiny and inevitable change.\n\nOn one hand, it refers to an individual with an envious heart who despite his/her negative qualities may appear prosperous. This prosperity, however, is transient and often devoid of peace and happiness. On the other hand, the verse also talks about a righteous person who may be undergoing distress or poverty. This situation too is temporary and serves to enhance the person's virtues and resilience.\n\nIn essence, the verse is an observation about the impermanent and often paradoxical nature of worldly success and failure. It encourages us to look beyond superficial appearances and understand that true wealth lies not in material prosperity but in the richness of one's character. It also urges us to be patient and maintain our values, regardless of our circumstances, as they are subject to change.\n.The kural verse:அழுக்கற்று அகன்றாரும் இல்லை அஃதுஇல்லார்பெருக்கத்தில் தீர்ந்தாரும் இல். ,translates to :The envious prosper never  The envyless prosper ever,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural emphasizes the significance of envy in the journey of success. Thiruvalluvar, the author, prescribes that envy is a detrimental trait that inhibits one's path to greatness. He asserts that there have been no instances where envious individuals have reached heights of success. Envy, in this context, is seen as a barrier to personal growth and prosperity.\n\nConversely, he underscores that those who are free from the clutches of envy have never been without greatness. It implies that the absence of envy fosters personal development and paves the way for success. This absence permits individuals to focus on their own progress rather than comparing themselves to others which often leads to unnecessary dissatisfaction and resentment.\n\nIn essence, the verse portrays envy as a negative emotion that obstructs the path to success and self-improvement. In contrast, a lack of envy enables individuals to focus on their own growth and accomplishments, leading to a state of greatness. Therefore, Thiruvalluvar encourages the elimination of envy to achieve personal success and satisfaction..The kural verse:நடுவின்றி நன்பொருள் வெஃகின் குடிபொன்றிக்குற்றமும் ஆங்கே தரும். ,translates to :Who covets others' honest wealth  That greed ruins his house forthwith,and it's explantion is :Kural 171 advises on the perils of coveting or taking what rightfully belongs to others, particularly when done so by abandoning fairness and justice. The verse suggests that if one yearns for and seizes another's rightful property, it will result in the destruction of their own household and will invite guilt. \n\nThe verse underlines the concept of karma where actions have consequences. It warns that disregard for the principles of justice and fairness will not only lead to the downfall of one's family but will also incur guilt and moral degradation. By mentioning that these consequences arrive 'at that very time', the verse emphasizes the immediacy of the repercussions of such unjust actions. \n\nThiru Kural here advocates for equity, respect for others' properties, and uprightness in dealings. It encourages individuals to refrain from unjust desires and actions, reminding them of the severe consequences they could face, including the destruction of their family and the burden of guilt..The kural verse:படுபயன் வெஃகிப் பழிப்படுவ செய்யார்நடுவன்மை நாணு பவர். ,translates to :Who shrink with shame from sin, refrain  From coveting which brings ruin,and it's explantion is :Kural 172 addresses the virtue of fairness and the fear of disgrace. This verse emphasizes that those who value balance and equity, those who feel ashamed when they deviate from justice, will not resort to disgraceful acts out of greed for profit. They are the ones who are sensitive to the moral compass within them and would not risk tainting themselves for transient material gains.\n\nThe verse also indirectly urges for self-respect and dignity, suggesting that one should never compromise their moral integrity for momentary benefits. It champions the notion that the sense of righteousness should outweigh the enticing allure of unjust profits. \n\nIn broader terms, the verse underscores the importance of maintaining ethical conduct in all spheres of life, irrespective of the potential gains that might be accrued through immoral means. It promotes the idea that the fear of social disgrace and self-reproach are effective deterrents to wrongdoing, thereby encouraging a societal structure built on fairness and justice..The kural verse:சிற்றின்பம் வெஃகி அறனல்ல செய்யாரேமற்றின்பம் வேண்டு பவர். ,translates to :For spiritual bliss who long  For fleeting joy commit no wrong,and it's explantion is :Kural 173 emphasizes the moral values of individuals who are on the path of righteousness, and their desire for the enduring pleasures that result from being virtuous. According to the verse, those who aspire for the long-term, profound joy and benefits that come from adhering to moral principles and virtuous conduct, would not deviate from this path for the sake of transient or fleeting pleasures.\n\nThe verse highlights the significance of prioritizing long-term happiness and satisfaction over short-term, ephemeral joys. It underscores the idea that those who truly value and aim for the higher pleasures that come from being virtuous, would not engage in unjust or immoral actions merely to satisfy their immediate desires. \n\nIn essence, this verse teaches the importance of integrity, patience, and long-term thinking. It counsels against succumbing to momentary temptations that could lead one astray from the path of righteousness, and instead encourages maintaining steadfastness in upholding virtue and morality, for the sake of achieving enduring happiness and peace..The kural verse:இலமென்று வெஃகுதல் செய்யார் புலம்வென்றபுன்மையில் காட்சி யவர். ,translates to :The truth-knowers of sense-control  Though in want covet not at all,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse 174 discusses the virtue of conquering one's senses and abstaining from desiring what belongs to others. It emphasizes that those who have mastered their senses and are devoid of wrongdoing would not covet other people's possessions, even in a state of destitution.\n\nThe verse essentially presents a profound moral principle that highlights the strength of character. It implies that true wisdom is not just about intellectual knowledge, but it also involves self-control, moral integrity, and the ability to resist the temptation of covetousness. It underlines that even in the face of extreme poverty, the wise and virtuous will not succumb to the lure of ill-gotten gains. \n\nThe verse also underscores the importance of contentment and acceptance of one's circumstances. It suggests that one's circumstances, however dire they might be, should not be a reason or an excuse to covet or seize what rightfully belongs to others. \n\nIn essence, this verse upholds the virtue of self-restraint, moral uprightness, and contentment, and denounces the act of desiring other's possessions, indicating that such actions are not the characteristics of the truly wise and virtuous..The kural verse:அஃகி அகன்ற அறிவென்னாம் யார்மாட்டும்வெஃகி வெறிய செயின். ,translates to :What is one's subtle wisdom worth  If it deals ill with all on earth,and it's explantion is :Kural 175 emphasizes the importance of wisdom in action, rather than merely possessing knowledge. The verse suggests that if one possesses extensive and accurate knowledge but acts senselessly out of greed, coveting others' possessions, then the value of such knowledge is questioned. \n\nIn essence, it underscores the importance of moral conduct and ethical behavior, asserting that knowledge is not merely about accumulation, but about its application in life. If one's actions are driven by covetousness and lack of consideration for others, then the knowledge they possess serves no real purpose and loses its value. \n\nThis Kural, therefore, is a reminder to use knowledge thoughtfully and responsibly, with respect for others' rights and possessions. It urges us to apply our knowledge in actions that are guided by moral and ethical principles, rather than being driven by selfish desires and greed. \n\nIn other words, the real benefit of knowledge is not in having it but in how we use it. Knowledge used for unethical purposes is no better than ignorance. Knowledge should guide us to act wisely and ethically, and not lead us to harm or cheat others..The kural verse:அருள்வெஃகி ஆற்றின்கண் நின்றான் பொருள்வெஃகிப்பொல்லாத சூழக் கெடும். ,translates to :Who seeks for grace on righteous path  Suffers by evil covetous wealth,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse 176 emphasizes the importance of integrity and moral conduct, particularly for those who aspire to live a life of virtue and kindness. \n\nThe verse suggests that if a person who cherishes kindness and adheres to a path that promotes such virtue, then deviates from this path by desiring the wealth of others or thinking of unjust means to acquire it, they will inevitably face downfall. \n\nThe verse does not just condemn the act of desiring others' property, but it also warns against the contemplation of immoral acts. This underlines the belief in Thirukural that even the thought of an evil act is as harmful as the act itself.\n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes the importance of remaining steadfast in one's path of virtue and kindness, and that any deviation, whether in thought or action, can lead to one's ruin. The verse reminds us that true virtue lies not just in the absence of harmful actions, but also in the absence of harmful thoughts and desires. \n\nIn broader terms, this verse can be seen as an encouragement to maintain integrity in all aspects of life, to resist the temptation to gain wealth or power through unjust means, and to uphold the values of kindness and generosity..The kural verse:வேண்டற்க வெஃகியாம் ஆக்கம் விளைவயின்மாண்டற் கரிதாம் பயன். ,translates to :Shun the fruit of covetousness  All its yield is inglorious,and it's explantion is :Kural 177 urges individuals to avoid the desire to gain wealth or benefits through covetousness, which can be understood as a strong desire to acquire others' possessions. This can come in many forms such as theft, deceit, or dishonesty. \n\nThe verse highlights the moral implications of such actions, stating that there is no honour or glory in enjoying the fruits of such gains. Essentially, the wealth or benefits gained through dishonest means do not bring true happiness or respect. Instead, they may lead to disgrace and negative consequences, tarnishing one's reputation and self-respect.\n\nThe verse is deeply rooted in the concept of ethical living, advocating for honesty and fairness in one's dealings. It also emphasizes the importance of contentment with one's own possessions and discourages envy or greed for others' belongings. This aligns with the broader themes of Thiru Kural, which deeply values virtuous and ethical living. \n\nIn summary, Kural 177 advises against the desire for gains acquired through covetousness, highlighting that such gains bring no real benefit or honour but instead lead to negative outcomes. It encourages individuals to live with integrity, fairness, and contentment..The kural verse:அஃகாமை செல்வத்திற்கு யாதெனின் வெஃகாமைவேண்டும் பிறன்கைப் பொருள். ,translates to :The mark of lasting wealth is shown  By not coveting others' own,and it's explantion is :Kural 178 emphasizes the importance of freedom from covetousness for the sustainability and growth of one's wealth. It suggests that the surest way to preserve and increase one's wealth is not to covet or desire what belongs to others. \n\nThe verse points out that the desire to possess what belongs to others could lead to detrimental actions such as stealing, cheating, and other forms of dishonesty, which could ultimately lead to the loss of one's wealth. \n\nMore broadly, this verse underscores the moral principle that one should be content with what they have and strive to increase their wealth through righteous means. This approach ensures the sustainability of wealth and promotes harmony and fairness in society. \n\nIn essence, the verse promotes the ethical principle of not coveting others' possessions as a means to preserve and increase one's wealth. It encourages contentment, fairness, and ethical conduct in the pursuit of wealth, which are critical values in a harmonious and prosperous society..The kural verse:அறனறிந்து வெஃகா அறிவுடையார்ச் சேரும்திறன்அறிந் தாங்கே திரு. ,translates to :Fortune seeks the just and wise  Who are free from coveting vice,and it's explantion is :The Kural 179 advises that Goddess Lakshmi, the deity of wealth and prosperity, favors those who are virtuous and wise. These individuals are characterized by their lack of desire for others' possessions, recognizing that such covetousness is not virtuous. The verse emphasizes the importance of understanding virtue and acting accordingly.\n\nThe verse suggests that those who understand the true nature of virtue and refrain from coveting others' wealth will naturally attract prosperity. It implies that wealth, represented by Goddess Lakshmi, recognizes and appreciates the moral strength and ethical conduct of such individuals, and therefore, chooses to reside with them.\n\nThe verse underscores the principle that virtue and wisdom are the real attractors of wealth and prosperity, and not unethical means or greed. This principle resonates with the ethical and moral philosophy of Thiru Kural, which promotes the path of righteousness and moral integrity..The kural verse:இறலீனும் எண்ணாது வெஃகின் விறல்ஈனும்வேண்டாமை என்னுஞ் செருக்கு. ,translates to :Desireless, greatness conquers all;  Coveting misers ruined fall,and it's explantion is :Kural 180 emphasizes the detrimental consequences of coveting another's wealth without considering the repercussions, and the triumph that comes with a mind free from such desires. \n\nThe verse essentially states that harboring avarice for another person's wealth, heedless of the potential consequences, leads to one's downfall. This could be due to the unethical actions one might resort to in order to obtain that wealth, or the negative karma that might follow such covetous thinking. \n\nIn contrast, the verse extols the virtue of contentment and not desiring what belongs to others. Such a mindset is said to bring victory in life. This could be interpreted as peace of mind, the respect and trust of others, and a life free from guilt or regret. \n\nIn a broader sense, this Kural teaches us the importance of ethical living, the value of contentment, and the dangers of unchecked desires. It encourages us to appreciate what we have, rather than coveting what others possess, for true victory lies not in material wealth, but in the richness of one's character and the tranquility of one's mind..The kural verse:அறங்கூறான் அல்ல செயினும் ஒருவன்புறங்கூறான் என்றல் இனிது. ,translates to :Though a man from virtue strays,  To keep from slander brings him praise,and it's explantion is :This kural places great emphasis on the virtue of not engaging in backbiting or slander, even when the individual does not adhere to moral principles or engages in sinful activities. Thiruvalluvar, the author, suggests that not speaking ill of others is such a significant moral quality that it has the power to redeem an otherwise morally lacking individual.\n\nThe kural underscores the harm and negativity that backbiting can bring, suggesting that it is one of the worst actions one can commit. In a way, it's a call to be mindful of our words and actions towards others, and to uphold respect and kindness, regardless of our other flaws.\n\nTo put it simply, even if a person does not adhere to virtues, if they are known as someone who doesn't backbite, it is a redeeming quality. The underlying message here is the importance of respectful communication and the harm that negative speech can cause. Even in the absence of other virtues, refraining from speaking ill of others is, in itself, a significant virtue..The kural verse:அறனழீஇ அல்லவை செய்தலின் தீதேபுறனழீஇப் பொய்த்து நகை. ,translates to :Who bite behind, and before smile  Are worse than open traitors vile,and it's explantion is :Kural 182 delves into the theme of deceit and hypocrisy. The verse states that to smile deceitfully in someone's presence after having disparaged them behind their back is a greater evil than committing any sin or destroying any virtue. This is because such behavior not only harms the person who is the subject of slander, but it also shows a lack of integrity on the part of the person doing the slandering.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of honesty and sincerity in human relationships. It suggests that it is better to be upfront about one's feelings and grievances than to harbor ill-will and express it behind someone's back while pretending to be friendly in their presence. Such behavior is seen as morally repugnant and worse than even the act of engaging in dishonest actions.\n\nThe cultural context in which this verse is set values truthfulness and integrity highly. It denounces two-facedness and deception as being worse than the disregard of moral principles. The verse, thus, serves as a moral lesson to its readers, urging them to practice honesty, sincerity, and integrity in all their interactions. It posits that deceit and hypocrisy are destructive, not only to the individuals involved but also to the moral fabric of society..The kural verse:புறங்கூறிப் பொய்த்துயிர் வாழ்தலின் சாதல்அறங்கூற்றும் ஆக்கத் தரும். ,translates to :Virtue thinks it better to die,  Than live to backbite and to lie,and it's explantion is :Kural 183 draws attention to the detrimental effects of deceit and backbiting, stating that death is more favorable than a life filled with such vices. The verse underlines that individuals who engage in deceitful behavior and speak ill of others behind their backs, yet maintain a facade of goodwill in their presence, are leading a life of falsehood. \n\nThe moral stance of the verse is that integrity, honesty, and truthfulness are far superior virtues and that a life devoid of these qualities is not worth living. Thiruvalluvar, the author of Thiru Kural, suggests that such deceitful behavior leads to a life of dishonor and ignominy, which is worse than death itself. \n\nHe further emphasizes that the teachings of virtue, or moral codes, suggest that even death is preferable to a life lived in deceit and falsehood. This is because death is considered a natural and inevitable part of life, while deceit and backbiting are viewed as moral failings that tarnish one's character and reputation. The verse thus promotes the values of honesty and integrity, and denounces deceitful behavior and backbiting. \n\nIn essence, this Kural teaches us that it is better to die with honor than to live a life of deception and duplicity..The kural verse:கண்ணின்று கண்ணறச் சொல்லினும் சொல்லற்கமுன்னின்று பின்நோக்காச் சொல். ,translates to :Though harsh you speak in one's presence  Abuse is worse in his absence,and it's explantion is :Kural 184 emphasizes the importance of integrity and respect in our speech. It suggests that it's acceptable to openly criticize someone's flaws or mistakes directly to their face, even if it's done harshly, as it promotes transparency and honesty. However, it warns against speaking ill of someone in their absence without considering the potential harm or consequences that could result from it.\n\nThis verse encourages direct confrontation and discourages gossip or backbiting. It highlights the negative impact of talking behind someone's back without thinking about the potential fallout or harm it might cause. Essentially, it's a reminder to be mindful of our words and to treat others with respect, extending the same courtesy of directness and honesty whether they are present or not.\n\nThis Kural is a timeless piece of wisdom that holds true in any culture or era. It teaches us about the values of honesty, integrity, respect and the power of words which can build or destroy relationships. The verse urges us to be responsible and considerate in our speech, making it a valuable lesson in effective communication and ethical conduct..The kural verse:அறஞ்சொல்லும் நெஞ்சத்தான் அன்மை புறஞ்சொல்லும்புன்மையாற் காணப் படும். ,translates to :Who turns to slander makes it plain  His praise of virtue is in vain,and it's explantion is :Kural 185 essentially conveys the idea that one's genuineness or sincerity cannot be solely determined by their public praise of virtue or righteousness. It brings to light the importance of character, particularly when one is not in the public eye or when dealing with others in their absence. \n\nThe verse implies that if a person speaks ill or disparages others behind their backs, it reveals a lack of true virtue in their heart, regardless of how much they publicly laud morality. In other words, the genuine virtue of a person is not just about praising righteousness but also about refraining from negative actions such as backbiting or slander. \n\nThis Kural teaches us that our actions when unobserved are a more accurate measure of our character than our words in public. It encourages us not only to speak of virtue but to practice it consistently in our dealings with others, whether they are present or absent. This is a timeless message that remains highly relevant in today's world, where it's easy to portray a certain image in public while acting differently in private. \n\nThe verse advocates for authenticity, integrity, and consistency in one's actions and words, emphasizing that true virtue lies in the harmony between what we preach and what we practice..The kural verse:பிறன்பழி கூறுவான் தன்பழி யுள்ளும்திறன்தெரிந்து கூறப் படும். ,translates to :His failings will be found and shown,  Who makes another's failings known,and it's explantion is :Kural 186 talks about the principle of reciprocity when it comes to highlighting others' faults. The verse suggests that if one person openly speaks about another person's faults, then his own faults will also be sought out and disclosed by others. This is a simple yet profound lesson on the universal law of karma or cause and effect, and the importance of treating others with respect and kindness.\n\nIn a broader context, the verse also implies the importance of self-reflection and self-improvement. Instead of focusing on others' faults, one should strive to rectify and improve oneself. By doing so, one would not only develop a better character but would also cease to provoke others into scrutinizing and broadcasting their faults.\n\nThe verse also cautions against the tendency to engage in harmful gossip or slander, as such actions often backfire, leading to one's own faults being exposed. In essence, the Kural encourages self-awareness, self-improvement, and respect for others, while discouraging harmful gossip and judgment of others..The kural verse:பகச்சொல்லிக் கேளிர்ப் பிரிப்பர் நகச்சொல்லிநட்பாடல் தேற்றா தவர். ,translates to :By pleasing words who make not friends  Sever their hearts by hostile trends,and it's explantion is :Kural 187 emphasizes the importance of positive, supportive communication in maintaining good relationships, and the damage that can be caused by negative, backbiting speech. \n\nThe verse suggests that those who are unable to cultivate strong bonds through pleasant and enjoyable conversation will tend to resort to gossip or backbiting. This negative behavior can cause even close relationships, such as those with family or friends, to become estranged. In essence, it highlights that the lack of skill to engage in pleasant conversation, or the inability to appreciate its value, can lead to the deterioration of relationships. \n\nThe verse serves as a reminder to avoid harmful speech and to instead focus on positive, constructive dialogues that foster strong and healthy relationships. It also warns of the potential consequences of gossip or backbiting, which can isolate individuals and erode the trust within their relationships. \n\nThis verse is applicable in all aspects of life, whether it be personal relationships, social interactions, or professional environments. It encourages us to be mindful of our words, to speak kindly and constructively, and to refrain from harmful or negative speech..The kural verse:துன்னியார் குற்றமும் தூற்றும் மரபினார்என்னைகொல் ஏதிலார் மாட்டு. ,translates to :What will they not to strangers do  Who bring their friends' defects to view?,and it's explantion is :The Kural 188 asserts a moral caution about the behavior of individuals who tend to criticize and reveal the faults of their close friends to others. The verse suggests an apprehension about the extent of damage such individuals could do when dealing with strangers. \n\nThe verse is essentially warning about those who lack loyalty and discretion, even towards their intimate friends. If they are willing to expose their friends' shortcomings, one can only imagine the extent of harm they could inflict upon strangers or those they are not close with. \n\nThe verse prompts introspection and encourages the practice of loyalty, discretion, and respect for the privacy of others' faults and mistakes. It reminds us to be careful about the company we keep and to avoid those who betray trust and confidence..The kural verse:அறன்நோக்கி ஆற்றுங்கொல் வையம் புறன்நோக்கிப்புன்சொல் உரைப்பான் பொறை. ,translates to :The world in mercy bears his load  Who rants behind words untoward,and it's explantion is :Kural 189 is a verse that emphasizes the importance of ethical conduct in speech and condemns the act of backbiting or derogatory speech about someone in their absence. This kural uses a metaphor to elucidate this moral principle.\n\nThe kural states, \"The world through charity supports the weight of those who reproach others observing their absence.\" This means that the world, out of its innate goodness and sense of duty, continues to support those who insult or belittle others when they are not present. This \"support\" is compared to the act of charity suggesting that even though these individuals engage in hurtful speech, the world, in its benevolence, does not abandon them.\n\nThe crux of this verse lies in the moral obligation to speak truthfully and respectfully about others, particularly in their absence. It discourages the act of backbiting and encourages individuals to act and speak in a manner that respects the dignity and reputation of others. The verse suggests that while the world may continue to support such individuals out of its charity, such behavior is not in accordance with the principles of morality and righteousness.\n\nIn a broader context, this verse underscores the importance of responsible speech in maintaining harmony and trust within a community or society. It advocates for the principles of honesty, respect, and fairness in our interactions with others..The kural verse:ஏதிலார் குற்றம்போல் தங்குற்றங் காண்கிற்பின்தீதுண்டோ மன்னும் உயிர்க்கு. ,translates to :No harm would fall to any man  If each his own defect could scan,and it's explantion is :Kural 190 emphasizes the importance of self-reflection and introspection. The verse points out that people often tend to notice and critique the flaws of others, while overlooking or ignoring their own faults. The Kural posits a rhetorical question, suggesting that if people scrutinized their own faults with the same intensity as they do others, they would likely prevent many problems and miseries in their lives. \n\nIn essence, the verse promotes the practice of self-improvement and self-regulation, asserting that the key to a peaceful and harmonious life lies in acknowledging and rectifying one's own flaws, rather than focusing on the faults of others. This introspective approach could lead to personal growth, enhanced relationships and overall wellbeing. \n\nIn the cultural context of Thirukkural, this verse aligns with the broader themes of ethical living, personal responsibility and self-improvement that are prevalent throughout the text..The kural verse:பல்லார் முனியப் பயனில சொல்லுவான்எல்லாரும் எள்ளப் படும். ,translates to :With silly words who insults all  Is held in contempt as banal,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural, written by the ancient Tamil philosopher Valluvar, asserts the importance of thoughtful and meaningful speech. \n\nThe verse maintains that a person who consistently speaks in a manner that is widely considered offensive and without any beneficial substance will ultimately be held in contempt by everyone. The disapproval or contempt does not only come from those who are directly pained or annoyed by such speech, but from everyone in the society, as they all recognize the lack of value in his words.\n\nThe underlying moral is about the power and impact of our words. Speech is a powerful tool that can either build or destroy relationships and reputations. Valluvar advises us to use this tool wisely, to communicate effectively and respectfully, and to always consider the impact of our words on others. In essence, this Kural promotes meaningful and beneficial speech that contributes positively to society, and warns against thoughtless and offensive words..The kural verse:பயனில பல்லார்முன் சொல்லல் நயனிலநட்டார்கண் செய்தலிற் றீது. ,translates to :Vain talk before many is worse  Than doing to friends deeds adverse,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 192, from Thiru Kural emphasises the importance of mindful communication, particularly in group settings. The verse suggests that uttering pointless or meaningless words in the presence of many is a far graver offence than committing an unkind act towards friends.\n\nIn essence, this verse advocates for thoughtful, meaningful conversation. It highlights the significant impact words can have, especially when spoken in a public or group setting. Talking aimlessly or idly, without contributing anything valuable or beneficial can be seen as a waste of everyone's time and can even demean the speaker's credibility. Such behavior is considered worse than acting unkindly towards friends, which is already a negative act in itself.\n\nThis verse thus encourages us to be cautious and mindful in our speech, ensuring that what we say is worth the time and attention of others. It also reminds us to be considerate in our actions towards friends, emphasizing the importance of kindness and respect in maintaining strong relationships. In a broader sense, it promotes the values of respect, consideration, and thoughtfulness in both speech and actions..The kural verse:நயனிலன் என்பது சொல்லும் பயனிலபாரித் துரைக்கும் உரை. ,translates to :The babbler's hasty lips proclaim  That \\\"good-for-nothing\\\" is his name,and it's explantion is :The couplet or Kural 193, written by the ancient Tamil philosopher Thiruvalluvar, underscores the importance of meaningful and valuable conversation. The essence of this verse is that a person's words serve as the mirror to their character. If a person tends to speak at length about trivial or insignificant matters, it reflects a lack of virtue in them.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the negative impression created by individuals who engage in frivolous talk or gossip, which serves no real purpose. It cautions that such behavior can lead others to perceive them as devoid of moral and ethical values.\n\nIn a broader sense, Thiruvalluvar advises us to focus on constructive and purposeful communication that can contribute positively to ourselves and others. It is an urging to be mindful of our words, as they are a direct reflection of our inner character and virtue.\n\nIn the context of Tamil society, which places a high value on moral virtues and ethical conduct, this verse holds significant importance. It encourages individuals to align their words with their actions and to ensure that their communication is beneficial and meaningful. In the contemporary context, this teaching remains relevant, reminding us of the power and responsibility that come with our words and conversations..The kural verse:நயன்சாரா நன்மையின் நீக்கும் பயன்சாராப்பண்பில்சொல் பல்லா ரகத்து. ,translates to :Vain words before an assembly  Will make all gains and goodness flee,and it's explantion is :Kural 194 emphasizes the importance of mindful speech. It suggests that words spoken without any beneficial intent or proper manners can cause harm by subtracting from one's virtue and happiness. In other words, engaging in aimless chatter or rude talk, especially in the presence of many people, can deplete a person's moral standing and value in society. \n\nThis verse is an endorsement of the old saying, \"Think before you speak.\" It encourages us to speak words that are purposeful, respectful, and in line with ethical standards. If we do not, we risk losing our virtue and the respect of others. This verse reminds us that our words have power and can have lasting effects on our reputation and relationships. Therefore, it is advised to use words wisely and kindly for the overall betterment of oneself and society. \n\nThe verse also subtly points out that the misuse of speech can lead to the erosion of personal joy and well-being, emphasizing the interconnected nature of ethical conduct and personal happiness..The kural verse:சீர்மை சிறப்பொடு நீங்கும் பயனிலநீர்மை யுடையார் சொலின். ,translates to :Glory and grace will go away  When savants silly nonsense say,and it's explantion is :Kural 195 asserts the importance of meaningful and purposeful speech, especially for those who are valued for their good qualities. It states that when individuals of good character indulge in speaking words that carry no value or utility, their reputation, dignity, and the respect they command diminish. This Kural emphasizes that words, particularly those spoken by individuals of high standing, should not be empty or frivolous. Rather, they should be filled with substance and purpose. The primary message of this verse is the significance of responsible and purposeful communication, it also subliminally highlights the power of words and their impact on a person's social standing and reputation..The kural verse:பயனில்சொல் பாராட்டு வானை மகன்எனல்மக்கட் பதடி யெனல். ,translates to :Call him a human chaff who prides  Himself in weightless idle words,and it's explantion is :Kural 196 emphasizes the importance of meaningful and purposeful speech. It states that a person who consistently speaks empty, useless words should not be considered a 'man'. Instead, they should be regarded as the 'chaff of men', which implies they are disposable or insignificant. \n\nThe metaphor used here, 'chaff of men', refers to the husk or the unwanted part of the grain that is discarded during the process of threshing. In this context, it symbolizes people who contribute nothing of value through their words, just like the chaff contributes nothing of nutritional value to the grain.\n\nThe verse implies that speech should not be used merely to flaunt one's eloquence or knowledge. Instead, it should serve a purpose, convey a meaningful message, or carry some form of utility for the listener. Those who speak without purpose or consideration are seen as lacking in wisdom and maturity.\n\nThis Kural, thus, promotes thoughtful and purposeful communication and condemns the misuse of speech for unnecessary verbosity or self-promotion. It highlights the Tamil cultural value of purposeful speech and the negative view of those who speak without offering any valuable insights or contributions..The kural verse:நயனில சொல்லினுஞ் சொல்லுக சான்றோர்பயனில சொல்லாமை நன்று. ,translates to :Let not men of worth vainly quack  Even if they would roughly speak,and it's explantion is :This Kural (Verse 197) emphasizes the importance of useful and meaningful speech. It suggests that even if the words spoken by the wise lack aesthetic or eloquent appeal (excellence), it is acceptable as long as they carry value or utility. The verse further underscores that it is more beneficial for these individuals to refrain from uttering words that bear no meaning or usefulness.\n\nThe crux of this Kural is the promotion of practical wisdom and discouragement of frivolous or pointless speech. This is deeply rooted in the Tamil ethical and philosophical tradition where words are not just seen as sounds but carriers of potent energy and meaning. The wise are advised to use their speech in a way that contributes positively to the listener and society at large, rather than wasting it on meaningless chatter.\n\nIn essence, this verse is a reminder that the power of speech should be used responsibly and constructively. It urges individuals, especially those who are considered wise, to ensure that their words are beneficial, even if they may lack poetic eloquence or charm..The kural verse:அரும்பயன் ஆயும் அறிவினார் சொல்லார்பெரும்பயன் இல்லாத சொல். ,translates to :The wise who weigh the worth refrain  From words that have no grain and brain,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 198, emphasizes the importance of mindful and purposeful communication. The verse suggests that individuals who are wise and seek meaningful, profound experiences in life, will not engage in shallow or insignificant conversations. They are discerning in their choice of words, avoiding utterances that lack depth, value or consequence.\n\nThe phrase \"rare pleasures\" can be interpreted as profound knowledge or deep understanding. Such individuals, driven by their quest for wisdom, ensure that their words carry weight and substance. They do not waste their words on trivial matters, as they recognize the power and impact of speech.\n\nThis verse underscores the principle that speech should not be used frivolously, but should be employed to communicate meaningful and beneficial ideas. It aligns with the broader theme in Thiru Kural that emphasizes the value of wisdom, discernment, and impactful communication. \n\nIn essence, the verse teaches us to speak with intention, to choose our words wisely, and to ensure that our communication is always meaningful and beneficial. It encourages thoughtful and purposeful speech, underlining the power of words and the responsibility we carry when we choose to use them..The kural verse:பொருள்தீர்ந்த பொச்சாந்துஞ் சொல்லார் மருள்தீர்ந்தமாசறு காட்சி யவர். ,translates to :The wise of spotless self-vision  Slip not to silly words-mention,and it's explantion is :This Thirukkural verse, Kural 199, emphasizes the wisdom and discernment of individuals who are free from ignorance and faults. These enlightened individuals are careful with their words, and they do not speak frivolously or without purpose. Even in moments of forgetfulness or distraction, they do not utter words that lack meaning or benefit.\n\nThe verse suggests the value of being mindful and intentional with one's speech. This is not only a sign of wisdom but also of respect for the listener's time and attention. Meaningless chatter is seen as a waste and a sign of a lack of self-discipline and understanding.\n\nMoreover, this verse also implies the importance of having a clear and unclouded mind. Only when one is free from the fog of ignorance can they truly understand the weight and power of words. This discernment allows them to avoid uttering statements that do not contribute to growth, understanding, or any form of positive advancement.\n\nIn essence, this verse is a reminder about the power of words and the responsibility that comes with this power. True wisdom is not just about knowing what to say, but also understanding what not to say..The kural verse:சொல்லுக சொல்லிற் பயனுடைய சொல்லற்கசொல்லிற் பயனிலாச் சொல். ,translates to :To purpose speak the fruitful word  And never indulge in useless load,and it's explantion is :The given verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of thoughtful and meaningful communication. It instructs that one should only speak words that have a useful purpose or impact. Useless or meaningless words that do not contribute any value should be avoided.\n\nThis verse advocates for mindful and purposeful speech. In any conversation or discourse, the words one chooses to use should hold relevance, be beneficial in some way, and contribute positively to the conversation. Speaking words that have no purpose, or that could potentially cause harm or misunderstanding, is discouraged.\n\nThe wisdom of this verse is timeless and universal. In today's world, where communication is rapid and often unconsidered, this verse reminds us to pause and think before we speak, ensuring our words carry value and meaning. It encourages us to use our words to convey knowledge, instill wisdom, resolve conflicts, and promote love and understanding. \n\nThe essence of this verse can be applied to various aspects of life, from personal interactions to professional communication, promoting effective and compassionate communication..The kural verse:தீவினையார் அஞ்சார் விழுமியார் அஞ்சுவர்தீவினை என்னும் செருக்கு. ,translates to :Sinners fear not the pride of sin  The worthy dread the ill within,and it's explantion is :Kural 201 speaks about the contrasting attitudes towards sin between virtuous and wicked individuals. The verse says that those who habitually indulge in wrongful actions, or \"evil deeds,\" do not fear the consequences of their actions. This lack of fear is due to their continuous engagement in such deeds, which has numbed their moral conscience and sense of guilt. In other words, they have become accustomed to behaving in a way that is harmful to themselves and others and no longer fear the moral repercussions.\n\nOn the other hand, virtuous people, or \"the excellent\" as referred to in the verse, fear engaging in wrongful actions. Even if such actions might bring temporary pleasure or gain, they fear the moral and spiritual harm they may cause. This fear is not out of cowardice but rather stems from a deep understanding of the moral order and the potential spiritual consequences of their actions. The \"pride of sin\" mentioned in the verse refers to the misguided belief that one can benefit from wrongdoing without facing any negative consequences.\n\nThis verse underscores the importance of maintaining moral integrity and the need to be wary of the harmful effects of wrongdoing. It also emphasizes the value of moral fear, which acts as a deterrent against engaging in wrongful actions..The kural verse:தீயவை தீய பயத்தலால் தீயவைதீயினும் அஞ்சப் படும். ,translates to :Since evil begets evil dire  Fear ye evil more than fire,and it's explantion is :The Kural 202 emphasizes the consequences of performing harmful actions, illustrating that they should be feared more than fire. The verse suggests that evil deeds, much like fire, can cause widespread harm and have far-reaching repercussions. However, the danger of harmful actions is considered more severe because of the persistent and often irreversible damage they inflict, not only on the recipients but also on the doer.\n\nThe verse also underscores the concept of karma, a central belief in many Eastern philosophies, which states that every action, good or bad, will eventually return to the doer in some form. Therefore, harmful actions are likened to a boomerang that will return to the originator, bringing with it harm equal to or greater than what was initially caused.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar is encouraging individuals to avoid evil deeds out of fear of their destructive outcomes, much like one would keep away from fire to prevent getting burnt. This teaching promotes the universal moral principle of 'do no harm', inspiring individuals to live ethically and considerately..The kural verse:அறிவினுள் எல்லாந் தலையென்ப தீயசெறுவார்க்கும் செய்யா விடல். ,translates to :The wisest of the wise are those  Who injure not even their foes,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 203, emphasizes the supremacy of forbearance. The verse suggests that refraining from retaliating or returning harm to those who have caused harm to us is the highest form of wisdom. \n\nThe verse underlines the principle of non-retaliation which is considered the highest virtue in many philosophies and religions. This idea is rooted in the belief that responding to negativity with more negativity only perpetuates a cycle of harm. Instead, it advocates for patience, understanding, and forgiveness as the best response to ill-treatment. \n\nThe Tamil explanations also echo the same sentiment, stating that refraining from inflicting harm, even on those who have harmed us, is considered the highest form of wisdom. This principle is often lauded as the pinnacle of moral and intellectual maturity, highlighting the importance of compassion and empathy in human interactions. \n\nThe Kural thus teaches us the value of rising above the instinct for revenge, advocating for peace and understanding instead. It encourages us to act with wisdom and kindness, even in the face of adversity or ill-will..The kural verse:மறந்தும் பிறன்கேடு சூழற்க சூழின்அறஞ்சூழம் சூழ்ந்தவன் கேடு. ,translates to :His ruin virtue plots who plans  The ruin of another man's,and it's explantion is :Kural 204 emphasizes the concept of reciprocity in moral judgment and action. It advises against harboring ill-will or intentions of causing harm to others, even if one forgets about it later. The verse suggests that such malicious intent, even if it is not acted upon or is later forgotten, is against the principles of virtue. \n\nThe underlining principle here is that the universe operates on a sense of moral justice, and actions are met with equal reactions. Thus, if one contemplates causing harm to others, they themselves will eventually face ruin or harm, as dictated by virtue. This is because virtue or righteousness, known as 'Aram' in Tamil, is seen as a universal force that ensures justice and moral balance.\n\nIn essence, this Kural urges us to maintain positive thoughts and intentions towards others, reminding us that negative intentions can invite harm upon ourselves. It emphasizes the importance of purity of thought, benevolence, and the avoidance of malice in upholding a virtuous life..The kural verse:இலன்என்று தீயவை செய்யற்க செய்யின்இலனாகும் மற்றும் பெயர்த்து. ,translates to :Who makes poverty plea for ill  Shall reduce himself poorer still,and it's explantion is :The verse 205 of Thiru Kural advises us against resorting to malicious actions on the pretext of poverty. It suggests that if one commits evil acts in the name of poverty, they will only sink deeper into the abyss of impoverishment. \n\nThe verse essentially promotes the values of righteousness and integrity, even in the face of adversity. It underlines the belief that one's circumstances, no matter how dire, should not justify engaging in harmful actions towards others. \n\nThe moral interpretation of this verse is that wrongdoings will not alleviate one's difficulties but will instead amplify them. Thus, it advocates maintaining a virtuous path despite the challenges that life may present. \n\nIn a broader context, it also highlights the consequences of one's actions, suggesting that engaging in negative actions can lead to a cycle of misfortune. This verse, therefore, encourages moral responsibility, advocating that we should uphold ethical standards, regardless of our personal circumstances..The kural verse:தீப்பால தான்பிறர்கண் செய்யற்க நோய்ப்பாலதன்னை அடல்வேண்டா தான். ,translates to :From wounding others let him refrain  Who would from harm himself remain,and it's explantion is :Kural 206 emphasizes the principle of empathy and reciprocity in human interactions. It suggests that if one does not wish to be affected by harm or sorrow, then they should refrain from causing harm or sorrow to others. This concept is akin to the Golden Rule found in many world philosophies and religions - \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\"\n\nIn more depth, this verse addresses the universal moral law of cause and effect, often known as Karma in Eastern philosophies. It implies that the harm one inflicts on others may eventually return to them, causing them sorrow. Therefore, those who desire a life free from sorrow should abstain from causing harm or distress to others. \n\nThis verse encourages individuals to be conscious of their actions and their impacts on others. It promotes empathy, mutual respect, and consideration as essential virtues for peaceful co-existence. Thus, the verse serves as a reminder to treat others with kindness and compassion, to ensure one's own well-being and happiness..The kural verse:எனைப்பகை யுற்றாரும் உய்வர் வினைப்பகைவீயாது பின்சென்று அடும். ,translates to :Men may escape other foes and live  But sin its deadly blow will give,and it's explantion is :Kural 207 discusses the consequence of one's actions and the concept of retribution. It posits that even if a person has significant external enemies, they might still manage to survive, possibly through diplomacy, strength, or simply by avoiding their adversaries. \n\nHowever, the verse warns, the 'enmity of sin' or the negative consequences of one's own wrongful actions is a different kind of enemy. This enemy is relentless and inescapable. It will persistently pursue the individual, causing suffering and even leading to their downfall. \n\nThe implication here is that our actions have repercussions, and wrong deeds can come back to haunt us. This is a reflection of the universal law of karma, which states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. \n\nThe verse is a moral caution to stay away from wrongful deeds, as the harm caused by these actions is often more severe and inevitable than any external enmity. In other words, we are often our own worst enemy when we engage in wrongful actions..The kural verse:தீயவை செய்தார் கெடுதல் நிழல்தன்னைவீயாது அஇஉறைந் தற்று. ,translates to :Ruin follows who evil do  As shadow follows as they go,and it's explantion is :Kural 208 draws a vivid analogy between a person's shadow and the inevitable consequences of their wrongdoings. Just as a shadow is inseparable from the person, regardless of their actions or movements, the aftermath of their misdeeds is similarly unescapable.\n\nThe verse warns that those who engage in harmful or evil actions will inevitably face the repercussions of their actions. This is akin to their own shadow, which never leaves them. No matter where they go or what they do, their shadow remains attached to them, just as the consequences of their actions are always close behind, ready to catch up with them when they least expect it.\n\nThis verse underscores the principle of karma, a universal law of cause and effect, which is a core belief in many Eastern philosophies. It emphasizes the moral responsibility of every individual for their actions and the inevitable retribution they will face for their misdeeds.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar advises us to lead a virtuous life, refraining from harmful actions, as the repercussions of such actions are as constant and unavoidable as our own shadow..The kural verse:தன்னைத்தான் காதல னாயின் எனைத்தொன்றும்துன்னற்க தீவினைப் பால். ,translates to :Let none who loves himself at all  Think of evil however small,and it's explantion is :This Thirukkural, verse 209, emphasizes the importance of self-love and morality in one's life. The verse states that if one truly loves themselves, they must abstain from committing any sin, regardless of how small or insignificant it may seem. \n\nThis verse underlines the concept that self-love is not just about taking care of one's physical wellbeing, but also about maintaining one's moral and ethical integrity. It suggests that those who truly care about themselves will strive to live a virtuous life, free from harmful actions or sins, no matter how small they might be. \n\nIn the broader cultural context, this verse reflects the ancient Tamil value system where personal integrity and ethical conduct were held in high regard. It teaches the value of self-discipline and moral responsibility, reminding us that every action, big or small, has consequences.\n\nIn essence, this verse is a timeless reminder that true self-love entails respecting oneself enough to avoid any immoral or unethical behaviour, even if it seems insignificant. It underscores the importance of moral integrity as an integral part of self-respect and self-care..The kural verse:அருங்கேடன் என்பது அறிக மருங்கோடித்தீவினை செய்யான் எனின். ,translates to :He is secure, know ye, from ills  Who slips not right path to do evils,and it's explantion is :Kural 210 is a profound verse that underscores the importance of moral integrity and righteous conduct. The verse states that one who refrains from inflicting harm on others and stays away from evil deeds, straying neither to the left nor the right of the path of righteousness, is truly free from any potential harm or destruction.\n\nThe metaphor of not going to either side of the right path signifies the importance of maintaining a balanced, ethical approach to life without succumbing to extremes. It underscores the significance of moderation and urges individuals to adhere to the middle path of virtue, avoiding both excessive self-indulgence and severe self-denial.\n\nThe verse also emphasizes the principle of karma - the belief that one's actions determine their fate. It suggests that by avoiding harmful actions, one can prevent potential harm or misfortune from befalling them. This principle encourages individuals to be mindful of their actions, as they not only impact others but also shape their own destiny.\n\nIn essence, Kural 210 advises individuals to lead a life of righteousness, free from causing harm to others, and assures them that such a lifestyle will safeguard them from any form of destruction or adversity..The kural verse:கைம்மாறு வேண்டா கடப்பாடு மாரிமாட்டுஎன் ஆற்றுங் கொல்லோ உலகு. ,translates to :Duty demands nothing in turn;  How can the world recompense rain?,and it's explantion is :This couplet or Kural 211 from the Thirukkural, penned by the ancient Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar, emphasizes the nature of true benevolence or generosity. It compares the act of giving to the way the clouds provide rain. \n\nThe metaphor of the cloud is used to denote a selfless giver. Just like the clouds that pour down rain without expecting anything in return from the earth, true benevolence does not expect any form of reciprocation. It is an act of pure generosity where the doer does not look for a return or even a word of gratitude.\n\nThe second line of the Kural questions, \"What can the world give back to the clouds?\" This rhetorical question serves to highlight the idea that there are acts of giving that are so vast and generous that they can never truly be repaid. Just like the world cannot repay the clouds for their life-giving rain, the beneficiary cannot fully reciprocate a truly generous act.\n\nIn essence, this verse encourages us to perform acts of kindness and generosity without expecting anything in return, as true benevolence is selfless and unconditional. It is a reminder that the act of giving should be its own reward..The kural verse:தாளாற்றித் தந்த பொருளெல்லாம் தக்கார்க்குவேளாண்மை செய்தற் பொருட்டு. ,translates to :All the wealth that toils give  Is meant to serve those who deserve,and it's explantion is :Kural 212 emphasizes the moral responsibility of wealth distribution. It suggests that all the wealth one acquires through diligent efforts and perseverance should primarily serve a philanthropic purpose. The verse encourages the wealthy to exercise benevolence and generosity, stating that the true purpose of wealth is to aid those who are worthy and in need.\n\nThe verse implies that wealth is not just for personal consumption or enjoyment, but it should be used to uplift others, especially those who are disadvantaged or less fortunate. The wealth acquired is not meant to be hoarded, but to be utilized for the betterment of society. It advocates the practice of charity and sees it as a moral duty of the affluent.\n\nIn a broader sense, the Kural encourages the redistribution of wealth and resources in society, to reduce inequality and to promote social justice. It underpins the idea of 'giving back' to the society that contributed to one's success. The verse suggests that the act of sharing one's wealth not only benefits the receiver but also adds value and purpose to the wealth itself. \n\nThe Kural, therefore, promotes a balanced and equitable society where the needs of the less fortunate are taken care of by the more fortunate. It aligns with the traditional Indian philosophy of 'Dana' or charity, which is considered one of the highest virtues. \n\nThis verse also reflects the egalitarian values embedded in Tamil culture, where wealth is viewed not as a symbol of personal success, but as a means for communal welfare and prosperity..The kural verse:புத்தே ளுலகத்தும் ஈண்டும் பெறலரிதேஒப்புரவின் நல்ல பிற. ,translates to :In heav'n and earth 'tis hard to find  A greater good than being kind,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural (Kural 213) speaks to the virtue of benevolence and the act of helping others, terming it as 'opuravu'. It emphasizes that benevolence is a superior virtue that is hard to match, either in our current worldly life or in the divine realm. \n\nThe verse is a powerful reminder of the significance and value placed on compassion and kindness in Tamil culture and philosophy. It implies that being helpful and kind to others, especially to those who are less fortunate or struggle, is an act of nobility that surpasses other good deeds. \n\nMoreover, the verse also subtly hints at the concept of karma, suggesting that benevolent acts performed in this life could have positive implications in the divine life, or afterlife. The use of the term 'world of gods' could be a reference to the afterlife or the divine realm, where the fruits of one's good actions in this life are believed to be reaped. \n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse encourages individuals to cultivate a spirit of generosity and selflessness, emphasizing that acts of benevolence are of great worth and hard to equal in both the earthly and divine realms. Thus, the verse underscores the universal value of kindness and compassion, enriching the moral fabric of society..The kural verse:ஒத்த தறவோன் உயிர்வாழ்வான் மற்றையான்செத்தாருள் வைக்கப் படும். ,translates to :He lives who knows befitting act  Others are deemed as dead in fact,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of benevolence, compassion, and the performance of one's duties towards others. It suggests that a person truly lives when he or she understands and executes the duties of benevolence, such as helping others and contributing positively to society. In doing so, they enrich their life and the lives of others, making their existence meaningful and worthwhile.\n\nOn the contrary, those who are ignorant of such duties or choose not to perform them, despite being physically alive, are considered as good as dead. They are likened to the dead because they fail to fulfill the fundamental purpose of human life, which includes showing kindness, compassion, and aiding those in need.\n\nIn essence, the verse is a stark reminder of the significance of benevolence in life. It encourages us to lead a life characterized by empathy and goodwill towards others, emphasizing that true living is not just about existing but about making a positive difference in the lives of others. The verse also implies a moral judgement, stating that those who do not help others are as good as dead, underscoring the moral obligation mankind has towards each other..The kural verse:ஊருணி நீர்நிறைந் தற்றே உலகவாம்பேரறி வாளன் திரு. ,translates to :The wealth that wise and kind do make  Is like water that fills a lake,and it's explantion is :Kural 215 offers a profound analogy to explain the nature of a wise person's wealth. It suggests that the wealth of an enlightened individual who wishes to practice universal benevolence is like a city's reservoir filled with water. \n\nThe city reservoir or 'ooruni' is a public resource that benefits all inhabitants of the city, regardless of their individual contributions to it. Similarly, the wealth of a wise and benevolent person is not hoarded for personal gain, but rather, it overflows for the benefit of all. \n\nThis Kural emphasizes the societal role and responsibility of those who possess wealth. It suggests that wealth is not merely a personal asset, but a resource that should be used for the welfare of all, particularly by those with the wisdom and knowledge to use it effectively.\n\nThe Kural also highlights the virtue of generosity and the importance of using wealth for societal benefit. It encourages wealthy individuals to utilize their resources in a way that is 'approved by the world', in other words, in a manner that is ethical, fair, and beneficial to all.\n\nIn this way, Thiruvalluvar uses a simple and relatable analogy to impart a timeless moral teaching on wealth management and social responsibility..The kural verse:பயன்மரம் உள்ளூர்ப் பழுத்தற்றால் செல்வம்நயனுடை யான்கண் படின். ,translates to :Who plenty gets and plenty gives  Is like town-tree teeming with fruits,and it's explantion is :Kural 216 emphasizes the virtue of benevolence and how wealth in the hands of a benevolent person can be beneficial to everyone, just like a fruit-bearing tree in the middle of a town. \n\nThe analogy of a fruitful tree in the middle of a town is used to represent the wealth of a benevolent person. A fruit tree in the midst of a town doesn't discriminate who eats its fruits. It equally provides for everyone who reaches out to it, regardless of their status or need. Similarly, a person who is kind-hearted and generous uses his wealth for the welfare of all, irrespective of their standing in society. Such a person's wealth is not just for personal consumption but serves as a resource for the entire community.\n\nThis verse thus underscores the power of benevolence and kindness. It suggests that wealth, when combined with a generous heart, can become a source of communal good. It promotes the idea of wealth being used for charitable and philanthropic purposes, benefiting the wider society, and not just being hoarded for personal gain. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, through this verse, is advocating for the responsible and compassionate use of wealth, emphasizing that benevolence combined with affluence can lead to widespread benefits..The kural verse:மருந்தாகித் தப்பா மரத்தற்றால் செல்வம்பெருந்தகை யான்கண் படின். ,translates to :The wealth of a wide-hearted soul  Is a herbal tree that healeth all,and it's explantion is :Kural 217 emphasizes on the combination of wealth and benevolence. The verse suggests that when wealth is in the possession of a person who is inherently benevolent and noble, it is akin to a medicinal tree that provides infallible cures for diseases. \n\nThe comparison of wealth to a 'medicinal tree' is significant. Just as every part of the medicinal tree – be it leaves, roots, bark, or fruits – can be used to cure various diseases and bring health, similarly, when wealth is with a benevolent person, it can be used to alleviate the suffering of others, bring joy, and make a significant positive impact on the society.\n\nThe verse highlights the social responsibility of the wealthy. It suggests that wealth, when coupled with benevolence, can serve as a tool for social good, and not just personal luxury. In essence, the verse implores those with wealth to use it as a means for helping others, just like a medicinal tree that provides relief and cure to all. \n\nTherefore, this kural promotes the virtue of generosity and public-spiritedness, urging the wealthy to use their resources for the greater good..The kural verse:இடனில் பருவத்தும் ஒப்புரவிற்கு ஒல்கார்கடனறி காட்சி யவர். ,translates to :Though seers may fall on evil days  Their sense of duty never strays,and it's explantion is :The Kural 218 suggests that those who have a deep understanding of their moral duties and responsibilities will not withhold their generosity, even when they find themselves in times of financial hardship. This verse emphasizes the importance of maintaining our benevolence, kindness, and willingness to help others, regardless of our own circumstances. \n\nIn other words, true wisdom lies not just in the knowledge of what our duties are, but also in the unwavering commitment to fulfilling these duties, even in the face of adversity. The wise, as per this verse, do not let their financial status dictate their kindness or their ability to help those in need. \n\nThe essence of this verse is that moral responsibility transcends material wealth. Regardless of our financial situation, we should always be ready and willing to extend our help and kindness to those in need. This principle is a cornerstone in many cultures and philosophies, emphasizing compassion, altruism, and the importance of helping others as a moral duty..The kural verse:நயனுடையான் நல்கூர்ந்தா னாதல் செயும்நீரசெய்யாது அமைகலா வாறு. ,translates to :The good man's poverty and grief  Is want of means to give relief,and it's explantion is :Kural 219 speaks about the nature of benevolent individuals who are deeply moved by the suffering of others and feel it their duty to assist in alleviating such distress. The verse suggests that the true poverty of these individuals lies not in their lack of material wealth, but in their inability to help others due to their circumstances. \n\nIn other words, the real deprivation for a kind-hearted person is the incapacity to act on their inherent generosity and provide aid to those in need. This inability to exercise their benevolence, due to their own lack of resources, is what causes these individuals the most distress, rather than the poverty itself. \n\nThe verse gives us a profound insight into the value system of such individuals, where the act of giving and helping is seen as more important and fulfilling than material possessions. It highlights the universal moral principle of compassion and empathy, emphasizing that the true measure of a person's wealth is not what they have, but what they can give to others. \n\nHence, the verse encourages us to cultivate and value the qualities of kindness and generosity, reminding us that the inability to help others in need is the real poverty..The kural verse:ஒப்புரவி னால்வரும் கேடெனின் அஃதொருவன்விற்றுக்கோள் தக்க துடைத்து. ,translates to :By good if ruin comes across  Sell yourself to save that loss,and it's explantion is :Kural 220 emphasizes the value of benevolence, even in the face of potential loss. According to this verse, if it is suggested that being kind and generous can lead to loss, such loss is considered valuable enough to be acquired even by selling oneself. This statement signifies the importance of selflessness and altruism in Tamil ethical philosophy. \n\nThe verse suggests that the detriment born out of benevolence is highly esteemed, it is worth acquiring even at the cost of one's own self. This metaphorical 'sale of oneself' symbolizes the ultimate sacrifice one can make for the sake of others, underscoring the moral virtue of selflessness.\n\nIn essence, the verse celebrates the nobility of benevolence and self-sacrifice, asserting that any loss incurred through acts of kindness and generosity is actually a gain of enormous moral value. It underscores the principle that the true worth of an individual lies not in personal wealth or possessions, but in their willingness to help others, even to their own detriment..The kural verse:வறியார்க்கொன்று ஈவதே ஈகைமற் றெல்லாம்குறியெதிர்ப்பை நீர துடைத்து. ,translates to :To give the poor is charity  The rest is loan and vanity,and it's explantion is :Kural 221 emphasizes the true essence of charity. It states that genuine charity is when one gives to those who are in dire need, the destitute, without expecting anything in return. This act of giving is born out of compassion and empathy for the less fortunate and is considered the highest form of charity.\n\nOn the other hand, the kural suggests that any other form of giving, which expects some form of measured return or is done with an ulterior motive, is not true charity. These acts of giving, while not inherently bad, are often driven by self-interest or a desire for reciprocity. They might be forms of trade or investment rather than genuine acts of charity.\n\nThis verse, therefore, encourages altruistic giving and highlights the importance of selflessness in charity. It urges us to help the needy without any expectation of reward or return, embodying the principle of unconditional love and kindness. It forms a significant part of the ethical and moral teachings of Thiru Kural..The kural verse:நல்லாறு எனினும் கொளல்தீது மேலுலகம்இல்லெனினும் ஈதலே நன்று. ,translates to :To beg is bad e'en from the good  To give is good, were heaven forbid,and it's explantion is :Kural 222 beautifully encapsulates the concept of selflessness and the virtue of giving. It essentially says that begging, even if it is said to be a virtuous path leading to heaven, is still considered a lowly act. The act of begging is seen as a degradation of one's dignity and self-respect. It emphasizes the idea that relying on oneself for survival is of greater nobility than depending on others' charity.\n\nOn the other hand, the verse extols the act of giving, even if it is said that such an act might not lead to heaven. According to this verse, the act of giving, of being charitable, and helping those in need is the highest virtue, regardless of whether or not it leads to an afterlife reward. This is indicative of the selfless nature of giving, where the act is done out of genuine concern and compassion for others, and not for any personal gain or benefit.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse teaches us the importance of self-reliance and compassion. It encourages us to be self-sufficient and to uphold our dignity, while also emphasizing the need to be generous and kind to others. It highlights that the act of giving is a virtue in itself, irrespective of any potential rewards or punishments in the afterlife. The verse promotes the concept of altruism and selflessness, which are fundamental values in many cultures and religions. \n\nThus, Thirukkural 222 encourages us to seek self-reliance, dignity, and compassion in our lives, promoting a selfless and giving society..The kural verse:இலனென்னும் எவ்வம் உரையாமை ஈதல்குலனுடையான் கண்ணே யுள. ,translates to :No pleading, \\\"I am nothing worth,\\\"  But giving marks a noble birth,and it's explantion is :Kural 223 emphasizes the virtues of generosity and dignity, particularly among those who come from noble families or high social standing. The verse suggests that regardless of one's financial circumstances, one should never resort to declaring their poverty or lack thereof to others. Instead, they should continue to give and help others to the best of their ability. It highlights that one's nobility is not measured by wealth, but by their ability to maintain dignity in adversity and the readiness to help others even when in need. \n\nThe verse reflects the cultural values in Tamil society, where nobility is not just a matter of birth or wealth, but also a matter of character and conduct. It urges us to resist the temptation to bemoan our hardships or use them as an excuse not to help others. Rather, we should strive to uphold our dignity and generosity regardless of our personal circumstances.\n\nThis Kural also sheds light on an important aspect of human behavior - altruism. It states that the act of giving, even in the face of adversity, is a true mark of a person born into a noble family. Hence, it encourages the reader not only to maintain dignity and resilience in the face of hardship but also to uphold the virtue of generosity, regardless of personal circumstances..The kural verse:இன்னாது இரக்கப் படுதல் இரந்தவர்இன்முகங் காணும் அளவு. ,translates to :The cry for alms is painful sight  Until the giver sees him bright,and it's explantion is :Kural 224 emphasizes the discomfort experienced by generous individuals when they are approached by others for aid. This kural implies that the act of begging is painful and disagreeable to the givers, until they see the receivers' faces light up with gratitude and relief.\n\nThe first part of the verse, \"To see men begging from us is disagreeable\", refers to the discomfort felt by a person who is approached for assistance. This discomfort might arise out of a variety of reasons such as a sense of obligation, inconvenience, or the fear of being taken advantage of.\n\nThe second part of the verse, \"until we see their pleasant countenance\", reveals the transformative power of gratitude. The act of giving becomes a source of joy when it is received with gratitude, as it manifests the positive impact of their generosity. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, through this verse, underscores the moral responsibility of individuals to aid those in need, despite any initial discomfort, keeping in mind the eventual pleasure derived from the act of giving. The verse also highlights the importance of gratitude in the act of receiving, as it not only eases the giver's discomfort but also adds value to their act of generosity..The kural verse:ஆற்றுவார் ஆற்றல் பசிஆற்றல் அப்பசியைமாற்றுவார் ஆற்றலின் பின். ,translates to :Higher's power which hunger cures  Than that of penance which endures,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural highlights the moral superiority of charity and selflessness over personal discipline and austerity. Thiruvalluvar, the author, asserts that the power attained through personal penance, which includes enduring one's own hunger, is indeed commendable. However, this power is secondary when compared to the act of alleviating the hunger of others.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that self-denial and personal discipline, while being noble virtues, are outdone by acts of generosity that aim at relieving the suffering of others. The 'power' mentioned in this verse could be interpreted as moral strength or spiritual advancement. \n\nIn a cultural context, this verse underscores the importance of altruism and charity in Tamil society. It encourages us to look beyond our personal spiritual practices and to extend our kindness and resources to those in need. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar suggests that the act of giving food to a hungry person is superior to personal austerity or penance. This is a potent reminder of the importance of compassion and generosity in building a just and empathetic society..The kural verse:அற்றார் அழிபசி தீர்த்தல் அஃதொருவன்பெற்றான் பொருள்வைப் புழி. ,translates to :Drive from the poor their gnawing pains  If room you seek to store your gains,and it's explantion is :The Kural 226, as written by the great sage Thiruvalluvar, emphasizes the importance of helping the less fortunate. This verse advocates that the most valuable way to utilize one's wealth is by alleviating the hunger of those in need.\n\nThe verse uses the metaphor of 'killing hunger' to depict the intensity of poverty and starvation faced by some individuals. This 'killing hunger' can be interpreted as a state of extreme need, where the lack of food threatens a person's very survival. The verse suggests that it is the moral responsibility of those who are wealthy or have surplus resources, to dispel this extreme hunger and help the needy.\n\nMoreover, Thiruvalluvar also suggests that the act of helping the poor is not only a moral duty but also a form of investment. The wealth used in such a manner is not wasted, but rather 'laid up', implying that it holds value for the future. This can be understood in two ways: either as a spiritual belief where good deeds result in good karma, or as a social investment where alleviating poverty can lead to a healthier, more prosperous society.\n\nThus, this verse encourages us to view wealth not merely as a personal possession but as a tool for social betterment. It motivates us to be compassionate and generous, and to use our resources wisely in the service of those less fortunate..The kural verse:பாத்தூண் மரீஇ யவனைப் பசியென்னும்தீப்பிணி தீண்டல் அரிது. ,translates to :Who shares his food with those who need  Hunger shall not harm his creed,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse, 227, emphasizes the virtue of sharing and generosity, particularly in the context of food. The verse suggests that a person who routinely shares their food with others will never be touched by the painful affliction of hunger. This can be understood in two ways - literally and metaphorically. \n\nOn a literal level, the verse speaks about the physical act of sharing food. In many cultures, sharing food is seen as a fundamental act of kindness and community. By sharing food with others, not only does one ensure the wellbeing of others, but also creates a network of reciprocity and mutual care that can safeguard against future scarcity.\n\nOn a metaphorical level, the 'fiery disease of hunger' can also be interpreted as any kind of deprivation or need. The act of sharing then becomes a broader metaphor for generosity and altruism. When one is generous in sharing their resources (be it food, wealth, knowledge or time), they are less likely to experience deprivation themselves. This is because the act of giving creates a cycle of goodwill and positive karma that comes back to benefit the giver.\n\nTherefore, the essence of this verse is the promotion of a generous and sharing attitude, for it not only benefits the recipient but also provides a safety net for the giver. This verse also reinforces the moral value of empathy and consideration for the needs of others..The kural verse:ஈத்துவக்கும் இன்பம் அறியார்கொல் தாமுடைமைவைத்திழக்கும் வன்க ணவர். ,translates to :The joy of give and take they lose  Hard-hearted rich whose hoarding fails,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural, written by the ancient Tamil philosopher Thiruvalluvar, highlights the joy of giving and criticizes those who hoard wealth and subsequently lose it without ever experiencing the pleasure of generosity.\n\nIn this verse, Thiruvalluvar is questioning if the individuals, who hoard their possessions and ultimately lose them without sharing with the less fortunate, are aware of the happiness that arises from the act of giving. The term 'hard-eyed' is used to describe such individuals who are unsympathetic and lack compassion towards the needy.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of charity and the joy that comes from it. It also subtly suggests the transient nature of material possessions, which can be lost at any time. Therefore, it is better to derive happiness through acts of charity and kindness, rather than hoarding wealth.\n\nThe verse also serves as a social commentary, highlighting the selfishness of those who amass wealth without considering the needs of the less fortunate. It underscores the idea that the true worth of wealth lies not in its accumulation, but in its distribution to those in need.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar advocates for the practice of generosity, stating that the joy derived from giving to others surpasses the fleeting satisfaction gained from hoarding wealth. He urges individuals to comprehend the impermanent nature of wealth and the enduring satisfaction that comes from acts of giving..The kural verse:இரத்தலின் இன்னாது மன்ற நிரப்பியதாமே தமியர் உணல். ,translates to :Worse than begging is that boarding  Alone what one's greed is hoarding,and it's explantion is :Kural 229 is a profound verse that emphasizes the importance of generosity and the perils of miserliness. The verse says, \"Eating alone and not sharing, just for the sake of amassing wealth, is a misery far worse than begging.\"\n\nIn this verse, Valluvar, the author, criticizes the act of hoarding wealth and resources out of fear of poverty, without sharing with others. He argues that such an act is even worse than begging. The verse implies that hoarding out of fear of poverty leads to a kind of spiritual poverty, which is worse than material poverty.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the verse champions the virtue of sharing and generosity. It underscores the idea that wealth and resources should be used not just for one's own benefit, but for the benefit of others as well. This reflects the societal values of the Tamil community during Valluvar's time, where sharing and generosity were highly valued.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can also be seen as a critique of greed and selfishness. The act of hoarding and not sharing, according to Valluvar, results in isolation and misery. This verse encourages us to be mindful of our actions and their impact on others and urges us to cultivate a spirit of generosity and sharing..The kural verse:சாதலின் இன்னாத தில்லை இனிததூஉம்ஈதல் இயையாக் கடை. ,translates to :Nothing is more painful than death  Yet more is pain of giftless dearth,and it's explantion is :Kural 230 is a profound statement on the importance of charity and the pain of not being able to exercise it. The verse suggests that while death is generally considered to be the most unpleasant occurrence in life, there is something even more painful and distressing - the inability to provide charity or aid to those in need.\n\nThe first half of the verse, \"Nothing is more unpleasant than death,\" sets the tone by stating the universally accepted truth that death is the most unwelcome event. The second half, however, introduces a thought-provoking idea. It states, \"yet even that (death) is pleasant where charity cannot be exercised.\" This implies that for a person who values charity and the act of giving, not being able to help the needy is a fate worse than death. \n\nThis verse underscores the significance of charity in human life and society. It also speaks to the deep sorrow and helplessness one may feel when they are unable to extend help to those in need, suggesting that such a state could be more distressing than death itself. \n\nIn essence, Kural 230 encapsulates the essence of altruism, emphasizing the joy in giving and the pain in being unable to do so. It drives forth the point that the inability to give, to extend a helping hand, is a painful state, perhaps even more painful than death itself..The kural verse:ஈதல் இசைபட வாழ்தல் அதுவல்லதுஊதியம் இல்லை உயிர்க்கு. ,translates to :They gather fame who freely give  The greatest gain for all that live,and it's explantion is :Kural 231 emphasizes the profound significance of generosity, particularly in the context of aiding those in need. The verse states that giving to the impoverished and thereby living a life of commendation is the highest gain one can achieve in life. There is no wealth or reward greater than this for a human being.\n\nThe verse underscores the concept that the act of giving, especially to those less fortunate, not only benefits the receiver but also ennobles the giver. It brings praise and respect to the giver, enhancing their status in society. This act of charity, coupled with the accompanying praise, is presented as the greatest profit or benefit that one can attain in life.\n\nThe moral interpretation of this verse aligns with the fundamental tenets of many cultures and religions, which uphold charity and generosity as virtuous deeds. Moreover, the verse subtly reminds us of our social responsibilities and the importance of empathy and compassion towards the less fortunate.\n\nIn essence, Kural 231 extols the virtue of altruism, highlighting that living a life of praise through charitable acts is the most rewarding and fulfilling achievement one can aspire to. It encourages us to give generously and live a life that is both praised and respected, asserting that there is no greater gain or asset in life than this..The kural verse:உரைப்பார் உரைப்பவை எல்லாம் இரப்பார்க்கொன்றுஈவார்மேல் நிற்கும் புகழ். ,translates to :The glory of the alms-giver  Is praised aloud as popular,and it's explantion is :Kural 232 speaks about the virtue of charity, particularly towards those who are in need. It highlights the endearing social respect and praise that a charitable person earns in the society.\n\nThis verse implies that whatever is spoken in the world, all the praises and commendations, will eventually be attributed to the person who generously gives to the poor. The act of giving, especially to those who are lacking, is seen as a noble deed, earning the person a high degree of esteem and admiration in the society.\n\nThe phrase \"abide as praise upon that man\" emphasizes that such praise is not transient but remains with the person, enhancing their reputation and honor. This verse, therefore, encourages the act of giving, underscoring its value not only for the receiver but also for the giver in terms of the respect and admiration they gain.\n\nIn essence, this verse suggests that charity is a virtue that is highly valued and appreciated in society, and those who practice it are held in high esteem. It encourages individuals to be generous and kind, particularly to those in need, as it not only helps alleviate their suffering but also earns the giver enduring praise and respect in the society..The kural verse:ஒன்றா உலகத்து உயர்ந்த புகழல்லால்பொன்றாது நிற்பதொன் றில். ,translates to :Nothing else lasts on earth for e'er  Saving high fame of the giver!,and it's explantion is :The Kural 233, in essence, emphasizes the enduring and unparalleled value of a good reputation or fame. This verse underscores the fact that everything in this world is transient and will eventually perish, except for one's fame that stands tall, unyielding, and singular in its greatness.\n\nThe Kural uses the metaphor of standing forth in the world, suggesting that fame, once achieved, is visible and recognized by all. It's something that cannot be taken away, unlike material possessions that can be lost or erode over time. The reputation you gain through your good deeds and character is the only thing that remains steadfast and unchanging, even after you are gone.\n\nThis verse also implies the importance one should place on earning a good reputation. The lasting and imperishable nature of fame should motivate individuals to strive towards actions that earn them respect and admiration. In other words, the pursuit of a good name should be seen as a pursuit of immortality. \n\nThe cultural context of this verse is rooted in the traditional Indian emphasis on \"Dharma\" or virtuous living, where a person's moral and ethical standing in society is considered of paramount importance. This Kural, thereby, is a reminder to prioritize moral integrity and virtuous actions that would lead to an enduring, positive reputation..The kural verse:நிலவரை நீள்புகழ் ஆற்றின் புலவரைப்போற்றாது புத்தேள் உலகு. ,translates to :From hailing gods heavens will cease  To hail the men of lasting praise,and it's explantion is :The Kural 234 emphasizes the importance and value of a good reputation earned in the earthly world. The verse suggests that if one has managed to acquire extensive fame in the confines of this earth, their reputation will exceed even those of the sages revered in the divine realm. This is because the fame and recognition gained through virtuous deeds, good character, and contributions to society in the earthly world are more significant and enduring.\n\nThe verse implicitly argues that the admiration of the earthly world is superior to that of the divine realm. It implies that it is more commendable to be celebrated by the beings of the earthly world, who directly experience and benefit from your actions, than to be praised in a realm that is detached from day-to-day human experiences. \n\nThe verse also emphasizes the idea that the values of righteousness, virtue, and benevolence are universally recognized and appreciated, regardless of the realm. It encourages individuals to strive for excellence and virtue in their earthly lives, as their reputation will resonate even in the divine world. \n\nIn essence, the verse suggests that the true measure of a person's greatness is the positive impact they have on the world and the legacy they leave behind, not just their spiritual attainments..The kural verse:நத்தம்போல் கேடும் உளதாகும் சாக்காடும்வித்தகர்க் கல்லால் அரிது. ,translates to :Fame in fall and life in death  Are rare but for the soulful worth,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse advocates the importance of fostering a robust reputation, or 'body of fame', even at the expense of one's physical well-being, or 'body of flesh'. It highlights that enduring hardships and overcoming challenges, to uphold one's honor and dignity, is a quality possessed by the wise alone. \n\nThe verse asserts that only those with wisdom can convert their physical struggles into the wealth of reputation. Furthermore, it emphasizes that only the wise are capable of ensuring that their fame or good name remains undiminished, even after their physical death. \n\nThis verse essentially advises that one's fame or reputation, which outlives the physical body, should be preserved and enhanced even in the face of adversity. This, according to the verse, is an attribute of the truly wise and cannot be achieved by everyone.\n\nIn a nutshell, the verse suggests that wisdom involves valuing one's reputation over physical comfort and ensuring its preservation beyond physical life. This is a challenging task that can only be accomplished by those with true wisdom and understanding..The kural verse:தோன்றின் புகழொடு தோன்றுக அஃதிலார்தோன்றலின் தோன்றாமை நன்று. ,translates to :Be born with fame if birth you want  If not of birth you must not vaunt,and it's explantion is :This verse of Thirukkural emphasizes the importance of living a life that brings fame and respect due to good qualities and noble deeds. It suggests that if one is to be born into this world, they should strive to possess such qualities that bring about respect and admiration from others. In other words, one's existence should be marked by noteworthy accomplishments and virtuous conduct that earns them fame and recognition.\n\nOn the contrary, it states that for those who lack these desirable traits, it would be better not to be born at all. This is not a morbid suggestion, but rather a strong admonition against living a life devoid of purpose, value, or respect. It underscores the belief that life should not merely be lived, but lived well, with dignity, purpose, and a positive influence on others.\n\nThe verse encompasses an important life lesson - one should always aim to improve, contribute positively to society and live a life that is worthy of respect and admiration. Otherwise, their existence, devoid of any meaningful impact, is questioned. It encourages an individual to strive for personal betterment and societal contribution, making their life worthwhile and significant. \n\nIn essence, the verse urges one to lead a life that is not just about existence but about making a difference, achieving fame through good deeds, and leaving a positive footprint on the sands of time..The kural verse:புகழ்பட வாழாதார் தந்நோவார் தம்மைஇகழ்வாரை நோவது எவன்? ,translates to :Why grieve at those who blame the shame  Of those who cannot live in fame?,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse questions the logic of those who are unable to live a life that earns them genuine praise, yet show their resentment towards those who scorn them. Instead, it suggests that they should feel sorrow for their own shortcomings that prevent them from achieving a praiseworthy life.\n\nThe verse implies that the true cause of their desolation is not the scorn of others, but their own inability to live a commendable life that could earn them praise. They should, therefore, focus on self-improvement and personal growth rather than wasting energy on resenting their critics.\n\nThis verse suggests that individuals should take criticism as an opportunity for introspection and self-improvement, rather than as a cause for resentment. It emphasizes on personal accountability and self-reflection, and encourages individuals to strive for a life that is worthy of praise, rather than feeling grieved by the scorn of others. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse encapsulates the concept of personal responsibility and the importance of self-improvement, and encourages individuals to focus on their own actions and attitudes rather than external criticism. It underscores the idea that we have control over our own actions and should strive to live a life that is worthy of admiration and respect..The kural verse:வசையென்ப வையத்தார்க் கெல்லாம் இசையென்னும்எச்சம் பெறாஅ விடின். ,translates to :To men on earth it is a shame  Not to beget the child of fame,and it's explantion is :Kural 238 emphasizes the importance of earning repute or fame for oneself. It states that failure to acquire a good name and fame that would endure even after one's life is considered a disgrace by the wise in the world. \n\nIn the context of ancient Tamil culture and society, fame was seen as a testament to one's deeds, character, and accomplishments. It was perceived as a valuable asset that one leaves behind, influencing future generations. \n\nThe verse implies that one's life should be lived in such a way that it brings honor and positive recognition, not just for the individual, but also for their lineage. It urges individuals to strive for actions that would lead to lasting fame. If one fails to do so, the life lived would be considered fruitless and dishonorable by the wise and the world at large.\n\nIt's a call to live a life of value, purpose, and honor, making a positive impact, and leaving a legacy of good deeds. It's a reminder that the world remembers and respects those who have lived a life worthy of praise and emulation..The kural verse:வசையிலா வண்பயன் குன்றும் இசையிலாயாக்கை பொறுத்த நிலம். ,translates to :The land will shrink in yield if men  O'erburden it without renown,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse, Kural 239, conveys the moral importance of fame and reputation in a person's life. The verse metaphorically relates a person's fame to the fertility of the soil.\n\nThe verse suggests that the earth itself disapproves of bearing the burden of a person who has lived a life without earning any recognition or fame. Just as the fertility of the soil diminishes when it is utilized for non-productive purposes, the worth of the ground that accepts the body of a fameless person will also diminish.\n\nIn essence, the Kural emphasizes the importance of living a life that gains respect and recognition from others. It encourages individuals to strive for achievements and contributions that make a positive difference in the world, thereby earning fame and admiration. If not, their life is considered as barren and unproductive as infertile soil.\n\nThis verse reflects the ancient Tamil value system that highly regarded fame and honor achieved through virtues and good deeds. It is also a reminder of the impermanence and vanity of physical existence when compared to the lasting legacy of one's deeds and reputation..The kural verse:வசையொழிய வாழ்வாரே வாழ்வார் இசையொழியவாழ்வாரே வாழா தவர். ,translates to :They live who live without blemish  The blameful ones do not flurish,and it's explantion is :Kural 240 posits the importance of a life led with honor and fame. It suggests that the essence of life is not just in living, but in living honorably, free from disgrace or dishonor. This can be interpreted as the importance of maintaining one's reputation and dignity. Reputation, in this context, is not about gaining worldly fame or popularity, but about earning the respect of others through virtuous actions and good character.\n\nThe second part of the verse emphasizes the insignificance of a life lived without fame. Again, \"fame\" here should not be understood in a superficial sense. It does not refer to the fleeting fame gained through vanity or materialistic pursuits, but the lasting recognition and respect that comes from leading a virtuous life. \n\nIn essence, this verse highlights the significance of living a life of integrity and virtue, which earns one respect and recognition. It asserts that a life marred by disgrace or devoid of moral recognition is, in effect, a life not lived to its fullest potential. This verse encourages us to strive for a life of virtue, where respect and honor define our existence, rather than a life of shame or anonymity..The kural verse:அருட்செல்வம் செல்வத்துள் செல்வம் பொருட்செல்வம்பூரியார் கண்ணும் உள. ,translates to :The wealth of wealth is wealth of grace  Earthly wealth e'en the basest has,and it's explantion is :Kural 241 emphasizes the importance of kindness as a form of wealth. It suggests that material wealth can be possessed by anyone, including individuals of poor character. However, the wealth of kindness or compassion, which is referred to as \"arut selva\" in the verse, is a superior form of wealth. This unique wealth is not easily obtainable by everyone, specifically those who lack a good heart.\n\nThis verse highlights the moral superiority of kindness over material wealth. It implies that while material wealth can provide comfort and luxury, it does not necessarily make a person better. On the other hand, kindness enhances one's character and uplifts their moral standing. Hence, kindness is considered the 'wealth of wealth' as it is the most valuable asset a person can possess.\n\nThe verse teaches us that material wealth does not define a person's worth or character. It is the wealth of kindness and compassion that truly elevates a person, making them rich in the truest sense. This Kural encourages us to strive for spiritual wealth over material wealth, emphasizing the importance of inner virtues over outer possessions..The kural verse:நல்லாற்றாள் நாடி அருளாள்க பல்லாற்றால்தேரினும் அஃதே துணை. ,translates to :Seek by sound ways good compassion;  All faiths mark that for-salvation,and it's explantion is :Kural 242 speaks about the importance of kindness and the path of good deeds in life. It emphasizes that regardless of different philosophical views or religious beliefs, kindness remains the fundamental and universal virtue that aids in the pursuit of a meaningful and fulfilling life.\n\nThe verse advises individuals to walk on the path of righteousness, to deliberate on their actions, and to lead a life filled with benevolence. It suggests that even if one were to consider diverse doctrines or principles, kindness or compassion would still emerge as the most supportive guide in life's journey. \n\nThis Kural underlines that the act of loving-kindness transcends all religious, cultural, or philosophical differences. It is the universal principle that forms the core of human ethics. No matter what beliefs or ideologies one may hold, the practice of kindness is a universally accepted virtue that enriches life and leads to spiritual fulfillment.\n\nIn essence, this Kural encourages individuals to embrace kindness as a way of life, emphasizing its significance as a guiding principle in all walks of life, irrespective of varying beliefs or ideologies..The kural verse:அருள்சேர்ந்த நெஞ்சினார்க் கில்லை இருள்சேர்ந்தஇன்னா உலகம் புகல். ,translates to :The hearts of mercy shall not go  Into dark worlds of gruesome woe,and it's explantion is :This couplet (Kural 243) illustrates the importance of compassion and kindness in one's life. It says that those who have a heart filled with kindness and compassion will never succumb to a world of ignorance, symbolized here as darkness. This darkness also represents a state of suffering and distress, implying that a kind heart is a shield against hardships and struggles.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that compassion is not merely an admirable quality, but a powerful tool that helps individuals to navigate through the challenges of life while remaining untouched by its negative aspects. By harboring kindness, one can avoid being engulfed in the darkness of ignorance and misery, and instead, lead a life of enlightenment and happiness.\n\nIn a broader cultural context, this verse resonates with the major philosophical and moral teachings of the Tamil culture, which places great emphasis on virtues like kindness, compassion, and empathy. It embodies the belief that these virtues have the power to protect individuals from adversity and guide them towards a path of wisdom and bliss. In essence, the verse teaches us that kindness is a key that unlocks a life of light, wisdom, and joy..The kural verse:மன்னுயிர் ஓம்பி அருளாள்வார்க்கு இல்லென்பதன்னுயிர் அஞ்சும் வினை. ,translates to :His soul is free from dread of sins  Whose mercy serveth all beings,and it's explantion is :Kural 244 emphasizes the principle of compassion and kindness towards all living beings. The verse suggests that a person who is kind-hearted and protective of all lives will not encounter harm or danger that would invoke fear for his own life. \n\nFrom a deeper perspective, this verse teaches us the universal law of cause and effect, also known as Karma. It suggests that the positive actions we perform, such as showing kindness and protection towards other lives, will result in positive outcomes for us. \n\nOn another level, it also advocates the principle of non-violence and respect towards all forms of life, a common tenet in many spiritual and philosophical traditions. The act of caring and protecting other lives is not just a moral duty, but also a way to ensure our own well-being.\n\nIn a nutshell, this verse encourages us to live harmoniously with all beings, emphasizing that in doing so, we create a protective shield around us, warding off dangers and fears that could potentially harm us..The kural verse:அல்லல் அருளாள்வார்க்கு இல்லை வளிவழங்கும்மல்லன்மா ஞாலங் கரி. ,translates to :The wide wind-fed world witness bears:  Men of mercy meet not sorrows,and it's explantion is :This Kural 245 emphasizes the virtue of kindness. Thiruvalluvar, the poet, reflects that those who are filled with compassion and kindness never encounter sorrow. The earth, rich and bountiful, swept by the wind, stands as a testament to this fact. \n\nThe verse metaphorically uses the image of the earth to depict the benevolent. Just like the earth, that is generous in providing resources to all creatures, a kind-hearted person is also generous and compassionate towards others. And just as the earth does not suffer from the winds that sweep across it, a kind-hearted person does not suffer from sorrows. \n\nThis verse asserts that kindness shields people from miseries. It encourages the practice of kindness, emphasizing that leading a life filled with compassion and love leads to a life devoid of sorrow. The moral interpretation of this verse is the universal principle that good deeds, like kindness, are rewarded with happiness and peace. \n\nIn cultural context, this verse upholds the quintessential Tamil virtue of 'Arul' or kindness. The poet states that the world itself stands as a proof to the truth that those who live with kindness and love, live without encountering any sorrow..The kural verse:பொருள்நீங்கிப் பொச்சாந்தார் என்பர் அருள்நீங்கிஅல்லவை செய்தொழுகு வார். ,translates to :Who grace forsake and graceless act  The former loss and woes forget,and it's explantion is :Kural 246 speaks about the moral law of cause and effect, often referred to as karma in the Indian philosophical context. The verse suggests that those who are unkind and indulge in harmful actions are people who have forgotten the virtuous path from their previous life and ignored the consequences of their actions.\n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes that a lack of compassion and engagement in cruel deeds are signs of a person's ignorance or neglect of moral values. According to the sage Valluvar, such people have not only lost their wealth (symbolic of their moral wealth) but also have forgotten their duty and the potential suffering that could result from their harmful actions.\n\nIn a broader perspective, the verse encourages individuals to practice kindness and righteousness in their lives. It warns against cruel actions, suggesting that such deeds could lead to a downfall in one's moral stature and a life full of suffering. The verse encourages self-awareness, urging individuals to remember the potential consequences of their actions, and to live a life of virtue and compassion.\n\nThe cultural context of this verse lies in the prevalent belief in reincarnation and karma in Indian philosophies. The verse suggests that actions from past lives can influence one's present life, emphasizing the importance of moral behavior and kindness in shaping one's fate..The kural verse:அருளில்லார்க்கு அவ்வுலகம் இல்லை பொருளில்லார்க்குஇவ்வுலகம் இல்லாகி யாங்கு. ,translates to :This world is not for weathless ones  That world is not for graceless swines,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 247, from the Thiru Kural, emphasizes the importance of both material wealth and moral virtues, in particular, kindness. \n\nThe verse suggests a parallel between this world and the world beyond (which could refer to a spiritual realm, an afterlife, or a higher state of existence). It states that just as this world is not favorable for those without material wealth, the other world is not favorable for those without kindness. \n\nMaterial wealth is seen as necessary for comfortable and dignified survival in this physical world. It fulfills our basic needs, provides us with security, and ensures a certain quality of life. Similarly, the verse highlights kindness as a spiritual wealth, vital for our moral and spiritual well-being. \n\nWithout kindness, which is a fundamental virtue that involves compassion, empathy, and love towards others, one's spiritual life is considered barren. The absence of kindness could lead to moral poverty, which is as detrimental to the soul as material poverty is to the body.\n\nThus, the verse advocates for a balanced approach to life, emphasizing the need for both material prosperity and moral virtues. It encourages us to strive for wealth in this world while cultivating kindness to attain spiritual wealth in the world beyond..The kural verse:பொருளற்றார் பூப்பர் ஒருகால் அருளற்றார்அற்றார்மற் றாதல் அரிது. ,translates to :The wealthless may prosper one day;  The graceless never bloom agay,and it's explantion is :The verse 248 of Thiru Kural speaks about the significance of kindness and compassion in comparison to material wealth. It states that those who lack material wealth might have the opportunity to regain it in the future. Wealth is transient and can be accumulated over time with effort and fortune. However, those who lack kindness, compassion and love are truly destitute. \n\nThe absence of these virtues is a greater poverty than the lack of material wealth and it is far more difficult to regain once lost. It suggests that kindness and compassion are intrinsic values that are irreplaceable and cannot be bought or earned like material wealth. It underlines the moral that human virtues are more valuable than materialistic possessions. \n\nIn the broader cultural context, this verse emphasizes the importance of moral and ethical values in Tamil society. It encourages individuals to cultivate kindness and compassion, which are considered as the real wealth of a person. The verse upholds the Tamil ethical and moral viewpoint that values human virtues over material wealth..The kural verse:தெருளாதான் மெய்ப்பொருள் கண்டற்றால் தேரின்அருளாதான் செய்யும் அறம். ,translates to :Like Truth twisted by confused mind  Wisdom is vain in hearts unkind,and it's explantion is :This couplet or Kural from Thirukkural stresses on the importance of compassion (arul) in practicing any virtue (aram). The verse compares a person lacking in compassion but practicing virtue to a person who tries to understand the true essence of a text without having the required wisdom. Both their endeavors are in vain.\n\nThe verse tells us that without compassion, any virtuous act is meaningless. Just as wisdom is needed to understand the deeper truths of a text, compassion is necessary for any virtuous act to be truly meaningful. Without compassion, the act, however virtuous, is hollow and devoid of its true value.\n\nIn essence, Valluvar, the author, says that kindness or compassion is the foundation of all virtues. It is the spirit that gives life to every virtuous act. Without it, virtue is like a body without soul. Hence, one should cultivate compassion in order to truly appreciate and practice virtue..The kural verse:வலியார்முன் தன்னை நினைக்கதான் தன்னின்மெலியார்மேல் செல்லு மிடத்து. ,translates to :Think how you feel before the strong  When to the feeble you do wrong,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse is a powerful reminder of empathy and respect for all beings, irrespective of their strength or weakness. It encourages individuals to reflect on their own experiences of vulnerability before asserting power over those weaker than them. \n\nIn essence, this Kural suggests that when one contemplates causing harm to those weaker than themselves, they should recall the times they have found themselves trembling before those who are stronger. This reflection serves as a reminder of their own vulnerability and the fear associated with being at the mercy of someone else's power. \n\nThe verse is a plea for humility, empathy, and compassion. It asks us to remember that everyone has moments of weakness and strength, and using one's strength to harm or intimidate the weak is not a mark of true power or character. Instead, true strength lies in treating others with kindness and respect, regardless of their status or power. \n\nIn a broader sense, this Kural is a timeless reminder about the importance of treating others as we would like to be treated. It emphasizes the principle of 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you,' which is a universal moral law found across cultures and religions. \n\nThe Tamil explanations provided echo these sentiments, inviting individuals to consider their actions from a perspective of empathy and humility. They emphasize the importance of remembering one's own moments of fear and vulnerability when faced with those more powerful, as a deterrent against causing harm to those weaker..The kural verse:தன்னூன் பெருக்கற்குத் தான்பிறிது ஊனுண்பான்எங்ஙனம் ஆளும் அருள்? ,translates to :What graciousness can one command  who feeds his flesh by flesh gourmand,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse speaks of compassion and empathy towards all living beings, a cornerstone of Thiruvalluvar's philosophy. The couplet is a question posed to the reader, asking how can a person who eats the flesh of other creatures to nourish his own body be considered kind or compassionate?\n\nThe verse argues that the act of causing harm to another being for personal benefit is fundamentally incompatible with kindness. It is a critique of the practice of consuming meat, which necessitates the killing of animals. Thiruvalluvar uses this as a metaphor to communicate the broader moral principle of non-violence and empathy towards all sentient beings, which are central to ethical and virtuous living.\n\nThe question \"how can he be possessed of kindness?\" is rhetorical, implying that such a person cannot truly be kind or compassionate. This verse espouses the principle of 'Ahimsa' (non-violence), a key tenet of many Eastern philosophies and religions.\n\nIn essence, this Thiru Kural verse emphasizes the importance of empathy, kindness, and non-violence towards all living beings, and suggests that these virtues are incompatible with causing harm to others for one's own benefit..The kural verse:பொருளாட்சி போற்றாதார்க்கு இல்லை அருளாட்சிஆங்கில்லை ஊன்தின் பவர்க்கு. ,translates to :The thriftless have no property  And flesh-eaters have no pity,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural talks about the importance of care and compassion.\n\nIn the first half of the verse, Valluvar mentions that those who don't look after their possessions will not be considered as people who possess anything. This is a simple yet profound statement that reiterates the importance of responsibility and care towards one's belongings. Just having a possession isn't enough, one should know how to maintain and take care of it.\n\nIn the second half of the verse, Valluvar extends the same principle to compassion and kindness. He asserts that those who consume flesh are devoid of kindness. Here, Valluvar touches upon the concept of Ahimsa, which is the practice of non-violence and respect for all living beings. He implies that consuming meat is an act of violence towards animals and hence, those who partake in it cannot truly possess kindness.\n\nIn essence, the verse emphasizes the importance of responsibility and care, not only towards our possessions but also towards other living beings. It reminds us that ownership isn't just about possession, it also entails responsibility and compassion..The kural verse:படைகொண்டார் நெஞ்சம்போல் நன்னூக்காது ஒன்றன்உடல்சுவை உண்டார் மனம். ,translates to :Who wields a steel is steel-hearted  Who tastes body is hard-hearted,and it's explantion is :Kural 253 meditates on the morality of consuming the flesh of other sentient beings. The verse likens the mindset of a person who indulges in non-vegetarian food to that of someone holding a weapon with intent to harm. Both, according to the verse, have no regard for the virtue of compassion or humanity.\n\nThe verse is rooted in a deep sense of empathy for all living creatures, a cornerstone of many eastern philosophies. It suggests that indulging in the body of another creature for taste or pleasure is akin to violence, as it disregards the life and existence of that being. It questions not the act of eating itself, but the ethics and morality surrounding what we consume.\n\nThe verse implies that the act of eating meat is not merely a dietary choice but a moral one, affecting the purity and goodness of one's mind and heart. It urges the reader to consider the impact of their choices, not just on their own body, but also on their character and the world around them. \n\nIn essence, this verse promotes a lifestyle of non-violence and compassion towards all beings, a principle deeply ingrained in many cultures and philosophies..The kural verse:அருளல்ல தியாதெனிற் கொல்லாமை கோறல்பொருளல்லது அவ்வூன் தினல். ,translates to :If merciless it is to kill,  To kill and eat is disgraceful,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural speaks about kindness, its opposite, and the moral implications of taking a life for sustenance. \n\nIn essence, the Kural states that true kindness is the preservation of life, while its opposite is the destruction of life. Therefore, consuming flesh gained through the taking of a life is not considered virtuous or kind. This verse implies a strong stance towards non-violence and advocates for a vegetarian lifestyle.\n\nThe Kural urges us to consider the moral implications of our dietary choices, emphasizing the value of all life and the importance of kindness and compassion. It promotes a way of life that minimizes harm to other sentient beings, reflecting a fundamental principle in many spiritual and philosophical traditions.\n\nIn a broader perspective, the verse could also be interpreted as a call to avoid harm and destruction in our actions and decisions, promoting peace, preservation, and respect for all forms of life..The kural verse:உண்ணாமை உள்ளது உயிர்நிலை ஊனுண்ணஅண்ணாத்தல் செய்யாது அளறு. ,translates to :Off with flesh; a life you save  The eater hell's mouth shall not waive!,and it's explantion is :Kural 255 is a philosophical verse that highlights the importance of vegetarianism and compassion towards all living beings. The verse suggests that abstaining from consuming meat contributes to the sustainment and continuity of life. It is a call against taking the life of another creature for the sake of one's sustenance. \n\nIn essence, the verse is promoting the principle of 'Ahimsa' or non-violence, a core tenet found in many Eastern philosophies and religions. It suggests that by choosing not to eat meat, you are indirectly contributing to the preservation of life. \n\nOn the other hand, the verse warns of the consequences of eating meat. It suggests that if a person consumes meat, they will face severe repercussions in the afterlife. The verse metaphorically states that hell will not let the person escape, symbolizing the severity of the punishment.\n\nThe three Tamil explanations provided support this interpretation and emphasize different aspects of the verse. The first highlights the negative consequences of meat-eating, the second emphasizes the life-sustaining benefits of abstaining from meat, and the third frames it as a moral duty towards preserving life. \n\nOverall, this verse from Thirukkural teaches the value of compassion, non-violence, and respect towards all life forms. It suggests that our dietary choices can have profound spiritual and ethical implications..The kural verse:தினற்பொருட்டால் கொல்லாது உலகெனின் யாரும்விலைப்பொருட்டால் ஊன்றருவா ரில். ,translates to :None would kill and sell the flesh  For eating it if they don't wish,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 256, is a profound reflection on the interconnectedness of supply and demand in the context of meat consumption. The verse states that if people stop killing animals for the purpose of eating their flesh, then no one would engage in the business of selling meat for money. \n\nThe verse essentially highlights the power of consumer demand in driving market practices. In this case, the market practice is the slaughtering of animals for their meat. If people cease to consume meat and thus reduce the demand, the supply would naturally diminish and eventually cease, leading to a world where no one engages in meat trade for money.\n\nThis verse also carries a subtle but powerful message about ethical consumption and the responsibility of consumers in shaping market practices. It encourages individuals to reflect on their dietary choices and the impact they have on the world around them. \n\nUltimately, the verse is a plea for compassion towards all living beings and an indictment of the unnecessary violence involved in meat consumption. It suggests that a world free from the killing of animals for food would also be a world free from the trade of meat for profit..The kural verse:உண்ணாமை வேண்டும் புலாஅல் பிறிதொன்றன்புண்ணது உணர்வார்ப் பெறின். ,translates to :From eating flesh men must abstain  If they but feel the being's pain,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural advocates for abstaining from eating meat. The poet, Thiruvalluvar, presents a perspective that flesh (meat) is essentially an unclean part of another living being's body, equating it to an ulcer or a sore. \n\nThe term 'pulaaal' used here is a metaphorical reference to flesh as a disease or an ulcer. The underlying principle that Thiruvalluvar is trying to convey is the concept of 'Ahimsa' or non-violence, which is a fundamental tenet in many Indian philosophies and religions. It propagates the idea that one should not cause harm or pain to another living being, and in this context, it implies abstaining from eating meat.\n\nThiruvalluvar suggests that if people truly understood the nature of what they are consuming, they would abstain from it. This verse encourages introspection and consciousness about our food habits, urging us to make ethical and compassionate choices. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can be interpreted as a call for empathy towards all living beings and a plea for a more harmonious co-existence. It's not just about dietary choices, but also about cultivating a mindset of respect and consideration for all forms of life..The kural verse:செயிரின் தலைப்பிரிந்த காட்சியார் உண்ணார்உயிரின் தலைப்பிரிந்த ஊன். ,translates to :Whose mind from illusion is freed  Refuse on lifeless flesh to feed,and it's explantion is :Kural 258 discusses the concept of vegetarianism from a philosophical and ethical standpoint. This verse asserts that those who have achieved a state of clarity and wisdom, having rid themselves of mental illusions or delusions, will refrain from consuming meat, which is only obtained by severing it from a living being.\n\nIn the Tamil cultural and philosophical context, this Kural may be interpreted as an advocacy for ahimsa or non-violence, a principle deeply embedded in many Indian philosophies, which includes not causing harm to other living beings for one's sustenance.\n\nThe underlying moral principle here is respect for all forms of life and the understanding that each life form has an inherent right to live, which should not be violated for the sake of satiating one's palate. This verse thus promotes compassion, empathy, and non-violence while discouraging the act of inflicting harm or death upon other creatures for food. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse encourages us to introspect on our actions, consider their consequences, and make choices that reflect empathy and respect for all life forms. It suggests that true wisdom lies in understanding the interconnectedness of all beings and in making choices that uphold this principle of coexistence..The kural verse:அவிசொரிந் தாயிரம் வேட்டலின் ஒன்றன்உயிர்செகுத் துண்ணாமை நன்று. ,translates to :Not to-kill-and-eat, truly  Excels thousand pourings of ghee!,and it's explantion is :Kural 259 emphasizes the principle of non-violence, vegetarianism, and compassion for all living beings. The verse juxtaposes the act of performing a thousand religious sacrifices, involving the burning of ghee and other substances, with the act of refraining from killing an animal for food. The Kural asserts that the act of not killing and consuming an animal is superior to performing a thousand sacrificial rituals.\n\nThe underlying moral message here is that true virtue is not in performing rituals and sacrifices, but in showing kindness and compassion towards all living beings. The act of abstaining from meat suggests a practice of non-violence, which is deemed to be a higher form of virtue than any ritualistic offerings. It speaks to the essence of humanity, which is to cause no harm, especially when there are alternatives available for sustenance.\n\nThis Kural could be interpreted as a call for vegetarianism, but it is also a broader call for practicing non-violence and empathy in all aspects of life, not just in our dietary choices. The verse encourages individuals to value life and respect all forms of it, a sentiment that resonates with the core ethical principles of many philosophical and religious systems..The kural verse:கொல்லான் புலாலை மறுத்தானைக் கைகூப்பிஎல்லா உயிருந் தொழும். ,translates to :All lives shall lift their palms to him  Who eats not flesh nor kills with whim,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the principle of Ahimsa, non-violence, and vegetarianism. The poet Valluvar suggests that all creatures will respect and admire the person who has never taken a life or consumed flesh. This verse promotes an ethos of compassion towards all living beings and encourages a lifestyle that avoids causing harm or suffering to others.\n\nLiving a life without causing harm to other creatures is seen as a virtuous path. Such a person who refrains from killing and eating meat is considered worthy of respect and admiration by all beings, according to Valluvar. In a broader sense, this verse underscores the interconnectedness of all life forms and promotes peace and harmony in the world.\n\nThe phrase \"All creatures will join their hands together, and worship him\" is metaphorical, suggesting that such a person is universally respected and venerated. The verse is not just about an individual's dietary choices but serves as an ethical guideline for leading a life of non-violence and respect for all life forms..The kural verse:உற்றநோய் நோன்றல் உயிர்க்குறுகண் செய்யாமைஅற்றே தவத்திற் குரு. ,translates to :Pains endure; pain not beings  This is the type of true penance,and it's explantion is :Kural 261 provides a distinct definition of the nature of religious discipline or asceticism. It posits that the two fundamental pillars of asceticism are: enduring personal hardships and refraining from inflicting any harm or pain on others. \n\nThe first part highlights the ability to endure personal afflictions and hardships with patience and fortitude. This is often an integral part of spiritual and religious discipline. The idea is to learn acceptance, perseverance, and to cultivate a spirit of detachment from physical discomforts.\n\nThe second part emphasizes on the ethic of non-harming or 'Ahimsa'. It means one must not cause pain, harm, or discomfort to any living being, either through action, speech, or thought. This fosters compassion, empathy, and respect for all life forms, which are crucial virtues in most spiritual paths.\n\nIn essence, the verse suggests that true religious discipline or asceticism is not just about personal spiritual practices, but also about how one's actions affect others. It encourages a balance between personal endurance and social responsibility, thus ensuring that spiritual growth does not come at the expense of causing harm to others..The kural verse:தவமும் தவமுடையார்க்கு ஆகும் அதனைஅஃதிலார் மேற்கொள் வது. ,translates to :Penance is fit for penitents  Not for him who in vain pretends,and it's explantion is :The Kural 262 emphasizes the significance of discipline, devotion, and perseverance in one's spiritual journey. It suggests that the practice of austerities, which includes self-discipline and self-denial, is meaningful only to those who have already embraced them in their previous lives. This verse speaks to the law of karma in Hindu philosophy, which believes our past actions influence our present circumstances.\n\nIn essence, the verse implies that spiritual practices such as austerities cannot be effectively adopted or borne spontaneously, without a solid foundation or predisposition towards them. They require a certain level of spiritual maturity and readiness, which often stems from previous spiritual endeavors. Those who try to practice austerities without this preparation may find it futile and unfulfilling.\n\nThis is not to discourage those new to the spiritual path but to stress the importance of sincerity, continuity, and commitment in spiritual practices. It serves as a reminder that the benefits of these practices are not immediate gratification but the product of consistent efforts over time, and potentially, lifetimes..The kural verse:துறந்தார்க்குத் துப்புரவு வேண்டி மறந்தார்கொல்மற்றை யவர்கள் தவம். ,translates to :Is it to true penitent's aid,  That others austere path avoid?,and it's explantion is :Kural 263 is a reflection on the relationship between ascetics and the general public. The verse suggests that the primary duty of those who have not chosen the ascetic life is to support those who have. This support typically comes in the form of providing food and other necessities to the ascetics, as they have renounced all earthly possessions and desires. \n\nThe verse implies a critique of those who neglect this duty. It suggests that they have forgotten the importance of austerity, a key aspect of spirituality. Austerity here refers to self-discipline and self-control, which are cornerstones of spiritual growth. \n\nIn other words, the verse criticizes those who, while not being ascetics themselves, fail to uphold their part of the societal contract by neglecting to support those who have chosen the spiritual path. They are seen as failing in their spiritual duty, which is different from that of the ascetics, but no less important. \n\nThe verse thus encourages a balance between the spiritual and material aspects of life, with each sector of society supporting the other in their respective roles. It suggests that spirituality is not solely the domain of the ascetics, but is a responsibility shared by all, each in their own way..The kural verse:ஒன்னார்த் தெறலும் உவந்தாரை ஆக்கலும்எண்ணின் தவத்தான் வரும். ,translates to :In penance lies the power to save  The friends and foil the foe and knave,and it's explantion is :The verse 264 of Thiru Kural emphasizes the power of austerity, discipline, and mental determination. According to this Kural, if a spiritually disciplined person wills the downfall of his adversaries or the prosperity of his friends, such outcomes can be achieved through the potency of his austerity and relentless concentration. \n\nThis verse underscores the immense power of focused spiritual energy and moral virtues. It suggests that when an individual's life is characterized by austerity, self-restraint, and mental vigor, they can channel their energy to bring about desired changes. This could be either to neutralize their enemies or to uplift their friends. \n\nHowever, this verse should not be misinterpreted as promoting harm to anyone. The term 'enemies' here represents negative forces or obstacles in one's life, while 'friends' symbolize positive energies or aspects that one wishes to enhance. The overall message of the Kural is about the manifestation of the strength of the human will when guided by moral and spiritual discipline. \n\nThe power of such disciplined will and austerity should be used judiciously and ethically for the betterment of oneself and others, reflecting Thiruvalluvar's wisdom about righteous conduct and the power of the mind..The kural verse:வேண்டிய வேண்டியாங் கெய்தலால் செய்தவம்ஈண்டு முயலப் படும். ,translates to :What they wish as they wish is won  Here hence by men penance is done,and it's explantion is :Kural 265 revolves around the practice of religious discipline for the attainment of desired outcomes in the afterlife. This verse suggests that people engage in religious rituals, practices, and disciplines in their present life with the hope of securing what they wish to have in the next life.\n\nThe verse implies that the primary motivation behind religious activities is the belief in the rewards it brings in the afterlife. People believe that through their adherence to religious principles, rituals, and disciplines, they can shape their future life according to their desires. It could be peace, happiness, prosperity, or a particular state of existence. \n\nThe kural emphasizes the role of faith in driving religious activities. It also suggests that the pursuit of spiritual practices is not purely altruistic but is driven by the desire for personal gain in the afterlife. The verse encourages striving and making efforts in the present life, adhering to religious disciplines, for the potential rewards in the future life.\n\nIn essence, this verse underscores the belief in karma, the law of cause and effect, which is a central philosophy in many religions. What one does in the present life affects the outcomes in the next life. Therefore, practicing religious discipline is seen as a means of ensuring desired outcomes in the afterlife..The kural verse:தவஞ்செய்வார் தங்கருமஞ் செய்வார்மற் றல்லார்அவஞ்செய்வார் ஆசையுட் பட்டு. ,translates to :Who do penance achieve their aim  Others desire-rid themselves harm,and it's explantion is :Kural 266 emphasizes the importance of performing one's duty with discipline and self-restraint, which is referred to as \"austerities\" in the verse. It highlights the destructive consequences of indulging in desires driven by the pursuit of material wealth and sensual pleasure. \n\nThe verse suggests that those who practice such self-discipline, demonstrating qualities such as constraint, love, and the ability to endure hardships, are truly fulfilling their responsibilities. This discipline is akin to 'Thavam' or asceticism, a spiritual practice aimed at self-purification and attainment of higher knowledge. \n\nOn the contrary, those who let their desires guide them and get entangled in the pursuit of worldly pleasures end up wasting their efforts in futile actions, thus paving the way for their own downfall. The verse is a gentle reminder of the transient nature of materialistic pleasures and encourages individuals to focus on their duties and responsibilities, upholding moral and ethical standards. \n\nTherefore, this verse advocates for the practice of self-restraint and discipline as means to fulfilling one's duties, and warns against the perils of succumbing to worldly desires. It promotes a life of simplicity, integrity, and spiritual growth over materialistic indulgence..The kural verse:சுடச்சுடரும் பொன்போல் ஒளிவிடும் துன்பஞ்சுடச்சுட நோற்கிற் பவர்க்கு. ,translates to :Pure and bright gets the gold in fire;  and so the life by pain austere,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse, 267, draws an analogy between the process of refining gold and the personal growth that comes from enduring hardship and pain. Just as gold becomes more radiant and pure when it is heated and purified in fire, human beings shine brighter and become more virtuous when they endure and overcome their sufferings and challenges. \n\nIn the context of spirituality, this verse emphasizes the importance of austerities, self-discipline, and self-denial. These practices often involve enduring some form of discomfort or pain, whether physical, mental, or emotional. But just as gold is not diminished but rather purified by fire, those who undertake these practices are not weakened but strengthened by their experiences. Their character is refined and their wisdom deepens, much like the purity of gold increases with each refining.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse also speaks to the universal human experience of facing and overcoming challenges. It suggests that enduring hardship and pain can lead to personal growth and transformation. By facing our struggles with courage and resilience, we can emerge stronger and wiser, just like gold shining brighter after being refined in the fire.\n\nIn essence, this verse reminds us that hardships and trials are not necessarily detrimental. Instead, they can serve as catalysts for our personal and spiritual growth, making us shine brighter in the end..The kural verse:தன்னுயிர் தான்அறப் பெற்றானை ஏனையமன்னுயி ரெல்லாந் தொழும். ,translates to :He worship wins from every soul  Who Master is by soul control,and it's explantion is :Kural 268 speaks about self-realization and self-control, which are considered as the highest forms of wisdom and strength according to Thirukkural. The verse beautifully illustrates that all beings will revere the person who has achieved mastery over his own soul.\n\nThe verse starts with \"தன்னுயிர் தான் அறப் பெற்றானை\", which translates to \"he who has attained control of his own soul\". This refers to a person who has achieved self-realization, understanding, and control over his own desires, emotions, and thoughts. Such a person is not swayed by external circumstances or influenced by their own internal turmoil.\n\nThe next part \"ஏனைய மன்னுயி ரெல்லாந் தொழும்\", translates to \"all other creatures will worship him\". This signifies that such a person who has gained control over his own soul commands respect and reverence from all other beings. This could be due to the peace, wisdom, and strength that emanate from such a person, attracting others towards them.\n\nIn essence, this verse highlights the importance of self-control and self-realization. It encourages individuals to work towards mastering their own mind and emotions, as this is the path to gaining respect and reverence from others. It also subtly points out that our strength lies in our ability to control ourselves, rather than attempting to control others or external circumstances..The kural verse:கூற்றம் குதித்தலும் கைகூடும் நோற்றலின்ஆற்றல் தலைப்பட் டவர்க்குல். ,translates to :They can even defy death  Who get by penance godly strenth,and it's explantion is :Kural 269 is a profound verse that emphasizes the power of religious discipline and steadfast faith, even in the face of adversity. \n\nThe verse suggests that those who have nurtured their spiritual strength through religious discipline possess an extraordinary power. This power is not just physical or mental - it is a spiritual force that enables them to withstand and transcend all forms of suffering and hardship. \n\nThe reference to 'Yama', the God of death in Hindu mythology, is significant. This verse implies that those who have the power of religious discipline can even overcome the inevitability of death. It is not to be taken literally, but rather, it symbolizes the ability to rise above the fear of death and the transient nature of life. \n\nIn essence, this verse is a testament to the resilience, strength, and transcendental power that one can attain through religious discipline and spiritual practice. It is a reminder of the potential of human spirit and the power of faith to surmount even the most formidable challenges. \n\nThe moral interpretation here is that true power and resilience come from spiritual strength and adherence to one's faith and principles, rather than from physical might or worldly possessions. It encourages individuals to pursue spiritual growth and discipline as a means of attaining true strength and overcoming life's adversities..The kural verse:இலர்பல ராகிய காரணம் நோற்பார்சிலர்பலர் நோலா தவர். ,translates to :Many are poor and few are rich  For they care not for penance much,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural speaks about the importance of self-discipline and austerity in one's life. It states that the reason why there are many impoverished people and few wealthy people in the world is because there are many who do not practice self-discipline and few who do.\n\nThe verse underscores the virtue of austerity, which here refers to self-control, discipline, and the ability to withstand hardship. It suggests that those who practice austerity, or self-discipline, are often the ones who attain wealth and prosperity, while those lacking in these qualities often find themselves in want.\n\nThis is not just a statement about economic status, but also about the richness of one's life in terms of wisdom, contentment, and inner peace. The verse implies that the path to true wealth is not through the accumulation of material possessions, but through the cultivation of self-discipline and inner strength.\n\nThe verse also highlights a social paradox that while the practice of austerity is beneficial, it is not widely practiced. This is a reflection on human nature's tendency towards taking the path of least resistance, often choosing immediate gratification over long-term benefit.\n\nIn essence, this verse is a call to cultivate and practice self-discipline, as it leads to true wealth and prosperity in life, both materially and spiritually..The kural verse:வஞ்ச மனத்தான் படிற்றொழுக்கம் பூதங்கள்ஐந்தும் அகத்தே நகும். ,translates to :Elements five of feigned life  Of a sly hypocrite within laugh,and it's explantion is :Kural 271 delves into the inherent nature of deceit and the consequences it holds for the person who indulges in it. The verse uses the metaphor of the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, and ether/space) that constitute the human body to convey its profound message.\n\nThis verse suggests that when a person with a deceitful mind pretends to act virtuously, his very own body mocks at his hypocrisy. The five elements, which are believed to form the human body, laugh within him, illustrating the fact that deceit cannot be hidden and is evident to the core of one's being.\n\nThe verse underscores the moral principle that dishonesty is not only visible to the outside world, but it is also recognized and ridiculed by the very elements that form the dishonest person. The essence of this teaching is that true virtue comes from sincerity and authenticity, not from false pretenses or deceitful conduct. The verse encourages individuals to act with integrity and honesty, as false conduct is not only recognized by others but also by our own selves, at a fundamental level. \n\nThis verse also emphasizes the importance of the alignment between our thoughts, words, and actions. When these are not in harmony, the dissonance causes internal conflict, represented here by the laughter of the five elements..The kural verse:வானுயர் தோற்றம் எவன்செய்யும் தன்னெஞ்சம்தான்அறி குற்றப் படின். ,translates to :Of what avail are sky-high shows  When guild the conscience gnaws and knows,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 272, underscores the importance of inner purity over external appearances. It argues that no matter how high and sanctified one's outward appearance may seem, akin to the heavenly skies, it is rendered meaningless if the individual knowingly indulges in sinful thoughts or actions. \n\nThe verse emphasizes the idea that true piety and morality are not about external displays of sanctity, but about the purity and righteousness of the mind and heart. It warns against hypocrisy, where people put on a facade of being virtuous while harboring sinful thoughts and intentions internally. \n\nIn essence, the verse serves as a reminder that appearances can be deceptive, and true virtue lies within one's heart and actions. It encourages introspection, self-awareness, and authenticity in one's spiritual journey..The kural verse:வலியில் நிலைமையான் வல்லுருவம் பெற்றம்புலியின்தோல் போர்த்துமேய்ந் தற்று. ,translates to :Vaunting sainthood while week within  Seems a grazer with tiger skin,and it's explantion is :The Kural 273 speaks about the pretense of power and control that is not authentic. It compares a person who lacks self-restraint and the ability to perform austerity but pretends otherwise, to a cow draped in a tiger's skin. \n\nThe cow, by wearing a tiger's skin, may give a false impression of power and danger. However, when it starts grazing, its true nature is revealed. Similarly, a person may assume an appearance of power, but without the ability to control their senses and live a disciplined life, their pretense will eventually come to light.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of authentic power and self-control, as opposed to mere outward appearances. It suggests that true power lies in self-restraint and discipline, not in mere appearances or pretenses. \n\nIn a broader interpretation, this verse can also be viewed as a critique of hypocrisy and deceit. It underscores that pretending to be what one is not, is not only deceptive but also unsustainable in the long run. The verse calls for authenticity and integrity in one's actions and character..The kural verse:தவமறைந்து அல்லவை செய்தல் புதல்மறைந்துவேட்டுவன் புள்சிமிழ்த் தற்று. ,translates to :Sinning in saintly show is like  Fowlers in ambush birds to strike,and it's explantion is :The Kural 274 underscores the moral depravity of using a religious guise for committing sinful actions. The verse compares a person who pretends to be an ascetic but engages in wrongful deeds, to a hunter who hides in the bushes to trap unsuspecting birds.\n\nThe comparison highlights the exploitation of trust and betrayal involved in both situations. The birds, unaware of the hidden danger, fall prey to the hunter. Similarly, people, trusting the ascetic due to his assumed spiritual stature, can be easily deceived and harmed. \n\nThis verse is a powerful reminder of the responsibility that comes with religious or spiritual authority. It condemns those who misuse such positions for personal gain or to harm others, emphasizing that the facade of spirituality cannot camouflage one's misdeeds. It's a critique on hypocrisy and the misuse of power, warning us to be vigilant about such deceit. \n\nThiruvalluvar, through this verse, promotes authenticity, accountability, and the ethical use of power, be it spiritual, religious, or otherwise..The kural verse:பற்றற்றேம் என்பார் படிற்றொழுக்கம் எற்றெற்றென்றுஏதம் பலவுந் தரும். ,translates to :Who false within but freedom feign  Shall moan \\\"What have we done\\\" with pain,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse speaks about the consequences of false conduct and insincerity in one's spiritual pursuits. \n\nThe verse warns that those who falsely claim to have renounced all material desires, while still harboring them and acting against their professed renunciation, will eventually face deep remorse and sorrow. They will find themselves lamenting, \"Oh! what have we done, what have we done,\" as they face the repercussions of their deceit.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of sincerity and consistency in one's actions and words. It suggests that pretense, especially in spiritual and moral matters, will inevitably lead to regret and sorrow. This teaching is universal and can be applied in all aspects of life, not just spiritual pursuits. \n\nThe verse also indirectly highlights the value of truthfulness, integrity, and the need for inner transformation when one decides to renounce worldly attachments. Mere outward show of renunciation, without an inner change, will only lead to self-deception and eventual suffering. The verse thus encourages genuine introspection and sincere actions in one's journey towards spiritual growth..The kural verse:நெஞ்சின் துறவார் துறந்தார்போல் வஞ்சித்துவாழ்வாரின் வன்கணார் இல். ,translates to :Vilest is he who seems a saint  Cheating the world without restraint,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the deception of individuals who pretend to have renounced the world and its desires when they have not done so truly in their hearts. In essence, the verse criticizes the hypocrisy of such individuals. \n\nThe verse suggests that there are no people more heartless than those who live a life of falsehood, pretending to have renounced all desires but still harboring them in their hearts. These individuals present a false image of themselves to the world as ascetics or renunciates, while secretly engaging in the very desires they claim to have given up. They deceive others through their dishonesty and insincerity. \n\nIn terms of cultural context, the practice of renunciation is highly respected in Indian philosophy which advocates detachment from worldly desires as a path to enlightenment. However, this verse condemns those who exploit this respect by pretending to be renunciates for personal gain or deceitful purposes. \n\nThe moral interpretation of the verse is clear: honesty and sincerity are more important than outward appearances. It's better to be honest about one's desires than to falsely claim to have renounced them. Ultimately, true renunciation is a matter of the heart and cannot be faked..The kural verse:புறங்குன்றி கண்டனைய ரேனும் அகங்குன்றிமுக்கிற் கரியார் உடைத்து. ,translates to :Berry-red is his outward view,  Black like its nose his inward hue,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural talks about the deceptive nature of some individuals who appear to be good on the outside but harbor ill intentions within. The poet compares such individuals to the Abrus seed, known as 'Kundrimani' in Tamil. This seed is known for its bright red outer shell and a black dot at one end.\n\nThe bright red color of the seed is enticing and appears harmless, much like the outward demeanor of some people who may seem kind, generous, and virtuous. However, just as the black dot on the seed signifies something darker within, these individuals may have inner intentions that are not as pure as their outward appearance suggests. They may harbor negative feelings such as envy, bitterness, or deceit, which they hide behind their pleasant exterior.\n\nThe lesson from this verse is to not judge individuals solely based on their outward appearance or behavior. It emphasizes the importance of understanding a person's true character, which is reflected in their thoughts and intentions, not just their actions..The kural verse:மனத்தது மாசாக மாண்டார் நீராடிமறைந்தொழுகு மாந்தர் பலர். ,translates to :Filthy in mind some bathe in streams  Hiding sins in showy extremes,and it's explantion is :Kural 278 delves into the idea of deceptive appearances and the discrepancy between outward behavior and inner intentions. The verse metaphorically talks about individuals who, much like those who cleanse themselves in water to appear clean, mask their inner impurities with superficial outward conduct, thereby deceiving those around them.\n\nThese individuals, as the verse underlines, are not few but many. They perform ritualistic ablutions or adopt virtuous behaviors only as a facade. The moral turpitude or the flaws in their character remain hidden beneath their 'masked conduct'.\n\nThe verse cautions us about such deceptive people who might seem virtuous externally but harbor vices internally. It also encourages introspection, urging us to be genuine in our actions, aligning our outward behaviors with our inner values and principles. \n\nIn essence, the verse affirms that true virtue is not merely about external appearances or rituals but is about the purity of the heart and mind. It also serves as a reminder that one should not be quickly taken in by the external appearances of people..The kural verse:கணைகொடிது யாழ்கோடு செவ்விதுஆங் கன்னவினைபடு பாலால் கொளல். ,translates to :Know men by acts and not by forms  Strait arrow kills, bent lute but charms,and it's explantion is :Kural 279 talks about the discernment of the nature of people not through their appearance, but through their actions. The verse uses the analogy of an arrow and a lute to deliver its message. Despite its straight appearance, an arrow can cause harm, while a lute, which appears curved and crooked, can produce pleasing music. \n\nThe verse suggests that in the same way, the true nature of individuals should be judged through their actions, rather than their physical appearance or outward demeanor. Someone might appear pleasant and straight-forward, akin to the arrow, but their actions could cause pain and harm. Conversely, someone might not have a conventional appeal, like the curved lute, but their actions could bring joy and positivity.\n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes the importance of actions over appearance in assessing a person's character and moral integrity, a principle that remains relevant in our modern society. It advises not to be deceived by external appearances, and promotes wisdom in discerning the inherent nature of individuals through their deeds..The kural verse:மழித்தலும் நீட்டலும் வேண்டா உலகம்பழித்தது ஒழித்து விடின். ,translates to :No balding nor tangling the hair!  Abstain from condemned acts with care,and it's explantion is :Kural 280 emphasizes the importance of one's actions over their external appearances or rituals. The verse asserts that there is no necessity for shaving one's head or growing matted hair (practices often associated with religious or spiritual devotion) if a person can abstain from actions that are generally condemned or considered harmful by wise and enlightened people.\n\nThe verse suggests that real spirituality or righteousness is not about external symbols or rituals, but about one's conduct and actions. It encourages individuals to focus on refraining from harmful or morally wrong actions, rather than on the superficial aspects of religious practices. The verse promotes the idea that true wisdom and virtue lie in one's actions and not in their external appearance or rituals.\n\nIn simpler terms, this verse is a call to focus on inner transformation and good deeds, rather than outward symbols of piety. It says that if one can avoid deeds that are generally condemned by the world, then there is no need for them to showcase their spirituality or devotion through outward signs such as shaving their heads or growing tangled hair..The kural verse:எள்ளாமை வேண்டுவான் என்பான் எனைத்தொன்றும்கள்ளாமை காக்கதன் நெஞ்சு. ,translates to :Let him who would reproachless be  From all frauds guard his conscience free,and it's explantion is :The Thiru Kural verse 281 emphasizes the virtue of honesty and integrity. It advises that if one wishes to live a life free from contempt and degradation, they should refrain from the thought of cheating others, even for the smallest gain. This includes not only the physical act of stealing but also harboring such an intention in mind.\n\nThe verse underlines the importance of moral and ethical behavior in earning respect and admiration from others. It suggests that even the smallest act of dishonesty can tarnish one's reputation and lead to social disgrace.\n\nThe cultural context of this verse lies in the ancient Tamil society's emphasis on righteousness (aṟam) and good conduct (anbudaiyāṟam). It encourages individuals to safeguard their minds from the intention of deceit, as such intentions could lead to harmful actions affecting both the individual and society at large.\n\nIn essence, this Thiru Kural verse encourages us to uphold honesty and integrity, as these virtues form the basis of a respectable and dignified life. The moral interpretation here is clear: to live a life free from scorn, one must guard their heart from the thought of defrauding others, no matter how insignificant the gain might seem..The kural verse:உள்ளத்தால் உள்ளலும் தீதே பிறன்பொருளைக்கள்ளத்தால் கள்வேம் எனல். ,translates to :\\\"We will by fraud win other's wealth\\\"  Even this thought is sin and stealth,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of the purity of thoughts. It asserts that even considering committing a sin is equivalent to committing the sin itself. Specifically, it warns against the thought of deceitfully taking someone else's property. \n\nIt suggests that even the contemplation of stealing, or acquiring someone else's belongings through dishonest means, is as wrong as the act itself. This verse underscores the moral principle that our thoughts shape our actions, and therefore, it is crucial to maintain integrity not just in our actions but also in our thoughts. \n\nThe verse promotes the virtues of honesty, respect for others' property, and the importance of self-control over one's desires. It encourages individuals to refrain from nurturing harmful thoughts, as they could potentially lead to harmful actions.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this verse highlights the profound understanding of human psychology in ancient Tamil philosophy. It acknowledges the power of thoughts in shaping behavior and emphasizes the need for mental discipline and ethical thinking..The kural verse:களவினால் ஆகிய ஆக்கம் அளவிறந்துஆவது போலக் கெடும். ,translates to :The gain by fraud may overflow  But swift to ruin it shall go,and it's explantion is :Kural 283 is a profound verse that delineates the precariousness and transient nature of wealth that is amassed through deceitful means. The verse vividly portrays that any prosperity obtained through fraudulent actions, though it might appear to multiply at first, is destined to dwindle and eventually vanish.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the moral principle that ill-gotten wealth will not last, even if it initially seems to flourish. This is due to the violation of the inherent order and justice in the universe. The act of fraud disrupts the balance, and as a consequence, the universe conspires to restore it, leading to the eventual downfall of the fraudulent.\n\nMoreover, this verse also subtly underlines the concept of Karma – the law of cause and effect. Any actions taken against the moral order, such as acquiring wealth through deceit, will have its repercussions. The person might initially enjoy the benefits of the ill-gotten wealth, but in the long run, they will have to face the consequences of their actions, leading to the loss of not just the acquired wealth, but potentially their existing assets as well.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, through this Kural, advocates honesty and righteousness in one's actions, especially in the pursuit of wealth. He warns against the temporary and illusory nature of wealth amassed through deceit, and the inevitable ruin it brings, thus promoting ethical and honest means for wealth acquisition..The kural verse:களவின்கண் கன்றிய காதல் விளைவின்கண்வீயா விழுமம் தரும். ,translates to :The fruit that fraud and greed obtain  Shall end in endless grief and pain,and it's explantion is :Kural 284 delves into the consequences of the act of deceit or fraud. It essentially implies that an intense desire to defraud others, to gain at their expense, will eventually lead to unending sorrow when the actions finally bear their fruits. \n\nThis verse beautifully portrays the universal law of karma, which states that every action has an equivalent reaction. If one sows the seeds of deceit and dishonesty, they are bound to reap the fruits of sorrow and regret. The sorrow that comes as a result of deceit is described as \"undying,\" emphasizing the long-term and severe consequences of such actions.\n\nThe verse encourages moral and ethical behavior. It warns against the temporary allure of fraudulent gains, highlighting the profound and lasting sorrow that these actions can bring. It is a timeless reminder that honesty and integrity in our dealings with others are not just virtuous, but also in our own best interest..The kural verse:அருள்கருதி அன்புடைய ராதல் பொருள்கருதிப்பொச்சாப்புப் பார்ப்பார்கண் இல். ,translates to :Love and Grace are not their worth  Who watch to waylay dozer's wealth,and it's explantion is :Kural 285 discusses the qualities of kindness and benevolence and how they are incompatible with the act of coveting someone else's wealth or property. \n\nIn the verse, Thiruvalluvar states that individuals who harbor and act on an intention to exploit another person's vulnerability and seize their possessions do not possess the true qualities of compassion and love. These individuals are always on the lookout for a moment of negligence or forgetfulness from others to take advantage of the situation for their own gain.\n\nThe essence of this Kural is that genuine kindness and love involve selflessness and a deep regard for the well-being of others. If one is truly kind and benevolent, they would not entertain thoughts of taking advantage of others, let alone act on these thoughts. \n\nTherefore, the verse teaches us the importance of sincerity in our kindness and love towards others. It emphasizes that true benevolence is incompatible with selfish desires and intentions. It also highlights the moral responsibility to respect others' rights and property, a principle that forms the basis of a just and harmonious society..The kural verse:அளவின்கண் நின்றொழுகல் ஆற்றார் களவின்கண்கன்றிய காத லவர். ,translates to :They cannot walk in measured bounds  who crave and have covetous ends,and it's explantion is :Kural 286 reflects upon the morality and righteousness in one's conduct, particularly in relation to the act of deceit or fraud. The verse suggests that those who harbor an intense desire to defraud others, to deceive or take what does not rightfully belong to them, are unable to lead a life of integrity and adherence to moral principles or rules.\n\nThe essence of this verse lies in the notion of 'Alavu' or limit. It implies that a life lived within set boundaries, respecting the rights and possessions of others, is a life of rectitude. However, those who are inclined towards deception ('Kalavu' or theft) are seen as individuals who have stepped beyond these moral boundaries. They are unable to sustain a life of honor and virtue, as their actions are driven by greed and selfishness rather than respect and fairness.\n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse underlines a fundamental aspect of ethical conduct, where one's actions should not infringe upon the rights of others. Those who engage in deceitful acts not only disrupt their own moral compass but also undermine the social harmony. Therefore, it advocates for a life of honesty, fairness, and respect for others' rights, as that is the path of righteousness and personal integrity..The kural verse:களவென்னும் காரறி வாண்மை அளவென்னும்ஆற்றல் புரிந்தார்கண்ட இல். ,translates to :Men of measured wisdom shun  Black art of fraud and what it won,and it's explantion is :The Kural 287 emphasizes on the virtue of honesty and integrity. It asserts that those who understand and practice rectitude or moral righteousness will not resort to fraudulent practices or deceit. Such individuals hold an inner strength and moral courage that keeps them above dishonesty.\n\nThis verse highlights the distinction between 'black-knowledge', which refers to deceit or dishonesty, and 'greatness', which is equated to rectitude or moral integrity. It suggests that those who aspire for true greatness in the form of moral integrity would not indulge in deceitful actions.\n\nSimply put, those who truly understand the value and importance of honesty and integrity, and those who aspire to live a life filled with these virtues, will not resort to fraud or dishonesty. This verse underlines the fact that a morally upright life cannot coexist with deceitful practices. It reflects the time-honored values of honesty, integrity, and rectitude that are central to the teachings of Thiru Kural..The kural verse:அளவறிந்தார் நெஞ்சத் தறம்போல நிற்கும்களவறிந்தார் நெஞ்சில் கரவு. ,translates to :Virtue abides in righteous hearts  Into minds of frauds deceit darts,and it's explantion is :This couplet, Kural 288, from Thiru Kural emphasizes on the nature of one's mind being shaped by their actions and intentions. The verse beautifully illustrates that deceit is as inherent in the minds of those who practice fraudulence, just as virtue tends to reside in the minds of those who adhere to honesty and righteousness.\n\nJust as an individual who understands and practices fairness and morality naturally embodies virtue in their thoughts and actions, a person who is accustomed to deceit and duplicity will naturally harbor dishonesty in their mind. \n\nThis verse encourages us to be conscious of our actions and habits, as they shape not only our character but also our thoughts and intentions. In other words, it sends a strong message to society that our thoughts and actions are intertwined, and one's character is invariably reflected in one's actions.\n\nThe verse also implies a moral warning that deceptive behavior not only harms others but also corrupts the deceiver's mind, leading them further away from virtue and truth. It advocates for a life of honesty, transparency, and fairness in all our dealings. \n\nIn a broader sense, the verse serves as a reminder of the timeless principle of karma - we reap what we sow, and our actions, good or bad, shape our character and destiny. The verse, thus, promotes the values of integrity, fairness, and righteousness, while warning against deceit and fraudulence..The kural verse:அளவல்ல செய்தாங்கே வீவர் களவல்லமற்றைய தேற்றா தவர். ,translates to :They perish in their perfidy  Who know nothing but pilfery,and it's explantion is :Kural 289 emphasizes the destructive consequences of fraudulent actions. The verse suggests that those who engage in deceitful practices, and who know no other way of living, will ultimately destroy themselves in their transgressions. The underlying principle here is the notion of 'balance' or 'measure' - that any action that exceeds its appropriate limit (or 'measure') can lead to downfall. \n\nThe verse asserts that those who do not explore other righteous paths, and persist in deceit and fraud, will inevitably face their own ruin. The transgressions committed beyond the limit ('measure') will lead to their own downfall, even in the act of committing them. This verse is a poignant reminder of the importance of ethical conduct and the perils of straying from the path of righteousness. \n\nIn essence, the verse emphasizes the consequences of immoral actions, and serves as a warning to those who choose to live by deceit, highlighting the inevitable self-destruction that follows..The kural verse:கள்வார்க்குத் தள்ளும் உயிர்நிலை கள்வார்க்குத்தள்ளாது புத்தே ளுளகு. ,translates to :Even the body rejects thieves;  The honest men, heaven receives,and it's explantion is :The Kural 290 emphasizes the negative impact of dishonesty and the value of honesty. \n\nThe first line, \"Even their body will fail the fraudulent,\" signifies that those who indulge in deceitful and dishonest practices will eventually face the consequences of their actions. This might not necessarily mean a physical failure but can be interpreted as a failure in terms of their character, reputation, and social standing. Dishonesty leads to a life of fear and anxiety, which can in turn cause physical and mental health issues. It is a reminder that deceit and trickery are never sustainable and will lead to downfall.\n\nThe second line, \"but even the world of the gods will not fail those who are free from fraud,\" emphasizes the rewards of being honest. Those who lead a life of integrity and honesty are not just respected in the human world but are also honored in the divine realm. The phrase \"world of the gods\" symbolizes a state of peace, prosperity, and respect. It means that a life of honesty and integrity will always be rewarded, if not in this world, then in the hereafter.\n\nIn essence, this Kural underlines the moral principle that honesty and integrity are superior virtues that lead to physical, mental, and spiritual well-being, while dishonesty leads to downfall and loss of respect..The kural verse:வாய்மை எனப்படுவது யாதெனின் யாதொன்றும்தீமை இலாத சொலல். ,translates to :If \\\"What is truth\\\"? the question be,  It is to speak out evil-free,and it's explantion is :Kural 291 deals with the essence of truthfulness or honesty, which is one of the most valued virtues in all cultural and moral contexts. According to this verse, true honesty or truthfulness is not just about speaking the truth, but it's about uttering words that do not bring any harm, even in the slightest degree, to others. \n\nIn other words, the verse suggests that the virtue of honesty extends beyond just factual accuracy. It highlights the moral obligation to ensure that our words do not cause damage, pain or distress to others. It reminds us to be mindful of the impact of our words and encourages us to speak in a manner that is not only truthful, but also kind, considerate, and respectful. \n\nThis Kural emphasizes the importance of using speech as a tool for good, avoiding falsehoods, and ensuring that our honesty doesn't serve as a weapon to harm others. It underscores the importance of combining honesty with empathy and compassion in our communication. \n\nTherefore, the true embodiment of honesty, according to Thirukkural, is a speech that is not only truthful but also free from causing harm or distress to others. This is a profound reminder that our words have power and we should use them responsibly..The kural verse:பொய்மையும் வாய்மை யிடத்த புரைதீர்ந்தநன்மை பயக்கும் எனின். ,translates to :E'en falsehood may for truth suffice,  When good it brings removing vice,and it's explantion is :Kural 292 posits a complex ethical consideration. It suggests that even a statement which is not entirely truthful can be considered as truthful if it results in a benefit that is free from any harm or wrongdoing. The concept here is not advocating habitual lying or deceit, but rather acknowledges that there can be situations where a departure from factual truth might lead to a greater good, and in such circumstances, that untruth could be viewed as embodying the nature of truth.\n\nFor example, a white lie told to prevent a larger harm or to confer a significant benefit without causing any harm could be seen as consistent with the principle of truthfulness. The verse emphasizes the overarching importance of the end result being good and free of harm, even if it requires a temporary departure from absolute truth.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean that Thiruvalluvar is promoting dishonesty. He is merely acknowledging the moral complexity that sometimes occurs in life, and suggests that the ultimate gauge of an action's morality is the good it produces and the harm it avoids. But this should be an exception, not a norm. Truthfulness remains a fundamental virtue in Valluvar's ethical system..The kural verse:தன்நெஞ் சறிவது பொய்யற்க பொய்த்தபின்தன்நெஞ்சே தன்னைச் சுடும். ,translates to :Let not a man knowingly lie;  Conscience will scorch and make him sigh,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse emphasizes the importance of truthfulness and the negative impacts of lying. It urges people not to knowingly tell a lie because, once a lie is told, the person's own conscience will torment them with guilt. The verse implies that honesty is not just a moral duty but also a way to maintain inner peace and self-respect. \n\nThe verse acknowledges that our mind is aware of our actions and that it becomes a judge of our own behavior. When we lie, we are not just deceiving others, but also ourselves. The guilt and remorse that follow a lie can cause inner turmoil. This Kural, therefore, serves as a powerful reminder to maintain integrity and honesty in all our actions and words.\n\nThe cultural context here is the high value placed on truthfulness in the Tamil society. This is reflected in the works of the sage poet Thiruvalluvar, who emphasizes the importance of truthfulness in maintaining harmony both within oneself and in society..The kural verse:உள்ளத்தாற் பொய்யா தொழுகின் உலகத்தார்உள்ளத்து ளெல்லாம் உளன். ,translates to :He lives in loving hearts of all  Who serves the Truth serene in soul,and it's explantion is :Kural 294 is a profound verse that emphasizes the importance of sincerity and integrity. It conveys that if a person lives his life without falsehood, not just in his words but also in his thoughts, then he will be respected and remembered in the hearts of all people.\n\nThe key concept here is the absence of deceit, not just in one's actions, but in one's mind. It underlines the importance of mental purity and internal authenticity. This is not merely about being honest in one's speech, but also about maintaining an inner state of truthfulness.\n\nThe verse suggests that such a person, who is genuinely truthful from within, will be appreciated and valued by people around the world. He will have a lasting place in their hearts and minds because truthfulness and sincerity are universally respected virtues. This Kural is a reminder that genuine respect and esteem come from being true to oneself and others at all times. It encourages us to strive for honesty, not just on the outside, but on the inside too. \n\nIn a broader cultural context, this Kural reflects the ancient Tamil ethical and moral values that prized honesty, integrity, and transparency in one's thoughts, words, and deeds. The ideal of a truthful mind as reflected in this Kural continues to be a cornerstone of ethical living and moral conduct..The kural verse:மனத்தொடு வாய்மை மொழியின் தவத்தொடுதானஞ்செய் வாரின் தலை. ,translates to :To speak the truth from heart sincere  Is more than giving and living austere,and it's explantion is :This verse of the Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of truthfulness over acts of charity and religious austerity. The verse suggests that a person who speaks the truth, from the depth of their heart and without any deceit, holds a superior position than those who practice religious austerities and make generous donations. \n\nThe underlying principle here is the value of honesty and integrity. The verse argues that these qualities are more virtuous than performing acts of charity or religious rituals without sincerity. It underlines the idea that no amount of external act of goodness can outweigh the internal virtue of truthfulness.\n\nIn the cultural context, this verse challenges the common belief that acts of charity and religious practices are the highest form of virtue. Instead, it places truthfulness at the pinnacle of moral excellence. \n\nTherefore, the moral interpretation of this verse would be to encourage everyone to uphold truthfulness as the highest virtue, even above acts of charity and religious rituals. It emphasizes the importance of being genuine and sincere in our actions and words..The kural verse:பொய்யாமை அன்ன புகழில்லை எய்யாமைஎல்லா அறமுந் தரும். ,translates to :Not to lie brings all the praise  All virtues from Truth arise,and it's explantion is :Kural 296 emphasizes the profound virtue of truthfulness, stating that there is no greater honor than leading a life devoid of falsehood. This verse asserts that adhering strictly to truthfulness brings unparalleled praise and respect. Moreover, it is a path of righteousness that confers all other virtues to the person, even without their conscious pursuit. It suggests that truthfulness spontaneously attracts all other moral and ethical virtues. \n\nIt underscores the idea that truthfulness is not just about not lying, but it is about living a life of integrity and authenticity. This life choice not only avoids causing harm or suffering to others but also paves the way for a life of virtue and righteousness.\n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse underlines the importance of honesty in maintaining social harmony and personal integrity. It speaks to the power of truth as an instrument of moral and ethical transformation, a tool for personal growth, and a pathway to acquire all other virtues.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, through this verse, encourages everyone to adopt truthfulness as a way of life, not just as an occasional act. He affirms that the path of truth is the path towards all virtues, and it is the highest form of living that brings the utmost respect and honor..The kural verse:பொய்யாமை பொய்யாமை ஆற்றின் அறம்பிறசெய்யாமை செய்யாமை நன்று. ,translates to :Lie not lie not Naught else you need  All virtues are in Truth indeed,and it's explantion is :The verse 297 from Thirukkural is a profound statement on the significance of truthfulness, which is one of the most valued virtues in all cultures and societies. \n\nThe verse implies that if a person possesses the ability to refrain from lying or speaking falsehoods, it is considered a great virtue. Even if he does not practice any other moral or ethical principle, his commitment to truthfulness alone is enough to bring him goodness and prosperity in life. The verse underscores the importance of honesty and implies that it is a fundamental moral principle that can stand on its own.\n\nThe Tamil explanations resonate the same idea emphasizing that abstaining from falsehood can bring immense benefits, even if one does not engage in any other virtuous deeds. Also, they stress the idea that adherence to truthfulness is a path of morality that yields good results. \n\nIn essence, Thirukkural through this verse, holds truthfulness in high esteem, and advocates it as a standalone virtue that brings immense goodness and moral righteousness to a person's life. It highlights the concept that truthfulness not only builds trust and credibility, but also is a virtue that can stand on its own, irrespective of the practice of other virtues..The kural verse:புறள்தூய்மை நீரான் அமையும் அகந்தூய்மைவாய்மையால் காணப் படும். ,translates to :Water makes you pure outward  Truth renders you pure inward,and it's explantion is :Kural 298 emphasizes the importance of both physical and mental purity. Thiruvalluvar, the author, uses water and truthfulness as metaphors to explain the concepts of external and internal purity, respectively.\n\nThe first half of the verse says, \"Purity of body is produced by water.\" Here, Thiruvalluvar uses water as a symbol for hygiene and cleanliness. Just as water cleanses the body of dirt and grime, maintaining physical cleanliness is imperative for one's overall wellbeing. In the context of the society Valluvar lived in, physical purity was not just a matter of personal hygiene, but also had religious and social connotations.\n\nThe second half of the verse states, \"purity of mind by truthfulness.\" This part implies that just as water is essential for physical cleanliness, truthfulness is the key to mental purity. Being honest in our words and actions cleanses our mind of guilt and deceit, leading to inner peace and clarity. It encourages moral integrity, which Valluvar considers as important as physical cleanliness.\n\nThis verse, therefore, underlines the importance of maintaining both physical cleanliness and moral integrity. It suggests that to be truly pure, one must be clean not just in their body, but also in their mind and actions. In other words, purity is a holistic concept that encompasses both the physical and the ethical aspects of human life..The kural verse:எல்லா விளக்கும் விளக்கல்ல சான்றோர்க்குப்பொய்யா விளக்கே விளக்கு. ,translates to :All lights are not lights for the wise;  Truth light is light bright like Sun-light,and it's explantion is :Kural 299 delves into the metaphorical concept of light and darkness in a person's character. The verse states that not all lights that illuminate the physical world are truly lamps. Instead, it emphasizes that the real lamp for the wise is the light of truthfulness.\n\nThe light in this context refers to the virtues and good qualities that a person possesses. The darkness, on the other hand, represents ignorance, deceit, and falsehood. The lamps that dispel the darkness in the physical world can only illuminate our surroundings but cannot penetrate the darkness of ignorance and deceit within our hearts and minds.\n\nThe \"lamp of truth\" here refers to the virtue of honesty or truthfulness. This \"lamp\" dispels the inner darkness of falsehood, leading to enlightenment. The verse suggests that being truthful is the real illumination that makes a person wise. It is the light that guides us on the right path and helps us discern right from wrong.\n\nTherefore, the verse underlines the importance of truthfulness, stating that it is the ultimate light that leads to wisdom. It suggests that being honest and truthful is more important than any other worldly knowledge or materialistic light, as it enlightens our inner self and guides us towards right action and thought..The kural verse:யாமெய்யாக் கண்டவற்றுள் இல்லை எனைத்தொன்றும்வாய்மையின் நல்ல பிற. ,translates to :Of all the things we here have seen  Nothing surpasses Truth serene!,and it's explantion is :Kural 300 emphasizes the supreme importance of truthfulness above all other virtues. This verse asserts that among all the positive attributes and virtues one might observe or experience, none surpasses the value of honesty. \n\nThis principle extols truthfulness as the highest form of virtue, a sentiment that is deeply rooted in Tamil culture, as well as in many other cultures around the world. The Thirukkural, in its wisdom, promotes truthfulness as the foundational principle upon which all other virtues are built. \n\nIn other words, the essence of this verse is that regardless of what other virtues or good qualities one might possess, they are of lesser value if not grounded in truthfulness. It underscores the idea that honesty is not just a virtue, but the very bedrock of ethical and moral character..The kural verse:செல்லிடத்துக் காப்பான் சினங்காப்பான் அல்லிடத்துக்காக்கின்என் காவாக்கால் என்? ,translates to :Anger against the weak is wrong  It is futile against the strong,and it's explantion is :The Kural 301 emphasizes the importance of self-control, specifically in terms of anger management. It suggests that the real test of a person's ability to control their anger is in situations where their anger can cause harm or damage. In such instances, restraining oneself from acting out of anger demonstrates true wisdom and strength.\n\nOn the other hand, it questions the value of controlling one's anger in situations where it cannot do any harm. The implication here is that true restraint is not merely about suppressing emotions in harmless situations, but more significantly about preventing negative outcomes when the stakes are high.\n\nThis verse, hence, encourages the practice of thoughtful restraint, emphasizing the need to manage one's emotions strategically rather than indiscriminately. It underscores the idea that the true measure of one's self-control lies not merely in the ability to suppress emotions, but in the wisdom to do so when it matters most..The kural verse:செல்லா இடத்துச் சினந்தீது செல்லிடத்தும்இல்அதனின் தீய பிற. ,translates to :Vain is wrath against men of force  Against the meek it is still worse,and it's explantion is :Kural 302:\n\nThe verse articulates the perils of anger, considered one of the greatest evils. It suggests that anger is detrimental, even when it is aimed at someone who cannot retaliate or harm us in return. Here, the anger serves no purpose and only breeds negativity, causing harm to us emotionally and spiritually.\n\nThe verse further underscores that when anger is directed at someone who can retaliate or harm us, it becomes even more dangerous. In such a scenario, not only does it create an environment of hostility and conflict, but it also puts us at risk of physical or other forms of harm. \n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes the negative impacts of anger, irrespective of the target. It advocates for self-control and the need to refrain from anger to prevent harm to oneself and others. The verse is a timeless reminder of the importance of equanimity and peace in our interactions with others, regardless of their status or capabilities..The kural verse:மறத்தல் வெகுளியை யார்மாட்டும் தீயபிறத்தல் அதனான் வரும். ,translates to :Off with wrath with any one  It is the source of sin and pain,and it's explantion is :Kural 303 emphasizes the importance of letting go of anger against anyone, regardless of the circumstance. According to Thiruvalluvar, the poet who authored Thirukkural, harboring anger is the source of all evils and leads to harmful consequences. \n\nThe verse suggests that anger can be a destructive emotion that doesn't just affect the one who harbors it, but also those around them. An angry person might act impulsively or irrationally, leading to actions that they might regret later. This could lead to a cycle of negativity, causing harm and distress to self and others.\n\nOn a deeper level, the verse also encourages forgiveness and empathy. By learning to let go of anger, one can foster peace and harmony in their relationships and surroundings. This not only helps to maintain a peaceful mind but also contributes to a harmonious society.\n\nIn essence, the verse advises us to practice self-control and emotional intelligence. It reminds us that our actions borne out of anger can have dire consequences, and therefore, we should strive to overcome this emotion..The kural verse:நகையும் உவகையும் கொல்லும் சினத்தின்பகையும் உளவோ பிற. ,translates to :Is there a foe like harmful ire  Which kills the smile and joyful cheer?,and it's explantion is :Kural 304 emphasizes the destructive power of anger. It suggests that anger is one's worst enemy, as it not only destroys one's pleasant demeanor (expressed as \"smiling face\" in the verse) but also eliminates inner joy. The verse essentially poses a rhetorical question, asking if there exists any other enemy as harmful as anger, that can bring about such a devastating impact on an individual's personality and wellbeing.\n\nIn the cultural context, Thiruvalluvar, the author of Thiru Kural, often highlights the importance of self-control and peaceful co-existence. This verse is part of his teachings on the ill-effects of anger and the significance of managing one's emotions for a harmonious life. It acts as a cautionary note, urging individuals to avoid succumbing to anger, for it can lead to the loss of happiness, peace, and personal relationships. \n\nThe moral interpretation of this verse is clear: one's worst enemy is not an external force, but the unchecked anger within oneself. Therefore, it is crucial to control and manage one's anger to lead a content and peaceful life. This verse serves as timeless wisdom, relevant across cultures and ages, advising self-restraint and emotional intelligence..The kural verse:தன்னைத்தான் காக்கின் சினங்காக்க காவாக்கால்தன்னையே கொல்லுஞ் சினம். ,translates to :Thyself to save, from wrath away!  If not thyself the wrath will slay,and it's explantion is :The Kural 305 explores the destructive power of anger. Anger, according to Valluvar, is a force as lethal as any physical threat. If one wishes to safeguard oneself, the first defence should be against one's own anger. The unchecked wrath not only harms relationships and peace but can also lead to one's own downfall. \n\nThe verse serves as a stark warning against allowing anger to rule one's actions. If not controlled, it can lead to regrettable actions, causing irreversible damage to oneself and others. Thus, in Valluvar's view, mastering one's temper is not just a moral imperative but also a matter of self-preservation. \n\nThe multiple Tamil interpretations essentially convey the same message. They emphasize the need to restrain anger to prevent it from harming oneself. If left unchecked, anger can act as a self-destructive force, leading to personal ruin. \n\nIn essence, this verse underlines the importance of emotional self-control and the dangers of letting anger dictate one's actions. It encourages individuals to practice restraint for their well-being and survival..The kural verse:சினமென்னும் சேர்ந்தாரைக் கொல்லி இனமென்னும்ஏமப் புணையைச் சுடும். ,translates to :Friend-killer is the fatal rage  It burns the helpful kinship-barge,and it's explantion is :Kural 306 asserts the destructive power of anger. It highlights that anger, symbolized as a fire, can not only harm the person who is the object of that anger, but also extends its destructive reach to the bonds of friendship, likened to a raft. This metaphorical raft of friendship is something that provides support, companionship, and joy to an individual, akin to a raft that helps one to navigate turbulent waters.\n\nThe verse warns that anger is so powerful, it can consume and destroy even such a strong and beneficial bond as friendship. It suggests that unchecked anger does not discriminate and harms everything in its path, no matter how pleasant or beneficial it is. \n\nThis verse emphasizes the importance of managing and controlling one's anger. It cautions that letting anger rule over can lead to loss of valuable relationships and can create a path of destruction, burning bridges with not just the person with whom one is angry, but also those associated with them. \n\nIn essence, this verse teaches the importance of emotional intelligence and control over one's emotions for maintaining harmonious relationships and a peaceful life..The kural verse:சினத்தைப் பொருளென்று கொண்டவன் கேடுநிலத்தறைந்தான் கைபிழையா தற்று. ,translates to :The wrath-lover to doom is bound  Like failless-hand that strikes the ground,and it's explantion is :The Kural 307 warns about the destructive consequences of uncontrolled anger. It uses a metaphorical comparison to drive home the point. Just as a hand that strikes the hard ground will inevitably experience pain and harm, a person who regards anger as a useful or beneficial trait will inevitably face destruction and harm. \n\nThis verse underscores the idea that anger is a destructive emotion, and treating it as a virtue or a tool can lead to self-destruction. It underlines the importance of self-control, patience, and calmness. Just as striking the ground hurts one's own hand, succumbing to anger hurts the person who gets angry, often more than it hurts others. The verse advises against using anger as a means to achieve one's objectives and warns that such an approach will only lead to self-inflicted harm. \n\nIn this way, Thiruvalluvar, the author of Thirukkural, advises us to avoid anger and adopt patience and understanding in dealing with situations and people. The verse serves as a reflection on the perils of anger and the wisdom of maintaining peace and tranquility within oneself..The kural verse:இணர்எரி தோய்வன்ன இன்னா செயினும்புணரின் வெகுளாமை நன்று. ,translates to :Save thy soul from burning ire  Though tortured like the touch of fire,and it's explantion is :Kural 308 talks about the power of patience and forgiveness. It advises that even if someone inflicts pain on you, comparable to throwing you into a bundle of fire, it is still better to refrain from anger if you can. The verse emphasizes the virtue and strength in controlling one's anger and maintaining peace.\n\nIn the context of Tamil culture, this verse aligns with the traditional values of tolerance, patience, and forgiveness. It encourages individuals to refrain from retaliation or holding grudges, even in the face of grave provocations. The verse suggests that the ability to control one's anger and maintain peace is a mark of wisdom and moral strength.\n\nThe moral interpretation of the verse is a universal one - advocating for peace and avoidance of conflict. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining inner tranquility and not allowing external actions to disrupt one's peace of mind. This verse encourages individuals to rise above provocations and personal feelings, ultimately promoting harmony and peace in society..The kural verse:உள்ளிய தெல்லாம் உடனெய்தும் உள்ளத்தால்உள்ளான் வெகுளி எனின். ,translates to :Wishes he gains as he wishes  If man refrains from rage vicious!,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes on the power of inner peace and control over anger. The verse translates to \"If a man never indulges anger in his heart, he will at once obtain whatever he has thought of\". \n\nHere, Thiruvalluvar, the poet, is not just underscoring the negative impact of anger but also highlighting the positive outcomes of maintaining inner peace and tranquility. Anger is often a self-destructive emotion that clouds judgement, disrupts clarity of thoughts and leads to actions that one might regret later. On the contrary, maintaining a calm and composed mind enables clear thinking, better decision-making and thus, increases the likelihood of achieving what one desires or has thought of. \n\nThe verse suggests that the absence of anger in one’s heart is not merely a state of emotional balance, but a source of power that can help fulfill one’s desires and ambitions. It conveys that a person who can control his anger is likely to achieve his goals faster than the one who lets anger rule his heart. \n\nIn a broader sense, it advocates for emotional intelligence and self-control, emphasizing that our emotions should be managed and directed towards constructive ends rather than letting them control us. This timeless wisdom is applicable even today in various aspects of life, be it personal relationships, professional endeavors, or spiritual growth..The kural verse:இறந்தார் இறந்தார் அனையர் சினத்தைத்துறந்தார் துறந்தார் துணை. ,translates to :Dead are they who are anger-fed  Saints are they from whom wrath has fled,and it's explantion is :The verse 310 of Thiru Kural states that people who succumb to unbounded anger are as good as dead. This is because such excessive anger blinds one's judgement, disrupts peace, and often leads to regrettable actions, thereby devaluing the quality of life and making it equivalent to death.\n\nIn contrast, those who can conquer and let go of their anger are likened to those who have freed themselves from the grips of death. This signifies that they have attained a more enlightened state of existence. They are able to manage their emotions in a way that does not harm themselves or others. By doing so, they enhance the quality of their lives and make it more meaningful and worthwhile.\n\nThis verse is a reminder of the destructive power of uncontrolled anger and the liberating power of forgiveness and emotional control. It encourages us to master our anger and not let it master us, thus promoting peaceful co-existence and personal growth.\n\nIn essence, the verse emphasizes the value of emotional intelligence and self-control in leading a fulfilling life. It equates the mastery of anger to victory over death, symbolizing the transcendence over one of life's most challenging trials..The kural verse:சிறப்பீனும் செல்வம் பெறினும் பிறர்க்குஇன்னாசெய்யாமை மாசற்றார் கோள். ,translates to :The pure by faith mean pain to none  Though princely wealth by that is won,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse emphasizes the ethical principle of causing no harm to others, even if it could potentially lead to personal gain or elevation in status. The verse asserts that the truly virtuous or 'spotless' individuals firmly adhere to this principle. They refrain from causing suffering or sorrow to others, regardless of the benefits they might reap from such actions. \n\nThe verse implies that wealth and greatness that come at the expense of others' well-being are not worth pursuing. This is a foundational principle in many moral philosophies and religions that advocate for empathy, compassion, and respect for others' rights and dignity. \n\nIn essence, this verse sets a high moral standard, stating that true greatness is not in the wealth or status one acquires, but in the commitment to safeguard the well-being of others, even when one has the power or opportunity to exploit them for personal gains. \n\nThiruvalluvar insists on the moral responsibility of the individual not to inflict pain on others, which is a universal value. The verse encourages us to consider our actions' impacts on others and prioritize ethical conduct over personal gains..The kural verse:கறுத்துஇன்னா செய்தவக் கண்ணும் மறுத்தின்னாசெய்யாமை மாசற்றார் கோள். ,translates to :The spotless hearts seek not revenge  Though Malice does the worst in rage,and it's explantion is :Verse 312 of Thirukkural underscores the virtuous concept of non-retaliation, even in the face of animosity and harm inflicted by others.\n\nIn this verse, Valluvar states that those who are truly virtuous and free from fault do not seek to return harm, even to those who have harmed them out of hostility. This virtue is a testament to their inherent moral strength and integrity. The ability to withstand pain without seeking revenge or stooping to the level of the wrongdoer is held as a high virtue, representative of an individual's moral and ethical stance. \n\nThe verse underscores the importance of forgiveness and tolerance, suggesting that revenge does not resolve conflict but only perpetuates a cycle of harm and hostility. It encourages the reader to rise above the instinct to harm in return, asserting that this restraint is characteristic of those who are truly spotless and virtuous.\n\nIn a broader cultural context, this verse aligns with the non-violent principles found in many spiritual and philosophical traditions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. It promotes the idea of responding to hate with love, and to harm with forgiveness, advocating for peace and understanding over revenge and retribution..The kural verse:செய்யாமல் செற்றார்க்கும் இன்னாத செய்தபின்உய்யா விழுமந் தரும். ,translates to :Revenging even causeless hate  Bad-blood breeds and baneful heat,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the law of karma and the consequence of causing harm to others, even to those who have done wrong to us. The verse asserts that if a person who has not harmed anyone is subjected to harm by his enemies, and he retaliates by causing them hurt, he will eventually face severe sorrow that cannot be averted.\n\nThe context of this verse is grounded in the principle of non-violence and the belief in the cyclical nature of actions, a common theme in many Eastern philosophies. It advises against reciprocating harm with harm, even if the harm is perpetrated by an enemy. The verse suggests that any act of vengeance or retaliation will only result in personal pain and suffering that is irretrievable and unavoidable. \n\nThe verse thus encourages the practice of patience, forgiveness, and non-retaliation. It underlines the importance of maintaining one's moral principles, even in the face of adversity or when provoked by those who bear ill will towards us. \n\nIn essence, this Thiru Kural verse is a reminder that our actions, positive or negative, have consequences, and that choosing the path of non-violence and forgiveness can help us avoid unnecessary sorrow..The kural verse:இன்னாசெய் தாரை ஒறுத்தல் அவர்நாணநன்னயஞ் செய்து விடல். ,translates to :Doing good-turns, put them to shame  Thus chide the evil who do harm,and it's explantion is :The Kural 314 emphasizes the power of kindness and forgiveness. It suggests that the best way to deal with those who inflict harm or evil on you is not to seek revenge, but to respond with kindness. This act of benevolence not only puts them to shame but also prompts them to reflect on their actions.\n\nThe verse further advises to let go of the memory of both the harm caused by them and the kindness shown by you. This is a fundamental concept in cultivating a balanced mind, free from attachments and aversions. By forgetting the harm done, you free yourself from resentment and by forgetting the kindness extended, you prevent the rise of ego.\n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse is an embodiment of the saying \"Kill them with kindness\". It promotes love, compassion, and forgiveness as powerful tools to transform negativity. Furthermore, it underlines the importance of not carrying past grudges and to maintain a state of equanimity, thereby enriching one's mental peace and moral strength..The kural verse:அறிவினான் ஆகுவ துண்டோ பிறிதின்நோய்தந்நோய்போல் போற்றாக் கடை. ,translates to :What does a man from wisdom gain  If he pines not at other's pain?,and it's explantion is :Kural 315 explores the theme of empathy and compassion, essential elements of righteous living. In this verse, Thiruvalluvar questions the worth of knowledge if it does not lead to empathy towards others' sufferings. \n\nThe verse can be understood as follows, \"What is the use of one's knowledge if one does not strive to alleviate the suffering of others as much as they do for themselves?\" It highlights the moral obligation of those with knowledge to use it for the welfare of others.\n\nThe verse implies that the true measure of knowledge is not just intellectual understanding or mastery of a subject, but the ability to empathize with and alleviate the suffering of others. It criticizes those who hoard knowledge for personal gain while ignoring the pain and suffering of others.\n\nIn other words, Thiruvalluvar emphasizes the responsibility of the learned to employ their knowledge for the betterment of society. If knowledge does not lead to compassion and empathy, it is considered futile. \n\nTherefore, the essence of this Kural is that true knowledge should instill a sense of empathy and drive to lessen others' pain, just as one would do for their own. This is the real benefit and purpose of acquiring knowledge..The kural verse:இன்னா எனத்தான் உணர்ந்தவை துன்னாமைவேண்டும் பிறன்கண் செயல். ,translates to :What you feel as pain to yourself  Do it not to the other-self,and it's explantion is :Kural 316 is a moralistic verse that advocates empathy and consideration towards others. It advises against inflicting on others the same pain or sorrow one has personally experienced. \n\nIn essence, this verse urges individuals to abstain from causing harm or distress to others, especially if they themselves have understood and experienced such suffering in their own lives. It promotes a sense of empathy and compassion, urging people not to repeat the actions that have caused them personal anguish.\n\nThis principle aligns with the universal moral rule of \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\". The verse recognizes the importance of personal experiences in shaping our understanding of suffering, and it asks us to use this understanding to avoid causing similar pain to others.\n\nThe verse is a reminder to be mindful of our actions and their potential impact on others, encouraging us to foster kindness, empathy, and respect in our interactions with others. It reminds us that our experiences of pain and sorrow should not only serve as personal lessons but should also guide our treatment of others..The kural verse:எனைத்தானும் எஞ்ஞான்றும் யார்க்கும் மனத்தானாம்மாணாசெய் யாமை தலை. ,translates to :Any, anywhere injure not  At any time even in thought,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes on the embodiment of virtue as the act of refraining from causing harm to any being, regardless of the circumstances. It underscores the idea that the highest form of virtue lies in not even contemplating to inflict pain, be it trivial or significant, at any point in time, to anyone.\n\nThe moral compass of an individual, according to this verse, should firmly point towards compassion and kindness, eschewing all forms of harm. This principle applies universally, irrespective of who the other person is, what time it is, or how insignificant the harm might seem.\n\nIn essence, what this verse is conveying is that true nobility and virtue are demonstrated by not just physically refraining from negative actions but also mentally restraining oneself from harbouring harmful thoughts. Such a person, who neither acts nor thinks harmfully, is indeed the epitome of virtue..The kural verse:தன்னுயிர்ககு ஏன்னாமை தானறிவான் என்கொலோமன்னுயிர்க்கு இன்னா செயல். ,translates to :How can he injure other souls  Who in his life injury feels,and it's explantion is :Kural 318 discusses the principle of empathy and compassion towards all living beings. It questions why a person, who has experienced pain and discomfort firsthand, would inflict the same suffering onto another living creature. \n\nThe verse underscores the universal understanding of suffering - what is painful to oneself is likely to be painful to others. Therefore, if one has personally experienced the pain, they should be all the more reluctant to cause it for others. This principle aligns with the golden rule found in many moral and philosophical traditions: \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\"\n\nThe verse implores individuals to be mindful of their actions and to treat others, including all living creatures, with kindness and respect. It is a call for empathy, an urging to understand and share the feelings of others, based on one's experiences. \n\nThis verse ultimately advocates for non-violence and compassion, emphasizing that causing harm to others is not just unethical but also contradictory to one's personal experiences of pain and discomfort. It serves as a reminder that understanding our own pain should lead us to prevent causing pain to others..The kural verse:பிறர்க்கின்னா முற்பகல் செய்யின் தமக்குஇன்னாபிற்பகல் தாமே வரும். ,translates to :Harm others in the forenoon  Harm seeks thee in afternoon,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural (Verse 319), beautifully embodies the concept of karma, or the law of cause and effect. It highlights the moral principle that one's actions, whether positive or negative, will invariably have consequences that return to the actor. \n\nThe verse metaphorically uses the time of day - morning and evening - to illustrate the immediacy and certainty of these consequences. If one inflicts pain or sorrow on others in the 'morning' - this could be understood as the beginning or early phase of any action or interaction - the repercussions of this act will return to them by 'evening' - symbolizing the end or later stage of the same day's action or interaction.\n\nIn other words, the verse warns against causing harm to others, as the harm one causes will inevitably come back to them, often sooner than they might expect. This moral lesson is universal and echoes across various cultural and religious philosophies, emphasizing the importance of treating others with kindness and respect.\n\nTherefore, the verse is a profound reminder that one should always be cautious of their actions, as they not only impact others but also determine the kind of repercussions one will face in return. It underscores the importance of compassion, empathy, and ethical conduct in human interactions..The kural verse:நோயெல்லாம் நோய்செய்தார் மேலவாம் நோய்செய்யார்நோயின்மை வேண்டு பவர். ,translates to :No harm is done by peace-lovers  For pains rebound on pain-givers,and it's explantion is :Kural 320 is a profound reflection on the principle of karma. The verse suggests that those who inflict pain upon others will inevitably experience pain themselves. This is a universal law of causality, where every action has an equal and opposite reaction. It teaches us that negative actions, such as causing harm to others, will always lead to negative outcomes for the perpetrator.\n\nFurther, the verse instructs those who wish to lead a life free of pain to abstain from inflicting suffering upon others. If we wish to avoid sorrow, we should ensure our actions do not cause sorrow to others. This concept aligns with many moral, ethical, and religious principles worldwide, emphasizing empathy, kindness, and non-violence.\n\nIn essence, this Kural verse teaches us the profound life lesson that we reap what we sow. If we choose to harm others, we invite harm upon ourselves. On the other hand, if our actions are rooted in kindness and empathy, we can expect a life of peace and happiness. Therefore, to lead a life free of suffering, we should strive to cause no harm to others..The kural verse:அறவினை யாதெனின் கொல்லாமை கோறல்பிறவினை எல்லாந் தரும். ,translates to :What is Virtue? 'Tis not to kill  For killing causes every ill,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse (Kural 321) emphasizes on the profound virtue of non-violence and the detrimental consequences of destructive actions. When asked about the highest form of virtue, the verse suggests that it is the act of refraining from causing harm or death to any living being. This principle is deeply ingrained in the ethos of many philosophies and religions, underlining the sacredness of life and the importance of coexistence.\n\nFurther, the verse warns about the repercussions of violent actions, particularly taking a life. It asserts that such an act is not just immoral, but also leads to a multitude of negative outcomes. This can be interpreted in a spiritual context where violent actions lead to negative karma, causing suffering in one's current life or future lives. It could also be understood in a social context where violent behavior disrupts harmony and incurs punishment or social ostracization.\n\nTherefore, the verse serves as a moral guideline, advocating for non-violence and respect for all forms of life, while cautioning against the destructive act of taking a life. It underscores the universal truth that our actions, good or bad, have consequences, and it is through our conduct that we shape our destiny..The kural verse:பகுத்துண்டு பல்லுயிர் ஓம்புதல் நூலோர்தொகுத்தவற்றுள் எல்லாந் தலை. ,translates to :Share the food and serve all lives  This is the law of all the laws,and it's explantion is :The Kural 322 emphasizes the supreme virtue of sharing one's food with others and preserving the lives of all creatures. The verse asserts that this principle of compassion and generosity is the highest of all virtues ascribed by scholars. \n\nSharing food not only represents an act of charity but also promotes a sense of community and kindness. It reflects the ethical value of considering the needs of others before oneself. It is a recognition of our shared humanity and interdependence, promoting social harmony and unity.\n\nPreserving the lives of all creatures is an affirmation of the principle of non-violence. It underscores the belief in the sanctity of all life forms and encourages respect and care towards them. This principle fosters an attitude of reverence for life, promoting peace and harmony in the world.\n\nIn essence, this Kural verse propounds the virtues of sharing and compassion as the highest moral standards. By practicing these virtues, one not only elevates their own moral character but also contributes positively to society and the world at large..The kural verse:ஒன்றாக நல்லது கொல்லாமை மற்றதன்பின்சாரப் பொய்யாமை நன்று. ,translates to :Not to kill is unique good  The next, not to utter falsehood,and it's explantion is :Thirukkural 323 emphasizes two paramount virtues: non-violence and truthfulness. In the hierarchy of virtues, non-violence or not causing harm to any life form is considered the highest good. This principle aligns with the ancient Indian philosophy of Ahimsa, which advocates non-violence towards all living beings. It urges us to respect all forms of life and to refrain from inflicting any harm, physical or mental.\n\nThe second virtue highlighted in the verse is truthfulness or abstention from falsehood. This virtue is ranked next to non-violence. Truth is considered a fundamental value in many cultures and religions, as it forms the basis of trust and integrity in human relationships. By placing truthfulness after non-violence, the verse suggests that while truth is important, it should not lead to harm or pain to others. For instance, speaking truth should not be an excuse for causing harm or hurt to others.\n\nOverall, the verse advocates for a compassionate and honest approach in life, placing the highest importance on not causing harm to any life form and maintaining truthfulness at all times. It is a call to uphold these values which contribute to peace, harmony, and ethical conduct..The kural verse:நல்லாறு எனப்படுவது யாதெனின் யாதொன்றும்கொல்லாமை சூழும் நெறி. ,translates to :What way is good? That we can say  The way away from heat to slay,and it's explantion is :The verse 324 from Thiru Kural emphasizes the principle of Ahimsa (non-violence), which is a fundamental tenet in many philosophies and religions. This verse can be interpreted as: \"What is considered the righteous path? It is the one that scrupulously avoids harming or killing any living being.\"\n\nThe verse is a clear statement on the value and respect for all forms of life. It implies that the highest moral path is the one that refrains from causing harm or destruction to any living creature. This incorporates not only physical harm but also emotional and psychological harm. It urges us to be aware of our actions and their potential impact on others, promoting empathy and compassion towards all beings.\n\nIn a broader context, the verse may also suggest non-violence in our thoughts, words, and actions, advocating for peaceful co-existence. It underscores the principle that true virtue lies in causing no harm intentionally, and in living a life that respects the sanctity of all life forms. This principle of non-violence and respect for life is a cornerstone for ethical conduct and peaceful living. \n\nThus, the verse 324 from Thiru Kural serves as a profound reminder of our moral responsibility to avoid harm and to cherish all life forms..The kural verse:நிலைஅஞ்சி நீத்தாருள் எல்லாம் கொலைஅஞ்சிக்கொல்லாமை சூழ்வான் தலை. ,translates to :Of saints who renounce birth-fearing  The head is he who dreads killing,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural emphasizes the virtue of non-violence and compassion towards all living beings. It states that among those who have renounced worldly desires due to their fear of the eternal cycle of birth and death, the one who stands supreme is the one who fears committing harm or causing the death of any life. This person does not just refrain from physically hurting others, but also consciously thinks about how to prevent harm to any life form.\n\nThe verse highlights the importance of 'Ahimsa', a concept deeply rooted in Indian philosophy, which advocates non-violence and respect for all life. It suggests that true renunciation is not just about giving up material desires, but also about developing a deep sense of empathy and respect for all forms of life. This interpretation resonates with the teachings of many spiritual traditions that emphasize the interconnectedness of all beings and the need to live in harmony with them.\n\nIn essence, the verse extols the virtue of non-violence and compassion, declaring that the highest form of renunciation is not merely an escape from worldly life, but a profound respect and care for all life forms. It advocates a life of non-violence as the highest form of spiritual discipline and ethical living..The kural verse:கொல்லாமை மேற்கொண் டொழுகுவான் வாழ்நாள்மேல்செல்லாது உயிருண்ணுங் கூற்று. ,translates to :Life-eating-Death shall spare the breath  Of him who no life puts to death,and it's explantion is :The Kural 326 underlines the principle of non-violence and the sanctity of life. It suggests that those who make a firm commitment to never take a life, whether human or animal, are shielded from the threat of death itself. The verse personifies Yama, the Hindu god of death, implying that even he hesitates to claim the life of someone who respects and protects the life of others.\n\nThis verse emphasizes the virtue of 'Ahimsa' or non-violence, one of the cardinal virtues in many philosophies and religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The idea is that by fostering a respect for life and refraining from causing harm or death, one can attain a higher moral standing and potentially ward off their own demise.\n\nThe Kural suggests that life, in all its forms, is sacred and should be preserved. It promotes the idea of living in harmony with all living beings, and it proposes that such a way of life can have transformative effects, even to the extent of influencing the natural law of life and death.\n\nIn essence, this verse is a profound call to practice non-violence and respect for all life as a means of safeguarding one's own life. This moral code of conduct is deemed so powerful that even the god of death hesitates before claiming the life of such a person..The kural verse:தன்னுயிர் நீப்பினும் செய்யற்க தான்பிறிதுஇன்னுயிர் நீக்கும் வினை. ,translates to :Kill not life that others cherish  Even when your life must perish,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse talks about the fundamental principle of non-harm. It advises that one must never resort to an action that could potentially harm or take away the life of another being, even if it's a matter of preserving one's own life. \n\nThe verse underscores the value of maintaining respect for all forms of life and discourages any actions that may infringe upon that life. It emphasizes a moral stance that one's survival should not come at the cost of another's existence. This principle aligns with many philosophies and religious teachings that promote non-violence and respect for life.\n\nIn essence, the verse instills the idea of selflessness and compassion for other beings, teaching that a person should not cause harm to others, even in situations of extreme self-preservation. It encourages the practice of empathy and kindness, thus promoting a peaceful co-existence among all living beings..The kural verse:நன்றாகும் ஆக்கம் பெரிதெனினும் சான்றோர்க்குக்கொன்றாகும் ஆக்கங் கடை. ,translates to :The gain of slaughter is a vice  Though deemed good in sacrifice,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of non-violence and respect for life in all its forms. It states that even if a specific action, such as a sacrifice, is said to bring about great benefits or advantages, it is considered dishonorable if it involves taking a life.\n\nThe verse underlines the belief of the wise in the principle of 'Ahimsa' or non-violence. They hold that any benefit drawn from an act of violence, even if it is said to bring about a much larger good, is fundamentally flawed and dishonorable.\n\nThe cultural context here refers to the ancient practice of animal sacrifices in religious rituals, which was believed to bring prosperity and good fortune. However, the verse extols the wisdom of those who shun such practices due to their inherent violence and respect for all living beings.\n\nIn essence, the verse propagates the moral principle that ends do not justify means if those means involve violence or harm to living beings. It holds up the virtue of non-violence and respect for life above all else, even if it contradicts traditional practices or supposed benefits..The kural verse:கொலைவினைய ராகிய மாக்கள் புலைவினையர்புன்மை தெரிவா ரகத்து. ,translates to :Those who live by slaying are  Eaters of carrion bizarre!,and it's explantion is :Kural 329 is a moral commentary on the perception of those who engage in violent acts, specifically murder, as a means of livelihood. The verse suggests that even if such individuals fail to recognize the immorality of their actions, people with wisdom and understanding perceive these violent individuals as engaging in the lowest form of activity.\n\nThe verse implies that murder or any act of violence is considered the vilest of occupations, and those who engage in it are viewed as base and debased. The verse emphasizes the importance of moral discernment. It encourages individuals to understand the implications of their actions not only on a personal level but also on a societal level. \n\nThus, this verse advocates for non-violence and moral integrity, urging individuals to refrain from harmful actions and engage in behavior that is beneficial to society, upholds dignity, and respects the sanctity of life..The kural verse:உயிருடம்பின் நீக்கியா ரென்ப செயிருடம்பின்செல்லாத்தீ வாழ்க்கை யவர். ,translates to :The loathsome poor sickly and sore  Are killers stained by blood before,and it's explantion is :Kural 330 explores the concept of karma and reincarnation, suggesting that the hardships one faces in the present life are often the result of deeds committed in a previous birth. This verse uses the specific example of individuals who live in poverty and suffer from diseases, implying that these hardships are the consequences of taking away the life from animals in their past lives.\n\nIn essence, the verse emphasizes a moral principle: actions have consequences, and those who cause harm to others will eventually face the repercussions of their actions. This can be seen as a warning against causing harm to other living beings and an encouragement to live a life of kindness and compassion.\n\nThe cultural context of this verse is rooted in Hinduism and Buddhism, both of which believe in karma and reincarnation. Karma refers to the law of cause and effect in which one's actions in this life will determine their fate in the next. Reincarnation is the belief in rebirth after death.\n\nTherefore, this verse serves as a moral lesson, urging people to live ethically and treat other living beings with respect and compassion, for one's actions in this life can have far-reaching implications in their next life..The kural verse:நில்லாத வற்றை நிலையின என்றுணரும்புல்லறி வாண்மை கடை. ,translates to :The worst of follies it is told  The fleeting as lasting to hold,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural (Kural 331) emphasizes the pitfalls of ignorance. The verse warns about the dangers of considering transient or temporal things as permanent. It advises people to have the wisdom to differentiate between what is permanent and what is not. \n\nIn life, many things are temporary and fleeting. Wealth, power, fame, and even life itself are transient. However, people often forget this truth, considering these fleeting aspects as stable and permanent. This ignorance can lead to attachments and desires which might, in turn, lead to sorrow and disappointment when these things inevitably change or disappear.\n\nThe wisdom to understand the impermanence of worldly things fosters detachment and equanimity, leading to inner peace and fulfillment. This understanding is seen as honorable and esteemed in a wise person's perspective.\n\nTherefore, the verse encourages the cultivation of wisdom to discern the true nature of things and avoid the dishonor that comes from ignorance. It prompts us to value and seek what is truly enduring and meaningful, such as knowledge, virtue, and inner peace..The kural verse:கூத்தாட்டு அவைக்குழாத் தற்றே பெருஞ்செல்வம்போக்கும் அதுவிளிந் தற்று. ,translates to :Like a drama-crowd wealth gathers  Like passing show its pride too goes,and it's explantion is :Kural 332 uses the analogy of a theatre assembly to illustrate the transient nature of wealth. Just as a crowd gathers to watch a performance and disperses once it ends, wealth accumulates and dissipates in a similar manner.\n\nIn the first half of the Kural, Valluvar compares the acquisition of wealth to the gathering of an audience for a theatre performance. This signifies that wealth, like the crowd, is amassed over time. It doesn't appear magically, but is accumulated through consistent effort and dedication.\n\nThe second half of the Kural likens the expenditure of wealth to the dispersing of the theatre assembly post the performance. This implies that wealth, once spent, cannot be reclaimed, just like the audience can't be brought back once the show is over. It also suggests that wealth is meant to be spent and should not be hoarded unnecessarily.\n\nIn essence, this Kural serves as a reminder of the transient nature of wealth and advises us to manage it wisely. It emphasizes the need to strike a balance between earning and spending, to ensure a stable and secure life..The kural verse:அற்கா இயல்பிற்றுச் செல்வம் அதுபெற்றால்அற்குப ஆங்கே செயல். ,translates to :Wealth wanes away; but when it comes  Take care to do enduring things,and it's explantion is :Kural 333 underlines the transient nature of wealth and advocates for the immediate application of the acquired wealth towards virtuous deeds. In this verse, Thiruvalluvar, the author, suggests that wealth is inherently unstable and impermanent. It can be accumulated and lost in a moment, making it unreliable as a source of lasting happiness or satisfaction.\n\nOn the contrary, virtues embody qualities that are enduring and unchanging. They are the true wealth that individuals should aspire to acquire and practice. Virtuous actions such as kindness, compassion, charity, honesty, and integrity, among others, are lasting and are what truly enrich a person's life.\n\nTherefore, according to Thiruvalluvar, those who gain wealth should recognize its fleeting nature and use it promptly to do virtuous deeds. This implies that the purpose of wealth is not mere accumulation or enjoyment but to enable one to live a virtuous life. Such a life is marked by using wealth for the welfare of others, for personal growth, and for the betterment of society.\n\nIn essence, this verse teaches us that material wealth is secondary to the wealth of virtues, and the former should be used to cultivate and enhance the latter. It is a profound reminder of what truly matters in life and the right way to use our material resources..The kural verse:நாளென ஒன்றுபோற் காட்டி உயிர்ஈரும்வாளது உணர்வார்ப் பெறின். ,translates to :The showy day is but a saw  Your life, know that, to file and gnaw,and it's explantion is :The Kural 334 is a profound verse that portrays time as an inevitable force that constantly diminishes life. It uses a metaphor of a saw to emphasize the relentless and unyielding nature of time.\n\nThe verse suggests that while some may perceive time as a simple progression or a benign entity, the wise understand it as an instrument that gradually 'cuts down' life. Each passing day is like a stroke of a saw, slowly eating away at the span of one's life.\n\nThis interpretation is a reminder of the fleeting nature of life. It encourages us to value each moment and live mindfully, understanding that time, once passed, can never be regained. It also reflects the philosophy of impermanence, a common theme in many spiritual traditions, including Tamil culture.\n\nIn a broader sense, it could also be interpreted as a call to action to make the best use of time, as it is a limited resource that is consistently depleting. The wise ones, who understand this truth, are likely to make conscious decisions to spend their time wisely and purposefully.\n\nOverall, it is a powerful verse that imparts wisdom about the nature of time and life, urging us to live with awareness and intentionality..The kural verse:நாச்செற்று விக்குள்மேல் வாராமுன் நல்வினைமேற்சென்று செய்யப் படும் ,translates to :Ere tongue benumbs and hiccough comes  Rise up to do good deeds betimes,and it's explantion is :The Kural 335 emphasizes the unpredictable nature of life and thus, the urgency to perform good deeds. It uses the metaphor of a 'hiccup', symbolizing death, which abruptly silences the tongue and halts all activities. \n\nThe verse encourages us to act swiftly in doing virtuous deeds before death arrives, leaving no room for regret or unfulfilled intentions. It reminds us of the transient nature of life and urges us to not delay our good actions, as we never know when our time will come to an end. \n\nThe Kural essentially advises us to seize the moment and engage in righteous actions promptly, rather than waiting for a more convenient time that may never come. This aligns with the broader philosophy of Thirukural about leading a virtuous life, emphasizing the importance of acting with kindness, compassion, and wisdom without delay..The kural verse:நெருநல் உளனொருவன் இன்றில்லை என்னும்பெருமை உடைத்துஇவ் வுலகு. ,translates to :One was yesterday; not today!,and it's explantion is :Kural 336 emphasizes the temporary nature of human life and the constant change that is inherent in the world. It highlights the fact that a person who was alive and present yesterday may not be here today, alluding to the inevitability of death. In a broader perspective, this verse is a reminder of the transient nature of all phenomena in the world. \n\nThe world's greatness, as referred to in the verse, is its capacity to perpetually transform and renew itself. It encapsulates the fact that life and death are two sides of the same coin, and this constant cycle is what keeps the world going. The verse encourages the reader to accept this reality and to live in the present, understanding that every moment is fleeting and precious.\n\nThis verse from Thiru Kural serves as a profound reflection on the ephemeral nature of life, urging us to appreciate the present and live our lives with the awareness of our mortality. It's a timeless reminder that nothing is permanent in this world, and everything, including our own existence, is subject to change..The kural verse:ஒருபொழுதும் வாழ்வது அறியார் கருதுபகோடியும் அல்ல பல. ,translates to :Man knows not his next moment  On crores of things he is intent,and it's explantion is :Kural 337 emphasizes the shortsightedness of individuals who fail to realize the fleeting nature of life. These individuals are described as unwise because they do not contemplate the ephemeral quality of existence, that life can end at any moment. Instead, they are preoccupied with endless thoughts and desires, building castles in the air without grasping the fundamental uncertainty of life.\n\nThe verse underlines an important philosophical concept prevalent in many cultures and religions, that of 'mindfulness' or living in the present moment. Instead of being consumed by countless thoughts and desires, one should be aware of the transient nature of life and focus on the present moment.\n\nIn essence, this Kural advises individuals to be conscious of the impermanence of life, urging them to live mindfully and not to get lost in a maze of endless thoughts and desires. It is a reminder to prioritize wisdom and understanding over imprudent desires..The kural verse:குடம்பை தனித்துஒழியப் புள்பறந் தற்றேஉடம்பொடு உயிரிடை நட்பு. ,translates to :The soul from body any day  Like bird from egg-shell flies away,and it's explantion is :The verse 338 from Thiru Kural talks about the transient nature of the human body and the eternal aspect of the soul. This verse compares the relationship between the body and soul to a bird and its egg. \n\nJust like a bird lays an egg, nurtures it for a while, and then eventually leaves it after the chick hatches, the soul too resides in the human body for a period of time, experiences life through it, and eventually leaves it at the time of death. The body, like the egg, is temporary and is left behind when the soul, like the bird, moves on. \n\nThis concept is deeply rooted in the philosophy of reincarnation and karma, prevalent in Indian philosophy, which believes in the immortality of the soul and its cycle of birth and death. \n\nThis verse urges us to realize the impermanence of our physical existence and to focus on the eternal soul, encouraging spiritual growth and detachment from materialistic pursuits. It serves as a reminder that the body is merely a vessel for the soul, and we should not be overly attached to our physical forms but rather seek to nurture and understand our inner selves..The kural verse:உறங்கு வதுபோலுஞ் சாக்காடு உறங்கிவிழிப்பது போலும் பிறப்பு. ,translates to :Death is like a slumber deep  And birth like waking from that sleep,and it's explantion is :The verse 339 of Thirukkural draws a unique comparison between life's two extreme stages - birth and death - with the everyday phenomena of falling asleep and waking up. \n\nHere, Valluvar, the author, likens death to falling into a deep, undisturbed sleep. Just as one is unconscious and unaware during sleep, death too brings about a similar state of oblivion where one is disconnected from the physical world and its experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, birth is compared to the act of waking up from sleep. Just as waking up signifies the start of a new day, filled with fresh experiences and activities, birth is the beginning of a new life, marked by new opportunities, relationships, and learnings.\n\nThis comparison serves to simplify the understanding of birth and death, two profound concepts that are often viewed with complexity and fear. It provides a philosophical perspective on life and death, encouraging us to see them as natural and cyclic processes, just like sleeping and waking up. \n\nIn essence, the Kural teaches us to view death not as an end, but as a temporary pause before the commencement of a new beginning, thereby promoting a sense of acceptance and tranquility towards the inevitable cycle of life and death..The kural verse:புக்கில் அமைந்தின்று கொல்லோ உடம்பினுள்துச்சில் இருந்த உயிர்க்கு. ,translates to :The life berthed in this body shows  A fixed home it never knows,and it's explantion is :Kural 340 explores the transient and impermanent nature of life. The verse metaphorically talks about the soul residing temporarily in the body, like a guest dwelling in a house, implying that life is a temporary state of existence.\n\nThe body is depicted as a temporary residence for the soul, and it is suggested that the soul has not yet found a permanent home. The verse suggests that the soul is still in search of a lasting abode. This reflects the concept of reincarnation and the cycle of birth and death in Hinduism. \n\nThe verse encourages us to reflect on the fleeting nature of life and the impermanence of the physical body. It urges us to focus on the eternal soul, which is the true essence of existence, rather than the temporary physical body.\n\nIn a broader interpretation, it also implies that we should not get too attached to materialistic things or physical attributes, as they are fleeting and temporary. Instead, we should focus on nurturing our soul and striving for spiritual growth and enlightenment, which are eternal..The kural verse:யாதனின் யாதனின் நீங்கியான் நோதல்அதனின் அதனின் இலன். ,translates to :From what from what a man is free  From that, from that his torments flee,and it's explantion is :Kural 341:\n\n\"Whatever thing, a man has renounced, by that thing; he cannot suffer pain.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis verse from Thiru Kural implies the philosophy of non-attachment. It suggests that once a person has renounced a certain desire or attachment, he no longer suffers from the pain that the attachment could cause him. It underlines the concept of freedom from suffering through renunciation or detachment.\n\nIn life, we often get attached to materialistic things or certain desires that we believe can give us happiness. However, these attachments can also lead to suffering if we lose them or if they do not meet our expectations. This verse enlightens us that the best way to avoid such pain is to renounce the attachment towards these things. \n\nPracticing detachment doesn't mean that we should stop enjoying life or avoid worldly pleasures. Instead, it encourages us to enjoy and appreciate everything in life without being overly attached to them. This way, even if we lose them, it doesn't cause us any pain or suffering. \n\nThus, this verse effectively communicates the profound philosophy of non-attachment and freedom from suffering, encouraging us to live a life free from unnecessary pain caused by our attachments..The kural verse:வேண்டின்உண் டாகத் துறக்க துறந்தபின்ஈண்டுஇயற் பால பல. ,translates to :Give up all to gain the True  And endless joys shall hence seek you,and it's explantion is :Kural 342 is a profound verse that propounds a key principle of renunciation and detachment. It suggests that if a person desires a life free from suffering and wishes to experience the manifold joys that life has to offer, they should renounce their attachment to material possessions and worldly desires. This could be a reference to the Buddhist and Hindu concept of detachment where one is encouraged to let go of the cravings for worldly objects to attain inner peace and true happiness.\n\nIn this verse, Valluvar, the author, emphasizes that renunciation should occur while one is still able to enjoy worldly pleasures, implying that it should not be a forced action in the face of inability or despair, but rather a conscious choice made in pursuit of a higher state of being.\n\nOnce a person renounces these desires and attachments, they open themselves up to greater and more profound experiences of joy that are not tied to physical or material possessions. The joy that comes from detachment is not transient or conditional, but rather, it is enduring and unconditional.\n\nThis verse encourages individuals to reflect upon the transient nature of worldly pleasures and to seek a deeper, more enduring state of happiness through detachment and renunciation..The kural verse:அடல்வேண்டும் ஐந்தன் புலத்தை விடல்வேண்டும்வேண்டிய வெல்லாம் ஒருங்கு. ,translates to :Curb the senses five and renounce  The carving desires all at once,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 343, pertains to the chapter on asceticism or renunciation, advocating a life of spiritual discipline and self-control. It provides guidance on how to overcome desires, which are often considered the root cause of suffering and bondage in many philosophical and spiritual traditions.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of mastering the five senses, which are sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell. These senses are the gateways through which we perceive the world and develop desires and attachments. By 'destroying' or gaining control over these senses, the ascetic or spiritual seeker can reduce their susceptibility to worldly desires. \n\nHowever, the verse goes beyond just controlling the senses. It also advises forsaking all that has been formerly desired. This denotes the abandoning of material possessions, past habits, and any worldly attachments that could distract one from the spiritual path. \n\nIn essence, the verse is a call for complete detachment, both internally (from the senses) and externally (from material possessions and desires), as a means to attain spiritual liberation. It underscores that the path of asceticism requires both sensory control and worldly renunciation..The kural verse:இயல்பாகும் நோன்பிற்கொன்று இன்மை உடைமைமயலாகும் மற்றும் பெயர்த்து. ,translates to :To have nothing is law of vows  Having the least deludes and snares,and it's explantion is :This verse speaks about the nature of austerity and the impact of material possessions on individual spiritual pursuits. According to Thiruvalluvar, the ideal state for those practicing austerities, or spiritual disciplines, is one of complete deprivation of material possessions. This is because any form of possession has the potential to distract them from their spiritual path, altering their determination and causing them to return to a state of confusion and attachment.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of renunciation in spiritual growth. It suggests that to truly immerse oneself in spiritual disciplines, one must let go of all worldly possessions. This is not a call for poverty, but rather a call for detachment from materialistic desires, as they can lead to confusion and disruption in one's spiritual journey.\n\nThe verse also highlights the slippery nature of material possessions. If one allows for even a small amount of attachment, it can quickly increase and lead to a state of delusion, thereby hindering spiritual progress. Thus, Thiruvalluvar advises those on a spiritual path to embrace a life of simplicity and non-attachment to stay true to their spiritual pursuits..The kural verse:மற்றும் தொடர்ப்பாடு எவன்கொல் பிறப்பறுக்கல்உற்றார்க்கு உடம்பும் மிகை. ,translates to :Why add to bonds while this body  Is too much for saints to be birth-free,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the philosophy of asceticism, which advocates for the renunciation of worldly desires and materialistic attachments to achieve spiritual liberation. The verse questions the necessity of acquiring more in life when even our own body is considered excessive for those who seek liberation from the cycle of birth and rebirth.\n\nSaint Thiruvalluvar, the author, uses the body as a metaphor for worldly attachments and desires. For those aspiring to renounce the world, even their own body is seen as a burden, as it is the vessel that binds the soul to the earthly realm and its desires. Therefore, for them, the body is 'too much', let alone other possessions or attachments.\n\nThe verse encourages the minimization of one's physical and materialistic desires to focus on spiritual aspirations. This does not necessarily mean physical self-neglect or harm, but rather an understanding and acceptance that the physical entity is temporary and transient. Therefore, the pursuit of spiritual wisdom and liberation should take precedence over worldly acquisitions and attachments.\n\nIn essence, this verse promotes the virtues of simplicity, renunciation, and spiritual focus, key principles in many spiritual and philosophical traditions. It underscores the idea that less is more when it comes to achieving spiritual liberation..The kural verse:யான்எனது என்னும் செருக்குஅறுப்பான் வானோர்க்குஉயர்ந்த உலகம் புகும். ,translates to :Who curbs the pride of I and mine  Gets a world rare for gods to gain,and it's explantion is :Kural 346 delves into the importance of detaching oneself from the ego and materialistic possessions. The verse states that a person who relinquishes the sense of 'I' and 'mine', signifying the ego and attachment to worldly possessions respectively, will attain a state that is superior even to the divine realms.\n\nThe phrase 'I' here symbolizes the ego, the sense of self that confines us within a physical body and mind. 'Mine' refers to the attachment towards materialistic possessions, which binds us to the physical world. The verse emphasizes that only by relinquishing both these forms of attachment, can one achieve a state of consciousness that surpasses even the divine. This is a spiritual state of being that transcends the physical world and its limitations.\n\nIn other words, the verse suggests that the key to attain the highest spiritual planes is to get rid of ego and attachment. This is a common theme in many spiritual philosophies, particularly in Buddhism and Hinduism, which stress on the need for detachment and ego dissolution for spiritual enlightenment. \n\nIn broader terms, this verse also encourages humility and altruism, as the shedding of 'I' and 'mine' implies prioritizing the collective good over personal desires and recognitions. It teaches us to see ourselves as part of a larger whole, rather than individual entities centered around our own needs and wants..The kural verse:பற்றி விடாஅ இடும்பைகள் பற்றினைப்பற்றி விடாஅ தவர் க்கு. ,translates to :Grief clings on and on to those  Who cling to bonds without release,and it's explantion is :This Kural (Verse 347) is a philosophical reflection on the nature of desire and suffering. It states that those who do not let go of their desires will inevitably be held by suffering. The metaphorical use of \"hold\" is significant. Just as one clings to their desires, so too does suffering cling to them. \n\nThe verse is pointing towards a universal truth recognized in many spiritual and philosophical traditions: that desire is the root cause of suffering. When we hold onto desires, we set ourselves up for disappointment and pain because not all desires can be satisfied. Furthermore, even when they are satisfied, they often give rise to new desires, creating a never-ending cycle of desire and dissatisfaction.\n\nIn essence, this verse is a call to develop detachment or dispassion. By letting go of our desires, we free ourselves from the grip of suffering. This does not mean becoming apathetic or indifferent to life, but rather cultivating a sense of contentment and inner peace that is not dependent on external circumstances. \n\nThus, the verse's wisdom lies in its urging to understand the transient nature of desires and the consequent pain they can bring. It encourages us to find joy and satisfaction not in the external, fleeting world of desire, but in the internal, enduring world of self-contentment and peace..The kural verse:தலைப்பட்டார் தீரத் துறந்தார் மயங்கிவலைப்பட்டார் மற்றை யவர். ,translates to :Who renounce all are free from care  Others suffer delusive snare,and it's explantion is :The verse, Kural 348, emphasizes the path of renunciation as a means to attain an enlightened state of being, or absorption into the divine. It highlights the critical role of detachment and renunciation in achieving spiritual liberation.\n\nThe verse states that those who have completely given up desires, worldly possessions, and ego have attained a higher state of consciousness. This is often referred to as 'Moksha' or liberation in Hinduism, where the soul is freed from the cycle of life and death, and merges with the divine entity.\n\nOn the other hand, it contrasts this enlightened state with those who are unable to renounce worldly desires and attachments. These individuals, it says, wander in confusion, entangled in the endless cycle of birth and death, symbolically referred to as a net. Their lack of knowledge and understanding keeps them trapped, unable to attain liberation.\n\nIn essence, this verse underlines the importance of renunciation and detachment from worldly desires as a pathway to spiritual enlightenment and liberation. It warns against the perils of remaining entangled in worldly attachments, which only leads to confusion and an endless cycle of rebirths..The kural verse:பற்றற்ற கண்ணே பிறப்பறுக்கும் மற்றுநிலையாமை காணப் படும். ,translates to :Bondage cut off, rebirth is off  The world then seems instable stuff,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural speaks about the concept of detachment and the resultant liberation from the cycle of birth and death. \n\nIn essence, it conveys that when one relinquishes their desires and attachments, they are freed from the cycle of rebirth, which is characterized by a continuous fluctuation of joy and sorrow. This idea is rooted in the philosophical belief systems of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, where liberation (moksha or nirvana) is achieved by the cessation of desires and attachments, leading to the cessation of the karmic cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.\n\nOn the other hand, if one does not let go of desires and attachments, they remain trapped in the cycle of reincarnation, experiencing the instability of consistent changes and the alternating experiences of happiness and suffering.\n\nThis verse encourages us to cultivate detachment, not just from material possessions but also from intense emotional attachments and desires, to attain a state of stability, peace, and eventually, liberation. It imparts the wisdom that the cessation of desires is the key to end the continuous cycle of birth and rebirth and the accompanying experiences of joy and sorrow..The kural verse:பற்றுக பற்றற்றான் பற்றினை அப்பற்றைப்பற்றுக பற்று விடற்கு. ,translates to :Bind Thyself to the unbound one  That binding breaks all bonds anon,and it's explantion is :Kural 350 speaks about the importance of transcending worldly desires and attachments. It advocates for the pursuit of a divine desire, which is the longing for connection with the Divine, the Supreme Being, or God who is devoid of any worldly attachments or desires.\n\nIn this verse, Thiruvalluvar, the poet, suggests that if one has to have any desire, it should be the desire for union with the Divine. This longing or desire is not a worldly desire but a spiritual one. It is through this divine desire that one can eventually relinquish all other earthly desires and attachments.\n\nThe poet emphasizes that the only way to truly renounce desire, which often leads to suffering and attachment, is to cultivate a stronger, more profound desire - the desire for the Divine. This divine desire is a potent force that could help one overcome other lesser desires, leading towards a path of spiritual liberation and inner peace.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar is encouraging individuals to channel their desires towards a higher spiritual goal. He believes that it is this divine desire that will aid in the renunciation of worldly attachments, leading ultimately to spiritual enlightenment..The kural verse:பொருளல்ல வற்றைப் பொருளென்று உணரும்மருளானாம் மாணாப் பிறப்பு. ,translates to :That error entails ignoble birth  Which deems vain things as things of worth,and it's explantion is :Kural 351 delves into the concept of discernment and its impact on the quality of one's life. The verse warns against the confusion or delusion that leads a person to perceive unreal things as real. This inability to discern truth from falsehood results in a life that lacks honor and respect. This can be interpreted both in a materialistic and spiritual sense. \n\nIn a materialistic context, it could refer to the pursuit of transient worldly pleasures and material wealth, mistaking them for the ultimate reality. Such a life leads to dishonor as it is devoid of inner peace and fulfillment.\n\nIn a spiritual context, the verse highlights the fundamental spiritual ignorance where one fails to recognize the eternal soul or the divine reality, mistaking the physical world for the ultimate truth. This ignorance leads to a cycle of birth and death characterized by suffering and lack of enlightenment.\n\nTherefore, the verse emphasizes the importance of discernment and wisdom to differentiate the real from the unreal, truth from falsehood. It implies that a life lived in wisdom and truth is honourable, while a life shrouded in ignorance and delusion leads to dishonor..The kural verse:இருள்நீங்கி இன்பம் பயக்கும் மருள்நீங்கிமாசறு காட்சி யவர்க்கு. ,translates to :Men of spotless pure insight  Enjoy delight devoid of night,and it's explantion is :The Kural 352 emphasizes the importance of clarity and understanding in life. The verse suggests that having a clear, unclouded vision, or understanding, of the realities of life can liberate individuals from the darkness of ignorance and the cycle of rebirth. This understanding leads to spiritual enlightenment, which is equated with the joy or bliss of heaven.\n\nThe verse metaphorically refers to the darkness as ignorance or misconceptions and the light as knowledge or truth. It underlines the philosophical idea in Hinduism that overcoming ignorance leads to Moksha or liberation from the cycle of birth and rebirth.\n\nThe \"clear, undimmed vision of things\" can be interpreted as the ability to see and understand the world as it is, without being clouded by prejudices, biases, or misconceptions. It is about gaining a deep understanding of the realities of life, which includes understanding the nature of the self, the world, and the divine.\n\nOnce this clear vision is achieved, it eliminates the darkness of future births, meaning it liberates one from the cycle of life and death, which is considered the ultimate goal in Hindu philosophy. It also leads to the attainment of heavenly bliss or spiritual enlightenment, which is the state of ultimate happiness and peace.\n\nIn essence, the verse is a call for gaining knowledge and understanding to free oneself from ignorance and achieve spiritual enlightenment..The kural verse:ஐயத்தின் நீங்கித் தெளிந்தார்க்கு வையத்தின்வானம் நணிய துடைத்து. ,translates to :To doubtless minds whose heart is clear  More than earth heaven is near,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 353, underlines the spiritual progress of individuals who have purified their minds and freed themselves from doubt. The 'heaven' referred in this verse is metaphorical, representing a state of higher consciousness or enlightenment.\n\nThe line \"Heaven is nearer than earth to those men of purified minds who are freed from doubt\" denotes that individuals who rid themselves of ignorance (often represented by doubt), attain a state of clarity and wisdom. They are in a sense, closer to the state of enlightenment or 'heaven', than they are to the worldly or materialistic concerns of the 'earth'. Their understanding of truth and the universal principles makes them transcend the physical realm, bringing them closer to the higher spiritual realm.\n\nThe term 'purified minds' signifies the state of mind free from negative emotions like greed, anger, and jealousy and is filled with virtues like love, compassion, and understanding. The 'freedom from doubt' suggests a clear understanding of the truth, which comes from introspection, self-realization, and spiritual growth.\n\nIn essence, this verse is a metaphorical representation of spiritual elevation. It emphasizes that those who have attained self-realization and inner purity, the spiritual realm or 'heaven' is much nearer to them compared to the physical world or 'earth'. They are closer to the state of enlightenment, peace, and bliss, having transcended worldly concerns and doubts..The kural verse:ஐயுணர்வு எய்தியக் கண்ணும் பயமின்றேமெய்யுணர்வு இல்லா தவர்க்கு. ,translates to :Knowledge of five senses is vain  Without knowing the Truth within,and it's explantion is :The Kural 354 talks about the importance of discerning the true nature of things beyond superficial understanding. It emphasizes that knowledge attained merely through the five senses - sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch, has limited value if it is not complemented by a deeper understanding and perception of the inherent truth of matters.\n\nThis Kural underlines the significance of intuitive wisdom, critical thinking, and spiritual insight, which extends beyond physical sensory perception. It suggests that those who rely solely on their five senses for knowledge may miss the underlying truth or essence of things. Such a superficial understanding, devoid of profound insight, is described as being of no use, regardless of how comprehensive it may seem.\n\nFundamentally, the verse advocates for a balanced approach to knowledge acquisition, integrating both sensory inputs and insightful discernment. It encourages us to seek a deeper, more holistic understanding of the world around us, rather than relying solely on our physical senses. This wisdom, in turn, can lead to more enlightened decision-making, better judgment, and a more meaningful and fulfilling life..The kural verse:எப்பொருள் எத்தன்மைத் தாயினும் அப்பொருள்மெய்ப்பொருள் காண்பது அறிவு. ,translates to :Knowledge is truth of things to find  In every case of every kind,and it's explantion is :Kural 355 emphasizes the importance of discerning the true essence or nature of any object or situation, rather than just relying on its apparent or superficial aspects. This is defined as true knowledge or wisdom.\n\nEvery object, concept, or situation has an external appearance and an inherent, deeper nature. True knowledge is not about understanding or acknowledging the superficial or visible characteristics but grasping the underlying truth or essence. \n\nIn simpler terms, this Kural encourages us to not judge a book by its cover. It advises us to delve deeper and understand the core truth, rather than forming opinions or making decisions based on the surface level information. \n\nFor instance, a glittering object might not necessarily be gold, or a person showing kindness might not genuinely be kind-hearted. The verse promotes critical thinking and deep analysis to discern the truth. \n\nThis principle is applicable in various aspects of life, including decision making, problem-solving, understanding human behaviors, and learning new concepts. It's a reminder to look beyond appearances and seek truth, which is the cornerstone of wisdom and knowledge..The kural verse:கற்றீண்டு மெய்ப்பொருள் கண்டார் தலைப்படுவர்மற்றீண்டு வாரா நெறி. ,translates to :Who learn and here the Truth discern  Enter the path of non-return,and it's explantion is :Kural 356 delves into the realm of spiritual wisdom and the ultimate liberation from the cycle of birth and death. This verse emphasizes the significance of true understanding and the attainment of knowledge regarding the fundamental nature of existence, often referred to as the \"True Being\" in spiritual parlance.\n\nThe verse suggests that those who have learned and realized the true essence of life, the eternal and unchanging reality behind the transient material world, in their present birth, will attain a state of enlightenment. This enlightenment is described as a \"road which returns not into this world\", symbolizing liberation or 'Moksha', a state where the soul is free from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.\n\nIn other words, those who comprehend the ultimate truth about life and existence in this birth itself, live their life in such a manner that they do not have to return to this world of impermanence and suffering. This understanding guides them to lead a virtuous and righteous life, aligning themselves with the universal principles, thereby ensuring their liberation from the cycle of reincarnation.\n\nThis verse underscores the importance of spiritual wisdom, self-realization, and the pursuit of enlightenment for a fulfilling and purposeful life, leading to ultimate liberation. The essence of this verse is deeply rooted in the philosophical concepts of karma, dharma, moksha, and the transient nature of life that are prevalent in Indian spiritual traditions..The kural verse:ஓர்த்துள்ளம் உள்ளது உணரின் ஒருதலையாப்பேர்த்துள்ள வேண்டா பிறப்பு. ,translates to :One-minded sage sees inner-truth  He is free from thoughts of rebirth,and it's explantion is :Kural 357 explores the profound concept of liberation or Moksha, which is a key aspect of many Indian philosophies, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. In this verse, Valluvar asserts that once a person fully comprehends and realizes the Ultimate Truth or the Divine Being, there is no need for them to undergo the cycle of rebirth.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of introspection, understanding, and realization. It urges individuals to deeply ponder over the teachings they have received about the Ultimate Truth. This is not just an intellectual understanding but a deep, personal realization that transforms one's perception of life and existence.\n\nOnce this realization occurs, Valluvar suggests that the individual transcends the cycle of birth and death. This is because they have understood the ephemeral nature of physical existence and identified with the eternal, unchanging Ultimate Reality. \n\nSo, in essence, this verse conveys that true enlightenment, which comes from a deep understanding and realization of the Ultimate Reality, liberates one from the cycle of birth and death, freeing them from the suffering and impermanence of physical existence..The kural verse:பிறப்பென்னும் பேதைமை நீங்கச் சிறப்பென்னும்செம்பொருள் காண்பது அறிவு. ,translates to :It is knowledge to know Self-Truth  And remove the folly of birth,and it's explantion is :Kural 358 provides a philosophical perspective on human life and knowledge. It postulates that true knowledge is the liberation from the ignorance that leads to the cycle of birth, and the realization of the ultimate truth or reality.\n\nThe term \"birth\" in the verse is not just a physical birth, but a metaphorical representation of the cycle of life, death, and rebirth - a concept deeply ingrained in Hindu philosophy, known as Samsara. This cycle is believed to be driven by ignorance (avidya) or the lack of knowledge about our true nature.\n\nThe verse suggests that the elimination of this ignorance, which is the cause for the cycle of birth, is a sign of true knowledge or wisdom. It emphasizes that one should strive to understand the ultimate reality or truth, often referred to as Brahman in Hindu philosophy, which is beyond worldly pleasures and sufferings and is the ultimate state of bliss or heaven.\n\nSo, the Kural encourages readers to seek knowledge that leads to the realization of this ultimate truth, which is a way to liberation or Moksha, freeing oneself from the cycle of birth and death. This knowledge is not merely academic or intellectual, but a profound understanding and realization of the true nature of life and existence..The kural verse:சார்புணர்ந்து சார்பு கெடஒழுகின் மற்றழித்துச்சார்தரா சார்தரு நோய். ,translates to :Know the Refuge; off with bondage  Be free from ills of thraldom, O sage,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of understanding the true essence of life and abandoning worldly desires to attain inner peace and liberation from suffering.\n\nThe verse suggests that the root cause of all sufferings is the attachment to materialistic pleasures and desires. To be free from this suffering, one must first understand the transient nature of these worldly pleasures. When we perceive the divine force or the ultimate truth that is the foundation of all things, we can see past the illusions of worldly desires. \n\nOnce this understanding is achieved, we can consciously let go of our attachments, which are the primary source of our pain and suffering. By doing so, we free ourselves from the cycle of pain and pleasure that constantly affects our peace of mind. \n\nIn essence, it teaches us that understanding the futility of materialistic attachments and consciously choosing to abandon them will lead to liberation from the sorrow they bring. This idea is not just the core of Thiru Kural but also a central theme in many spiritual philosophies and teachings worldwide..The kural verse:காமம் வெகுளி மயக்கம் இவ்மூன்றன்நாமம் கெடக்கெடும் நோய். ,translates to :Woes expire when lust, wrath, folly  Expire even to name, fully,and it's explantion is :The Kural 360 emphasizes the eradication of three fundamental negative aspects - desire, anger, and confusion of mind, to eliminate the sorrows that stem from them. \n\n\"Desire\" here represents excessive longing or craving for something, which often leads to unrealistic expectations and dissatisfaction. \"Anger\" denotes the loss of control over one's emotions, which often leads to destructive behavior and strained relationships. Lastly, \"confusion of mind\" signifies a lack of clear understanding or perception, which often leads to poor decision-making and regrets.\n\nThe verse underscores the idea that these three aspects, when left unchecked, can lead to various forms of distress and unhappiness in life. However, if one can train themselves to control their desires, manage their anger, and strive for clarity of thought, they can effectively negate the adverse effects that these aspects could otherwise have on their life. \n\nIn essence, the verse motivates individuals to strive for a balanced and controlled mind that is free from excessive desire, uncontrolled anger, and confusion. Such a state of mind will not only prevent the onset of various problems but will also enhance one's ability to lead a peaceful and content life..The kural verse:அவாஎன்ப எல்லா உயிர்க்கும் எஞ்ஞான்றும்தவாஅப் பிறப்பீனும் வித்து. ,translates to :Desire to all, always is seed  From which ceaseless births proceed,and it's explantion is :Kural 361 provides an insightful view on the nature of desire. According to this verse, desire is described as a seed that germinates and grows into the tree of life, producing an unending cycle of birth for all beings at all times. \n\nThis is a metaphorical representation of the role desire plays in driving life forward. Just as a seed is the beginning of a plant, desire is the root of all actions and existence. It is the primary force that propels every creature into existence and continues to guide their actions throughout their life. \n\nThe reference to 'unceasing births' and 'all times' symbolizes the pervasive and perpetual nature of desire. It exists across all species, and transcends the boundaries of time. No matter the epoch, desire remains a constant, driving force in life. \n\nHowever, this verse also subtly hints at the potential dangers of unchecked desire. Just as a seed can either grow into a nourishing tree or a destructive weed, desire too can lead to positive outcomes or cause immense suffering, depending on how it is managed.\n\nThe wisdom in this verse is a reminder to recognize and control our desires, because they are the seeds that shape our life and destiny. Uncontrolled desire can lead to a relentless cycle of birth and death, while mindful desire can lead to enlightenment and liberation. \n\nTherefore, the Thiru Kural suggests that understanding and managing one's desires is central to navigating the journey of life..The kural verse:வேண்டுங்கால் வேண்டும் பிறவாமை மற்றதுவேண்டாமை வேண்ட வரும். ,translates to :If long thou must, long for non-birth  It comes by longing no more for earth,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural essentially speaks about the concept of liberation from the cycle of birth and death, also known as 'Moksha' in Hindu philosophy. It emphasizes that if one has to desire anything, then it should be the freedom from rebirths. This can be achieved by cultivating a state of being free from desires.\n\nIn the first line, Valluvar states that if we are to desire anything in life, it should ideally be the liberation from the cycle of birth and death. He presents a profound spiritual concept that the ultimate aim of human life should be to attain Moksha, which is considered the highest state of spiritual enlightenment.\n\nIn the second line, he elaborates on how to attain this liberation. He suggests that one can attain freedom from rebirths by desiring to be without desires. This might seem paradoxical, but it underscores the philosophy that desires are the root cause of human suffering, and thus, the cycle of birth and death. Hence, by eliminating desires, one can attain liberation.\n\nThis verse is a reminder to prioritize spiritual enlightenment over materialistic desires. It encourages us to seek liberation and to cultivate a state of contentment and peace by eliminating desires, thus leading us to the path of Moksha..The kural verse:வேண்டாமை அன்ன விழுச்செல்வம் ஈண்டில்லைஆண்டும் அஃதொப்பது இல். ,translates to :No such wealth is here and there  As peerless wealth of non-desire,and it's explantion is :Kural 363 emphasizes the virtue of desirelessness as the greatest wealth one can possess. It is a philosophical reflection on the concept of detachment, advocating for liberation from wants as the path to true contentment and peace.\n\nThe first half of the verse, \"வேண்டாமை அன்ன விழுச்செல்வம் ஈண்டில்லை\", translates to \"There is no wealth in this world equal to freedom from desire.\" This signifies that the most precious asset one can acquire is not material wealth but the state of being free from desires and wants. It suggests that the pursuit of material wealth often leads to dissatisfaction and restlessness, while renouncing desires brings inner peace and tranquility. \n\nThe second half of the verse, \"ஆண்டும் அஃதொப்பது இல்\", translates to \"Even in the other world, there is nothing like it.\" This refers to the spiritual realm or the life after death, depending on one's personal beliefs. It implies that even in the spiritual realm, the state of being free from desire is considered the greatest wealth. It reinforces the idea that true contentment and peace come from within, not from external possessions or achievements.\n\nIn summary, this Kural teaches us that the highest form of wealth is the state of being free from desires. It encourages us to practice detachment and desirelessness as a way to achieve true peace and contentment, both in this world and in the spiritual realm..The kural verse:தூஉய்மை என்பது அவாவின்மை மற்றதுவாஅய்மை வேண்ட வரும். ,translates to :To nothing crave is purity  That is the fruit of verity,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 364, is a profound reflection on purity of mind. It essentially says that the true purity lies in freedom from desire, which is indeed the ultimate result of truthfulness or love for truth.\n\nTo dissect it further, the verse puts forth two interconnected ideas. First, it defines purity of mind as being devoid of desires. This could be interpreted as the absence of selfish, materialistic, or ulterior motives that often cloud our judgement and actions. When we free our mind from such desires, we're able to think, act, and live more authentically and selflessly.\n\nThe second part of the verse goes on to suggest that this state of desirelessness or purity of mind is achieved through the love for truth. This implies that when we earnestly seek and embrace truth in all aspects of life, we naturally distance ourselves from superficial desires. The pursuit of truth helps us recognize the transient and often deceptive nature of worldly desires and thus, leads us towards a more serene and pure state of mind.\n\nIn essence, this verse from Thiru Kural teaches us that purity of mind comes from freeing ourselves from desires and this freedom can be gained through the love and pursuit of truth. It encourages us to live a truthful and desire-free life for achieving mental purity..The kural verse:அற்றவர் என்பார் அவாஅற்றார் மற்றையார்அற்றாக அற்றது இலர். ,translates to :The free are those who desire not  The rest not free in bonds are caught,and it's explantion is :The verse 365 of Thiru Kural states that the only individuals truly free from the cycle of birth and death are those who have relinquished their desires. Regardless of what else they may have renounced or what other freedoms they might enjoy, if individuals still harbor desires, they are not genuinely free.\n\nIn the context of ancient Indian philosophical and spiritual traditions, this verse emphasizes the importance of overcoming desire to attain liberation (moksha or nirvana). The consumption of desires is believed to bind the soul to the material world, causing it to undergo the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. \n\nTherefore, Thiruvalluvar, through this verse, is highlighting the importance of detachment and renunciation of desires as a pathway to ultimate liberation and freedom. This is a common theme in several spiritual philosophies, where desire is seen as the root of all suffering and the cause of our continued entanglement in the material world. \n\nIn summary, Kural 365 suggests that true freedom is not merely about renouncing material possessions or worldly ties, but about letting go of our desires and cravings. This, according to Thiruvalluvar, is the key to breaking the cycle of birth and death, and achieving true liberation..The kural verse:அஞ்சுவ தோரும் அறனே ஒருவனைவஞ்சிப்ப தோரும் அவா. ,translates to :Dread desire; Virtue is there  To every soul desire is snare!,and it's explantion is :Kural 366 emphasizes the need for self-control and caution against the force of desire. It highlights that the most important duty of an individual, particularly one pursuing a spiritual or ascetic path, is to guard against desires with vigilant fear. This is because desire is portrayed as a powerful and deceptive force that can lead to one's downfall. \n\nThe verse implies that desire can be a destructive force, capable of deceiving an individual and causing their ruin. It suggests that one should live in cautious awareness of this, avoiding becoming a slave to their desires. This cautiousness towards desire is seen as a moral duty, especially for those who are on a spiritual path, as it can distract them from their goal of self-realization or enlightenment.\n\nThus, the verse advocates for a life of self-restraint and discipline, warning against the dangers of unchecked desire. It promotes the idea that maintaining control over one's desires is a cornerstone of moral and spiritual development..The kural verse:அவாவினை ஆற்ற அறுப்பின் தவாவினைதான்வேண்டு மாற்றான் வரும். ,translates to :Destroy desire; deliverance  Comes as much as you aspire hence,and it's explantion is :Kural 367 deals with the concept of relinquishing desires to achieve a state of immortality or eternal peace. Here, Thiruvalluvar, the author of Thiru Kural, highlights the importance of overcoming worldly desires and attachments for the attainment of a higher spiritual state.\n\nThe verse suggests that if a person could completely eradicate all forms of desire, then the actions that lead to an eternal and untroubled life - often referred to as immortality - would naturally come to him. These actions are not sought out of avarice or ambition, but they spontaneously occur in the course of one's life when there are no selfish desires to cloud one's judgment and actions.\n\nIn simpler terms, the verse implies that once a person frees themselves from the shackles of desire, they naturally perform deeds that are pure, righteous, and beneficial for the self and others. This state of desirelessness does not mean inactivity or apathy. Rather, it leads to inspired and selfless action that contributes to the well-being of oneself and the world around, thus leading to a state of peace or immortality.\n\nThe cultural context here is deeply rooted in the Indian philosophical understanding of desire as the root cause of suffering. By cutting off desire, one can attain a state of peaceful existence, free from the cycle of birth and death, which is the ultimate goal of life according to various Indian philosophies..The kural verse:அவாஇல்லார்க் கில்லாகுந் துன்பம் அஃதுண்டேல்தவாஅது மேன்மேல் வரும். ,translates to :Desire extinct no sorrow-taints  Grief comes on grief where it pretends,and it's explantion is :Kural 368 speaks about the correlation between desire and sorrow. It states that those who are free from desires do not encounter any form of sorrow. This is because, without desire, there are no unfulfilled wants or needs that could lead to disappointment and pain. \n\nOn the contrary, when there is desire, sorrow tends to follow it like a shadow. The more one desires, the more one opens oneself to the possibility of not achieving what is desired. This unfulfillment leads to sorrow, which tends to increase as one's desires grow. This kural doesn't necessarily imply that all desires are harmful but rather emphasizes the concept of detachment and satisfaction with what one has. \n\nThe philosophy present in this Kural aligns with many spiritual teachings around the world that advocate the reduction of worldly desires to minimize suffering. It promotes a life of contentment and peace, devoid of insatiable desires, as the path to true happiness. \n\nThus, this verse encourages a life of simplicity and contentment, teaching us that the key to a sorrow-free life may lie in the art of being desire-less..The kural verse:இன்பம் இடையறா தீண்டும் அவாவென்னும்துன்பத்துள் துன்பங் கெடின். ,translates to :Desire, the woe of woes destroy  Joy of joys here you enjoy,and it's explantion is :This Thirukkural verse 369 emphasizes the role of desire in causing suffering and the lasting joy that comes from overcoming it. The verse suggests that desire, often referred to as the root of all sorrows, when eliminated from our minds, paves the way for uninterrupted joy, even while living in the physical body. This joy is not fleeting or temporal, it is a sustained state of contentment that arises from the absence of desire.\n\nThe verse reflects the ancient Indian philosophy that views desires as the cause of all human suffering. It aligns with the teachings of many spiritual schools that advocate for a life of detachment and contentment, rather than chasing after ephemeral pleasures. The ultimate freedom, according to this philosophy, is to be free from desire itself. In this state, one experiences a deep, enduring joy unaffected by external circumstances.\n\nHence, the verse underscores the importance of mastering the mind and overcoming desires to experience a life of everlasting happiness..The kural verse:ஆரா இயற்கை அவாநீப்பின் அந்நிலையேபேரா இயற்கை தரும். ,translates to :Off with desire insatiate  You gain the native blissful state,and it's explantion is :Kural 370 emphasizes the power of eliminating desires, which are by nature insatiable. It suggests that the act of overcoming one's unquenchable desires can lead to a state of being that is unchanging and filled with lasting happiness.\n\nIn the first line of the verse, Thiruvalluvar speaks about the nature of desires. Desires are depicted as never being satisfied, no matter how much we try to fulfill them. This is a reflection of human nature where we tend to want more, no matter how much we already have.\n\nThe second line of the verse provides the solution to this problem. It suggests that eliminating such desires can lead to a state of unchanging nature. This state of being is one of contentment, happiness, and peace, which is unaffected by external circumstances. It is a state where one is not swayed by materialistic wants or worldly pleasures.\n\nIn essence, the Kural teaches us that the key to lasting happiness and contentment lies in overcoming our insatiable desires. When we learn to be satisfied with what we have and let go of our endless wants, we attain a state of being that is stable, peaceful, and filled with joy. This state, once achieved, is unchanging and lasting. This is a timeless piece of wisdom that is as relevant today as it was when it was written..The kural verse:ஆகூழால் தோன்றும் அசைவின்மை கைப்பொருள்போகூழால் தோன்றும் மடி. ,translates to :Efforts succeed by waxing star  Wealth-losing brings waning star,and it's explantion is :The Kural 371 speaks about the interplay of personal effort and destiny, suggesting that the state of one's fate significantly influences one's level of effort and diligence. It implies that a favourable fate encourages perseverance and hard work, while an adverse fate often leads to idleness or inaction.\n\nThe first line, \"Aakoozhalaal thoanrum asaivinmai,\" points out that the absence of laziness or the presence of industriousness often results from a prosperous fate. This suggests that when one's destiny is favourable, it naturally fuels their motivation and instills a sense of perseverance in them. They work tirelessly, without weariness.\n\nThe second line, \"Kaipporul pookoozhalaal thoanrum mati,\" suggests that idleness or laziness is a result of an adverse fate. This implies that when fate is against someone, it often leads to a lack of motivation or effort, resulting in inactivity or laziness.\n\nIn essence, this Thiru Kural emphasizes the role of fate in shaping our attitudes towards work and effort. It neither completely relies on destiny nor undermines the importance of individual effort. Instead, it beautifully blends the two, suggesting that our fate can influence our attitude towards work, but it is our perseverance and diligence that ultimately leads to success or failure..The kural verse:பேதைப் படுக்கும் இழவூழ் அறிவகற்றும்ஆகலூழ் உற்றக் கடை. ,translates to :Loss-fate makes a dull fool of us  Gain-fate makes us prosperous, wise!,and it's explantion is :Kural 372 delves into the philosophical aspect of fate and its influence on human characteristics, specifically knowledge and folly. It suggests that our fortunes or misfortunes are not just a result of our actions, but they also greatly affect our wisdom and ignorance respectively.\n\nWhen the verse says, \"An adverse fate produces folly\", it implies that when a person is constantly met with failures, hardships, and unfavorable circumstances, it might lead to the development of ignorance or folly. This could be because continuous adversities might discourage the person from seeking knowledge or wisdom, or it might deprive them of the opportunities to gain such wisdom.\n\nOn the contrary, \"a prosperous fate produces enlarged knowledge\" signifies that when a person consistently experiences success, prosperity, and favorable circumstances, it fosters the growth of their knowledge and wisdom. This could be because prosperity can provide more opportunities for learning and enlightenment, or because success might encourage the person to seek more knowledge and become wiser.\n\nIn essence, this Kural verse highlights the profound impact of fate on our intellectual growth or decline. However, it's important to note that this verse should not be used as an excuse for ignorance or lack of effort in seeking knowledge. It's a philosophical observation rather than a rule, and it emphasizes the importance of adapting to our fate while continuously striving for knowledge and wisdom, irrespective of our circumstances..The kural verse:நுண்ணிய நூல்பல கற்பினும் மற்றுந்தன்உண்மை யறிவே மிகும். ,translates to :What matters subtle study deep?  Levels of innate wisdom-keep,and it's explantion is :Thirukkural 373 emphasizes the power of inherent wisdom and destiny over acquired knowledge. It suggests that regardless of how many refined books one may read and how much theoretical knowledge one may acquire, the understanding and wisdom that one is destined to have will prevail.\n\nThis Kural brings into focus the difference between knowledge that is obtained from books and the wisdom that is inherent to a person's nature or bestowed upon them by fate. It stresses the idea that while bookish knowledge can be vast and deep, it cannot surpass the innate wisdom and understanding that a person is destined to possess. \n\nThe verse encourages the understanding that wisdom is not merely the accumulation of knowledge from external sources, but also the inherent understanding and perception of the world that is unique to each individual. It subtly underlines that one's destiny plays a significant role in determining the kind of wisdom one possesses, and this may not necessarily align with the knowledge one accumulates from books.\n\nIn essence, while education and learning are valuable, they do not necessarily define the extent of a person's wisdom. The true essence of wisdom goes beyond the realms of bookish knowledge and is often influenced by factors beyond our control, such as destiny and natural intuition..The kural verse:இருவேறு உலகத்து இயற்கை திருவேறுதெள்ளிய ராதலும் வேறு. ,translates to :Two natures in the world obtain  Some wealth and others wisdom gain,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural emphasises on the diverse natures of the world, particularly in terms of wealth and knowledge acquisition. It suggests that the natural order of the world is such that some individuals are destined to be wealthy, while others are destined to be knowledgeable. \n\nThe verse acknowledges the existence of fate and how it influences the distribution of wealth and knowledge among individuals. Some people are naturally inclined towards material wealth and spend their lives accumulating it. On the other hand, some people are drawn towards intellectual wealth and spend their lives in pursuit of knowledge and wisdom. \n\nHowever, it does not mean one is superior to the other. Both wealth and knowledge have their respective places and roles in life. Wealth is necessary for physical sustenance and comfort, while knowledge enhances understanding and wisdom. The difference is based on the natural order of the world, and not on personal merit or virtue.\n\nThirukkural here teaches us to respect this diversity and understand that each person has a unique path. It encourages acceptance, as these differences are a result of the world's natural order and not a matter of individual choice. It promotes the idea of coexistence and harmony among individuals with differing fortunes and capabilities..The kural verse:நல்லவை எல்லாஅந் தீயவாம் தீயவும்நல்லவாம் செல்வம் செயற்கு. ,translates to :In making wealth fate changes mood;  The good as bad and bad as good,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse (375) speaks about the role of fate or destiny in the acquisition of wealth. It suggests that even the most favorable circumstances can turn unfavorable, and seemingly unfavorable situations can become favorable, all due to the power of fate.\n\nIn the pursuit of wealth, a person may take all the right steps, make all the right decisions, and yet, due to the capricious nature of fate, these actions might not lead to the desired outcome. This is the idea conveyed by the phrase \"every thing favourable becomes unfavourable\". It highlights the unpredictability of life and the limitations of human effort. \n\nConversely, the verse also asserts that \"everything unfavourable becomes favourable\". This means that sometimes, even in adverse conditions, where one's efforts seem to be in vain, one may unexpectedly acquire wealth. This underlines the unexpected benevolence of fate.\n\nIn essence, this Thiru Kural verse emphasizes the powerful role of destiny in human endeavors, particularly in the acquisition of wealth. It reminds us that while our actions are important, they are not the sole determinants of our success or failure. The outcomes of our efforts are also significantly influenced by the unpredictability of fate or destiny..The kural verse:பரியினும் ஆகாவாம் பாலல்ல உய்த்துச்சொரியினும் போகா தம. ,translates to :Things not thine never remain  Things destined are surely thine,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse, Kural 376, emphasizes the role of destiny or fate in human life. It underlines the concept that no matter how diligently one tries to hold onto something that is not destined for them, it will eventually slip away. Conversely, what is destined to be theirs will remain with them, even if they were to carelessly throw it away.\n\nThe verse captures the unpredictability and uncontrollable nature of life. It tells us that we cannot control everything, and that some things are out of our hands, governed by fate or destiny. This understanding can help us reduce our worries and anxieties, as we realize that certain outcomes are beyond our control.\n\nHowever, this verse does not advocate fatalism or passivity, but it simply encourages acceptance of things beyond our control. It reminds us to work hard and do our best, but to also accept that the final outcome is not always in our hands.\n\nIn a broader cultural context, the verse represents the ancient Tamil wisdom that recognizes the role of fate in human life while also advocating for personal effort and responsibility. The verse balances the two opposing forces of destiny and personal effort, teaching us to maintain a balanced perspective in life..The kural verse:வகுத்தான் வகுத்த வகையல்லால் கோடிதொகுத்தார்க்கு துய்த்தல் அரிது. ,translates to :Who crores amass enjoy but what  The Dispenser's decrees allot,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural is a profound commentary on the concept of destiny and the limitations of human control over wealth and material possessions. \n\nThe verse translates to: \"Even if one amasses wealth in the millions, they can only enjoy it as it has been decreed by the ultimate disposer of all things. To enjoy wealth as per one's own wishes is difficult.\"\n\nThis verse emphasizes that no matter how much wealth one gathers, its enjoyment and utilization are determined by fate, or divine providence. The 'disposer' here can be understood as a divine force or destiny that determines the course of our lives. \n\nThe verse implies that human beings, despite their efforts and intelligence, do not have complete control over their lives. There is a larger cosmic order or divine plan that governs our lives, including our wealth and how we get to use it. \n\nIt subtly reminds us to be humble, acknowledging the role of fate in our lives. It also warns against excessive attachment to material wealth, as its possession and enjoyment are not entirely in our hands. \n\nIn essence, this verse teaches us to strive and work hard, but with an understanding and acceptance of the larger cosmic order and destiny..The kural verse:துறப்பார்மன் துப்புர வில்லார் உறற்பாலஊட்டா கழியு மெனின். ,translates to :The destitute desire will quit  If fate with ills visit them not,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse 378 suggests that poverty often becomes a hindrance in the path of asceticism or renunciation. The poor, or the destitute, would willingly renounce material desires and adopt a life of asceticism if they were not constantly struggling with the trials and tribulations brought about by their poverty. The verse emphasizes the impact of circumstances on a person's ability to follow a spiritual path.\n\nThe underlying principle here is that true renunciation arises not from the lack of material wealth but from the lack of desire for it. However, the constant struggle for basic necessities in life can make this spiritual goal challenging to achieve for those in poverty. \n\nThus, the verse subtly critiques societal structures that leave some people in poverty, making it hard for them to transcend material concerns and realize higher spiritual potentials. It points to the need for a fair and equitable society where each individual has their basic needs met, thus having the freedom to pursue spiritual goals if they so choose..The kural verse:நன்றாங்கால் நல்லவாக் காண்பவர் அன்றாங்கால்அல்லற் படுவ தெவன்? ,translates to :Who good in time of good perceive  In evil time why should they grieve?,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse explores the human tendency to rejoice in times of prosperity and despair in times of adversity. The question raised by the verse is why individuals feel distressed during challenging times when both good and bad times are part of life's journey, dictated by fate or karma.\n\nThe verse implies that life is a mix of both good and bad times, both of which are inseparable and inevitable. It encourages the reader to maintain equanimity in both situations, suggesting that those who celebrate during good times should not be disturbed or troubled during the difficult periods. The good times and bad times are both part of the same cycle of life and one should not judge them separately.\n\nThe underlying moral of this verse is to maintain a balanced mindset in life. Rather than being overjoyed in times of prosperity and devastated in times of adversity, one should accept both as part of life's natural order. By doing so, one can achieve peace of mind and resilience in the face of life's ups and downs..The kural verse:ஊழிற் பெருவலி யாவுள மற்றொன்றுசூழினுந் தான்முந் துறும். ,translates to :What power surpasses fate? Its will  Persists against the human skill,and it's explantion is :Kural 380 explores the concept of fate and its relentless power that surpasses any human effort. This verse asks a rhetorical question - \"What is stronger than fate?\" It then goes on to explain that even if we devise a strategy or a plan to avert or change our fate, fate itself will already be present there before we even begin to act upon our plan.\n\nThis verse illustrates the idea that fate or destiny, as believed in many cultures, is an inevitable force that cannot be easily altered by human actions. It implies that whatever is destined to happen will happen, regardless of the measures we take to prevent or change it.\n\nIn addition, this verse can also be interpreted as a philosophical commentary on the unpredictability of life. It teaches the wisdom of acceptance and humility in the face of life's uncertainties and the futility of trying to control or predict everything in our lives.\n\nThis Kural does not advocate fatalism or inaction, but rather it emphasizes the importance of understanding our limitations in the grand scheme of life and the universe. It also encourages us to focus on our actions and responsibilities, without being overly concerned or anxious about the outcomes which are beyond our control..The kural verse:படைகுடி கூழ்அமைச்சு நட்பரண் ஆறும்உடையான் அரசருள் ஏறு. ,translates to :People, troops, wealth, forts, council, friends  Who owns these six is lion of kings,and it's explantion is :Kural 381 emphasizes the essential components that make a ruler powerful and respected among other leaders. These six elements are: a robust and loyal army, responsible and caring citizens, abundant wealth, wise and trusted ministers, dependable friends, and a secure fortress. \n\nThe \"army\" represents the ruler's strength and ability to protect and defend his kingdom. \"People\" refers to the citizens who are the backbone of any kingdom; their loyalty, dedication, and support are crucial for a ruler. \"Wealth\" is necessary to provide for the welfare of the citizens, maintain the army, and support the state's functioning. \n\n\"Ministers\" symbolize wise counsel and strategic thinking, guiding the ruler in governance and decision-making. \"Friends\" here refers to allies and friendly kingdoms, who can offer support during challenging times. Finally, a \"fortress\" represents the security and stability of the kingdom, a stronghold that can resist invasions and protect the people.\n\nA ruler possessing all these six elements is regarded as a \"lion among kings,\" signifying a leader who stands out for his strength, wisdom, and the respect he commands among other rulers. This metaphor of a lion, the king of the jungle, underscores the authoritative and formidable nature of such a ruler..The kural verse:அஞ்சாமை ஈகை அறிவூக்கம் இந்நான்கும்எஞ்சாமை வேந்தர்க் கியல்பு. ,translates to :Courage, giving, knowledge and zeal  Are four failless features royal,and it's explantion is :This Kural (verse 382) gives a profound character sketch of a ideal leader or ruler. The verse states that an exemplary leader should embody four key qualities: fearlessness, generosity, wisdom, and vitality.\n\nFearlessness is the courage to face challenges and threats without hesitation. A leader should be bold and unafraid to confront injustice. This trait ensures that they stand for truth and justice, despite the odds.\n\nGenerosity or liberality is the willingness to give without expecting anything in return. A true leader should be magnanimous, always ready to help those in need. This trait not only earns respect but also creates a sense of loyalty among followers.\n\nWisdom is the ability to make sound decisions based on knowledge and understanding. A wise leader can foresee the consequences of actions and plan accordingly. This foresight helps them to navigate through complex situations and make the best decisions for their people.\n\nEnergy or vigor signifies the relentless drive and enthusiasm a leader must possess. This is the ability to maintain enthusiasm and effort, even in the face of adversity. This trait motivates followers and helps to achieve the set goals.\n\nThus, this verse states that a true leader is one who possesses fearlessness, generosity, wisdom, and energy, all without any compromise. This combination of qualities is what defines kingly character..The kural verse:தூங்காமை கல்வி துணிவுடைமை இம்மூன்றும்நீங்கா நிலனான் பவர்க்கு. ,translates to :Alertness, learning bravery  Are adjuncts three of monarchy,and it's explantion is :Kural 383 emphasizes the essential attributes that a ruler or leader should possess. These attributes are vigilance, learning, and bravery. \n\nVigilance suggests a state of being alert and watchful, particularly in the face of potential danger or difficulty. It is the unceasing attention to what is happening around one's environment. A vigilant ruler is able to foresee issues and address them proactively, ensuring the safety and well-being of his people.\n\nLearning refers to acquiring knowledge through study, experience, or being taught. A learned ruler is one who possesses deep and broad knowledge, enabling him to make informed decisions. His wisdom gained through learning allows him to guide his people effectively, and his understanding of various fields makes him a versatile leader.\n\nBravery is the quality of having courage. This courage is not only physical but also moral - the ability to do what is right even in the face of adversity. A brave ruler is one who is undeterred by challenges and threats, willing to take bold steps for the greater good of his people.\n\nThe Kural asserts that these three qualities - vigilance, learning, and bravery - should be ever-present in a ruler. They are not only desirable attributes but also necessary ones for effective governance and leadership. A ruler lacking in any of these qualities may lead his country into chaos and disorder. Hence, these qualities should remain unwavering, sustaining the ruler and, by extension, the land he governs..The kural verse:அறனிழுக்கா தல்லவை நீக்கி மறனிழுக்காமானம் உடைய தரசு. ,translates to :A brave noble king refrains from vice  Full of virtue and enterprise,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse 384 essentially describes the characteristics of an ideal king or ruler. According to the verse, a true king is one who adheres steadfastly to virtue and refrains from indulging in any form of vice. He maintains his integrity and upholds his dignity, never straying from the path of righteousness. \n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of modesty and valor in a ruler. He should be strong and courageous, but at the same time, he should also be modest and humble. He should not let power corrupt him or lead him into wrongdoing. \n\nFurthermore, the verse also suggests that a worthy ruler is one who not only refrains from vice himself but also strives to eradicate it from his kingdom. He should have zero tolerance for any form of immorality or injustice within his reign. \n\nOverall, the verse extols the virtue of moral governance and underscores the need for rulers to be paragons of virtue and justice. It serves as a timeless guideline for leadership, advocating for rulers who are strong yet humble, firm yet fair, and above all, committed to upholding virtue and justice..The kural verse:இயற்றலும் ஈட்டலுங் காத்தலும் காத்தவகுத்தலும் வல்ல தரசு. ,translates to :The able king gets, stores and guards  And spends them for people's safeguards,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the ideal qualities of a king, or broadly, a leader. It highlights four essential skills that a leader should possess: the ability to generate wealth, to accumulate it, to protect it, and to distribute it appropriately.\n\n1. Ability to generate wealth: A good leader should be capable of creating resources or wealth. This could mean fostering an environment that encourages economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.\n\n2. Ability to accumulate wealth: Beyond creating wealth, a leader should know how to accumulate it. This involves strategic planning, saving, and investing wisely for future needs and emergencies.\n\n3. Ability to protect wealth: A leader must ensure the security of the accumulated wealth. This can mean physical protection against theft or loss, but it can also mean protecting the wealth from being eroded away by factors such as inflation, corruption, or mismanagement.\n\n4. Ability to distribute wealth: Lastly, a true leader knows not just to accumulate wealth but also to distribute it wisely. This involves using the wealth for the welfare of the people, for infrastructure development, welfare schemes, education, healthcare etc.\n\nEssentially, this verse emphasizes the importance of financial management in leadership. A leader who can skillfully handle these aspects of wealth is considered a successful and effective one. In a broader interpretation, these principles can also apply to anyone managing resources, not just a king or a leader..The kural verse:காட்சிக் கெளியன் கடுஞ்சொல்லன் அல்லனேல்மீக்கூறும் மன்னன் நிலம் ,translates to :That land prospers where the king is  Easy to see, not harsh of words,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural emphasizes the importance of approachability and courteous speech in a ruler. According to Valluvar, the world will celebrate and respect the reign of a king who is easily accessible and refrains from using harsh or bitter language.\n\nThe first line of the Kural, 'easy of access,' implies that the ruler should always be ready to listen to the grievances and suggestions of his subjects. The king should not be secluded or distant, but should be approachable and willing to interact with the people he rules. This creates a sense of trust and respect among the subjects towards their ruler.\n\nThe second line, 'free from harsh language,' signifies the importance of the ruler's speech. A ruler should refrain from using harsh or offensive words, instead using gentle, polite and encouraging language. This implies that the ruler is considerate and respectful of his subjects, which in turn can earn him their love and loyalty.\n\nIn essence, the verse extols the virtues of accessibility and soft-spokenness in a leader. It suggests that these qualities can elevate the status of a kingdom, earning it respect and admiration from across the world. In a broader context, this verse can be applied to leaders in any field, emphasizing the importance of being receptive and respectful to those they lead..The kural verse:இன்சொலால் ஈத்தளிக்க வல்லார்க்குத் தன்சொலால்தான்கண் டனைத்திவ் வுலகு. ,translates to :The world commends and acts his phrase  Who sweetly speaks and gives with grace,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural, written by Thiruvalluvar, emphasizes the significance of affability and protection provided by a ruler to his subjects. The verse asserts that a king who is both gracious in his speech and generous in his actions, who also protects those under his governance, is revered and respected by the world. \n\nThe term 'affability' here refers to the king's cordial and polite manner of speech. It suggests that a king should not be harsh or rude, but rather, should approach his subjects with kindness and understanding. This affable demeanor helps in establishing a strong rapport with subjects and enhances the king's reputation.\n\nThe verse also underscores the importance of the king's role as a protector. The king is expected to protect his subjects from harm and provide them with the necessary support. This protective nature, when combined with generosity and affable speech, makes the king a beloved and respected figure. \n\nThe world, in turn, acknowledges such a benevolent and protective ruler, and willingly submits to his rule. The king's name is praised, and his fame spreads far and wide. Thus, the verse highlights the importance of a ruler's character and actions in earning the respect and admiration of his subjects and the world at large..The kural verse:முறைசெய்து காப்பாற்றும் மன்னவன் மக்கட்குஇறையென்று வைக்கப் படும். ,translates to :He is the Lord of men who does  Sound justice and saves his race,and it's explantion is :Kural 388 asserts the importance of a ruler in fulfilling his duties and safeguarding his subjects. This verse highlights the role of a king as a protector and an upholder of justice. \n\nThe king, according to this verse, is not just a figurehead, but an active participant in the welfare and safety of his subjects. He is expected to perform his duties with integrity and fairness, ensuring that his subjects are protected from harm and injustice. \n\nThis kural also underscores the reverence people have for a ruler who fulfills his responsibilities. Such a ruler is esteemed as a 'God among men.' This is not just for the power he wields, but for his just and fair rule, which creates a peaceful and prosperous kingdom. \n\nThus, the verse brings to light the ideals of good governance, emphasising the role of a ruler as a protector of his subjects and an upholder of justice and fairness. The king who does so is not just respected, but revered and worshipped like a deity. His rule becomes an example of virtuous governance, inspiring loyalty and devotion among his subjects..The kural verse:செவிகைப்பச் சொற்பொறுக்கும் பண்புடை வேந்தன்கவிகைக்கீழ்த் தங்கும் உலகு. ,translates to :Under his shelter thrives the world  Who bears remarks bitter and bold,and it's explantion is :Kural 389 emphasizes the importance of patience and resilience for a leader or king. The verse states that the world will willingly take shelter under the rule of a king who possesses the capacity to tolerate harsh or bitter words that might be unpleasant to his ears.\n\nIn this context, 'words that embitter the ear' could refer to criticism, disagreement, or difficult truths. The ability to tolerate these without reacting impulsively or negatively is a hallmark of a great leader. Such a leader does not shun dissenting voices but listens to them, absorbing any truth or wisdom they may contain. This quality of forbearance speaks volumes about the leader's character, earning respect and loyalty from his subjects.\n\nThe metaphor of the 'world dwelling under the umbrella of the king' signifies the widespread acceptance and support the king will receive from his people, neighboring kingdoms, and perhaps even from his adversaries. This is because the king's patience and resilience demonstrate his capacity to maintain a balanced perspective and make judicious decisions even under stress or provocation.\n\nTherefore, this verse teaches us that tolerance and patience are not signs of weakness but strength, especially in positions of leadership. It also underscores the importance of open-mindedness and the ability to handle criticism constructively..The kural verse:கொடையளி செங்கோல் குடியோம்பல் நான்கும்உடையானாம் வேந்தர்க் கொளி. ,translates to :He is the Light of Kings who has  Bounty, justice, care and grace,and it's explantion is :Kural 390 speaks about the four essential qualities of a true king or leader. These are beneficence, benevolence, rectitude, and care for his people.\n\nBeneficence refers to the act of providing what is needed for the welfare of the people. A good leader is generous and willing to give to ensure the well-being of his subjects. This is not just about material gifts, but also about providing opportunities, guidance, and support to help the people grow and prosper.\n\nBenevolence is about kindness and compassion. A true leader has empathy for his people, understands their problems and needs, and takes actions that are in their best interest. He treats everyone with kindness and does not let his personal feelings or biases influence his decisions.\n\nRectitude is about fairness and justice. A good ruler maintains a just and balanced administration. He treats everyone equally, regardless of their social status or personal background. He ensures that justice is served and that everyone's rights are protected.\n\nLastly, a good leader genuinely cares for his people. He values their well-being above everything else, and works tirelessly to protect them from harm. He listens to their concerns, understands their needs, and takes appropriate actions to address them.\n\nA leader who embodies these four qualities is considered the \"light of kings\", as he guides his people towards prosperity and happiness. His leadership shines brightly, setting an example for others to follow. He earns the respect and love of his people, and leaves a lasting legacy of good governance..The kural verse:கற்க கசடறக் கற்பவை கற்றபின்நிற்க அதற்குத் தக. ,translates to :Lore worth learning, learn flawlessly  Live by that learning thoroughly,and it's explantion is :Kural 391 emphasizes the importance of thorough and comprehensive learning and the need to translate that knowledge into action. It advises that a person must strive to learn without any omissions or errors, and the learning process should eliminate the individual's deficiencies to the maximum extent possible. The knowledge gained should not be mere bookish knowledge or theoretical understanding, it needs to be applied practically in everyday conduct. \n\nThe verse further underscores that one's behavior and actions must reflect the wisdom and knowledge they have acquired. It is not enough to acquire knowledge; the real essence of learning is in its application. The knowledge that has been learned should guide a person's actions and behavior, making them worthy of their learning.\n\nIn essence, this verse advocates for the harmonious alignment of knowledge and action. Learning should not be an end in itself, but a means to improve one's conduct and way of life. It encourages us to learn thoroughly and then live up to that learning through our actions and behavior..The kural verse:எண்ணென்ப ஏனை எழுத்தென்ப இவ்விரண்டும்கண்ணென்ப வாழும் உயிர்க்கு. ,translates to :Letter, number, art and science  Of living kind both are the eyes,and it's explantion is :Kural 392 states \"Letters and numbers are the two eyes of man.\" This verse is a metaphorical affirmation of the importance of knowledge and education in human life. It compares the acquisition of knowledge, specifically in the form of literacy and numeracy, to the vital sense of sight. \n\nIn this context, letters and numbers represent all forms of knowledge. Letters stand for language, literature, and all forms of written knowledge, while numbers represent mathematical and logical understanding. Together, they encompass a wide spectrum of human knowledge.\n\nJust as our eyes allow us to perceive the world, understand our environment, and navigate through life, knowledge gives us the ability to comprehend the world around us, make sense of complex situations, and make informed decisions. Without this 'sight' or knowledge, one would be metaphorically blind in the world, unable to fully understand or engage with it.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that those who are equipped with this knowledge, who have these 'two eyes', are the ones truly living. This is because they can fully appreciate, contribute to, and navigate the world with understanding and wisdom. This verse, thus, underscores the significance of education and the pursuit of knowledge as a means to a fulfilling and enlightened life..The kural verse:கண்ணுடையர் என்பவர் கற்றோர் முகத்திரண்டுபுண்ணுடையர் கல்லா தவர். ,translates to :The learned alone have eyes on face  The ignorant two sores of disgrace,and it's explantion is :The Kural 393 is a metaphorical verse that highlights the value of knowledge and learning. According to the verse, those who are learned are said to truly \"have eyes\", highlighting the idea that knowledge and wisdom give one the ability to see and understand the world in a way that those without knowledge cannot. \n\nThe verse underscores that the value of eyes is not in their physical existence, but in the understanding and perception they offer. Eyes are symbolic of awareness and understanding here. Hence, the learned, despite being physically blind, are considered to have eyes because they possess knowledge.\n\nOn the other hand, it refers to the unlearned as those with \"merely two sores in their face\", meaning that without knowledge and wisdom, even the physical eyes are of no use. They are likened to sores, serving no purpose, because they lack the insight and understanding that comes with learning. \n\nIn essence, this verse is a powerful commentary on the importance of knowledge and the pursuit of learning. It asserts that true sight comes not from the physical eyes, but from the understanding and wisdom gained through learning..The kural verse:உவப்பத் தலைக்கூடி உள்ளப் பிரிதல்அனைத்தே புலவர் தொழில். ,translates to :To meet with joy and part with thought  Of learned men this is the art,and it's explantion is :Kural 394 emphasizes the impact of one's presence and the impression it leaves upon others. It suggests that a learned person, or a person of wisdom and knowledge, should be able to bring joy to those they encounter. Their companionship should be so uplifting and enjoyable that when they part, others should feel a sense of longing, wondering when they will have the pleasure of their company again.\n\nThis Kural essentially highlights the importance of spreading positivity and leaving a lasting, positive impact on others. The learned are not just known for their knowledge and intellect, but also for their ability to make others feel good in their presence. They have a unique ability to inspire, motivate, and spread joy. Their departure should make people miss their company and look forward to their return.\n\nIn a broader sense, this Kural teaches us the value of good companionship and urges us to strive to be someone who not only imparts knowledge and wisdom but also leaves a positive, memorable impression on others. It's not just about being intelligent or knowledgeable, but also about how we use that knowledge to improve the lives of those around us..The kural verse:உடையார்முன் இல்லார்போல் ஏக்கற்றுங் கற்றார்கடையரே கல்லா தவர். ,translates to :Like poor before rich they yearn:  For knowledge: the low never learn,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural highlights the importance and value of knowledge and education. It compares the unlearned or uneducated to the poor who stand before the rich begging for alms. Just like how the destitute are considered inferior to the wealthy, those who lack knowledge are seen as inferior to those who are learned.\n\nThe verse also points out that those who have the desire to learn and carry forward the quest for knowledge are esteemed and respected, similar to the wealthy. On the other hand, those who do not make an effort to learn, despite opportunities, are regarded as lowly and inferior. \n\nThis verse emphasizes that knowledge is the ultimate wealth that uplifts a person's status more than material wealth. It underscores the notion that ignorance is a form of poverty and that the pursuit of knowledge is a duty and responsibility for all individuals. Thus, it encourages everyone to strive for learning and enlightenment. \n\nOverall, this verse is a profound reminder of the power of knowledge and education in transforming lives and society. It advocates for continuous learning and intellectual growth as the pathway to personal and societal elevation..The kural verse:தொட்டனைத் தூறும் மணற்கேணி மாந்தர்க்குக்கற்றனைத் தூறும் அறிவு. ,translates to :As deep you dig the sand spring flows  As deep you learn the knowledge grows,and it's explantion is :Kural 396 draws a beautiful analogy between the acquisition of water from a well dug in the sand and the flow of knowledge from an individual. \n\nAccording to the verse, the depth of a well determines the quantity of water it will yield. The deeper the well is dug in the sand, the more water it can provide. This is likened to an individual's acquisition of knowledge. The more a person learns or the deeper they delve into the realms of knowledge, the more wisdom they can impart to others. \n\nThe kural emphasizes that knowledge and learning are not static, but grow and expand with consistent effort, much like the water in a well. It also suggests that the depth and breadth of one's understanding and wisdom are directly proportional to the effort put into learning.\n\nAs water is drawn from the well to nourish life, knowledge drawn from a person can enlighten others and enrich their lives. Thus, this kural encourages continuous learning and sharing of knowledge for the betterment of oneself and society..The kural verse:யாதானும் நாடாமால் ஊராமால் என்னொருவன்சாந்துணையுங் கல்லாத வாறு. ,translates to :All lands and towns are learner's own  Why not till death learning go on!,and it's explantion is :Kural 397 emphasizes the importance and value of learning and knowledge. The verse asserts that to a learned person, every country is his own, and every town is his own. This means that knowledge and learning are universal; they are not confined to any particular place or culture. As such, they provide a sense of belonging and acceptance wherever one goes. \n\nThe question posed in the verse is rhetorical, questioning how anyone can choose to remain unlearned until their death. It implies a sense of disbelief and incredulity at the idea of someone willingly choosing to stay ignorant when the benefits of learning are so profound. \n\nIn essence, this verse extols the virtues of learning, emphasizing that knowledge can make the whole world your home, erasing boundaries and fostering mutual understanding and acceptance. It also calls out willful ignorance as a detrimental choice, questioning why anyone would opt to remain unlearned when there is so much to gain from acquiring knowledge..The kural verse:ஒருமைக்கண் தான்கற்ற கல்வி ஒருவற்குஎழுமையும் ஏமாப் புடைத்து. ,translates to :The joy of learning in one birth  Exalts man upto his seventh,and it's explantion is :Kural 398 emphasizes the enduring and multi-life benefits of education. The verse suggests that the knowledge one acquires in a single lifetime can bring joy and advantages not only in the present birth but also in the subsequent seven lifetimes. This concept is rooted in the belief in reincarnation, which is prevalent in many Indian religions. \n\nThe verse implies that true knowledge is not ephemeral but leaves a lasting impression on the soul, transcending the physical boundaries of one lifetime. This is a profound statement about the power and value of learning, suggesting that it's not just a tool for worldly success, but a spiritual asset that follows the soul through its journey across multiple births.\n\nThe Kural also underlines the importance of gaining knowledge for the self rather than just for mundane, societal validations. The acquired wisdom helps to shape one's character, broaden the perspective, and improve decision-making abilities, thereby enhancing the quality of life in the present and future lifetimes. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, the author, encourages the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom as they are the treasures that will always accompany the soul, providing guidance and joy through the cycles of birth, death, and rebirth..The kural verse:தாமின் புறுவது உலகின் புறக்கண்டுகாமுறுவர் கற்றறிந் தார். ,translates to :The learned foster learning more  On seeing the world enjoy their lore,and it's explantion is :The Thiru Kural in verse 399 emphasizes the perpetual attraction of learning for the learned. The verse suggests that those who have tasted the sweetness of knowledge not only gain personal satisfaction but also recognize the joy it brings to the world. Observing this dual benefit, they are inspired to continue their quest for learning.\n\nIn a broader sense, this kural underlines the importance of lifelong learning. It reveals that knowledge is not static, but rather a dynamic process that continually evolves and provides pleasure both to the individual and society. This pleasure comes from the understanding and insights that learning offers, which is why those who have experienced it continuously seek more.\n\nFurthermore, the verse also hints at the social responsibility of the learned. They see that their knowledge can bring joy and enlightenment to others in society, and this motivates them to learn more. It's a cycle of learning and sharing that benefits both the individual and the broader community.\n\nIn conclusion, this Thiru Kural verse inspires the pursuit of knowledge not as a mere personal endeavor, but as a tool for societal well-being, underlining the symbiotic relationship between personal satisfaction and communal progress..The kural verse:கேடில் விழுச்செல்வம் கல்வி யொருவற்குமாடல்ல மற்றை யவை. ,translates to :Learning is wealth none could destroy  Nothing else gives genuine joy,and it's explantion is :This verse asserts the importance and value of education or learning over any other forms of wealth. The poet Thiruvalluvar emphasizes that only learning or knowledge is the true, imperishable wealth that a person can acquire. This is because all other forms of wealth, such as money, property, or material possessions, are transient and can be lost, stolen, or diminished over time. They are subject to decay, destruction, or loss. \n\nHowever, knowledge or learning, once gained, cannot be taken away. It not only enriches the person who possesses it but also enables him/her to enrich others. It is a source of continual growth and development, and it is a wealth that increases by sharing. This wealth of knowledge also has the power to generate other forms of wealth and provide a person with a dignified and respected position in society. \n\nTherefore, Thiruvalluvar strongly suggests that one should strive for the acquisition of knowledge, as it is the only true and everlasting wealth. This is a universal truth applicable to all cultures and societies, and it underscores the timeless wisdom of Thiruvalluvar's Thirukkural..The kural verse:அரங்கின்றி வட்டாடி யற்றே நிரம்பியநூலின்றிக் கோட்டி கொளல். ,translates to :Like play of chess on squareless board  Vain is imperfect loreless word,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural highlights the importance of preparedness and in-depth knowledge while engaging in intellectual discussions or debates. It uses the analogy of a chess game played on a board without squares, which is impossible, to illustrate the futility of speaking in a scholarly assembly without adequate knowledge and understanding.\n\nIn the context of the verse, the assembly refers to a gathering of learned individuals who engage in intellectual discourse. Speaking or debating in such an assembly without sufficient knowledge is likened to playing chess without a marked board. Just as a chess game requires a board with clearly demarcated squares for meaningful play, an intellectual discussion requires well-grounded knowledge for meaningful participation.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that one should not rush into debates or discussions without being well-versed in the subject matter. It underscores the importance of thorough learning and understanding before engaging in scholarly discourse. Speaking without sufficient understanding may lead to embarrassment and discredit. Therefore, one should endeavor to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the subject before engaging in intellectual debates or discussions.\n\nThis verse is a timeless piece of wisdom that is applicable in various contexts, including academic, professional, and social settings. It encourages individuals to approach discussions and debates with humility, preparedness, and a deep understanding of the subject matter. It is a reminder that intellectual discourse is not merely about speaking, but about contributing meaningfully through informed and insightful inputs..The kural verse:கல்லாதான் சொற்கா முறுதல் முலையிரண்டும்இல்லாதாள் பெண்காமுற் றற்று. ,translates to :Unlearned man aspiring speech  Is breastless lady's love-approach,and it's explantion is :Kural 402 brings forth an interesting comparison to highlight the importance of wisdom and learning before seeking to speak in public or in scholarly assemblies. \n\nThe verse metaphorically compares an unlearned person's desire to speak in a learned assembly to a woman without breasts yearning to experience womanhood. Just as the woman lacks the physical attributes necessary for nourishing a child, thus making her longing for womanhood futile, similarly, an unlearned person lacks the intellectual nourishment required for meaningful discourse. Their desire to speak in a scholarly gathering is therefore just as ill-founded. The underlying wisdom of the verse lies in its emphasis on the importance of acquiring knowledge and understanding before venturing to express one's opinions in public.\n\nIn a broader cultural context, Thiruvalluvar, the author of Thiru Kural, underscores the value of education and wisdom in ancient Tamil society. His comparison also subtly hints at the defined roles and expectations of individuals in the society of his time.\n\nIn essence, this kural is a reminder that learning and understanding should precede the act of speaking in public, especially in scholarly or intellectual gatherings. It warns against the folly of speaking without knowledge, which not only exposes one's ignorance but also devalues the discourse..The kural verse:கல்லா தவரும் நனிநல்லர் கற்றார்முன்சொல்லா திருக்கப் பெறின். ,translates to :Ev'n unread men are good and wise  If before the wise, they hold their peace,and it's explantion is :Kural 403 emphasizes the virtue of humility and the power of silence, especially in the presence of the learned or the knowledgeable. The verse suggests that even those who are uneducated can be considered as excellent individuals if they have the wisdom to stay silent when they are in the company of those who are learned.\n\nThe underlying message of this verse is the importance of acknowledging one's limitations. By choosing to remain silent in the presence of the learned, an uneducated individual shows respect for knowledge and learning, and acknowledges their own lack of it. This act of humility and respect can make them just as admirable as those who are learned.\n\nMoreover, silence in this context is not a sign of ignorance, but of wisdom. It suggests an understanding that speaking without knowledge can lead to mistakes or misinformation. So, it's better to listen and learn from the knowledgeable than to speak without understanding.\n\nIn broader terms, this verse promotes the idea that one's worth is not solely determined by their educational status, but also by their behavior, attitude, and understanding of the world around them..The kural verse:கல்லாதான் ஒட்பம் கழியநன் றாயினும்கொள்ளார் அறிவுடை யார். ,translates to :The unread's wit though excellent  Is not valued by the savant,and it's explantion is :Kural 404 discusses the difference between acquired knowledge through education and innate wisdom. While innate wisdom or natural intelligence may be commendable, it does not hold the same value or recognition in the eyes of the learned individuals as compared to knowledge gained through formal education or self-learning. \n\nThe verse highlights the importance of structured learning and education, which not only imparts knowledge but also provides a framework to apply it effectively. It suggests that even when an uneducated person possesses good natural intelligence, it may not be considered as valuable or 'true knowledge' by those who have gained formal education. \n\nThis is because structured learning not only equips an individual with knowledge but also gives them the ability to analyze, reason, and apply that knowledge in various circumstances. Therefore, the verse emphasizes the criticality of education in shaping an individual's intellect and wisdom. \n\nThis does not undermine the value of natural intelligence, but rather underscores the importance of honing and enhancing it through formal education. The verse conveys the message that formal education and learning are essential to be recognized and respected in society, despite the natural intelligence one might possess. \n\nHowever, this Kural should not be interpreted as a depreciation of innate wisdom or intelligence, but a recognition that education gives a structure and depth to the raw intelligence, making it more acceptable and appreciable..The kural verse:கல்லா ஒருவன் தகைமை தலைப்பெய்துசொல்லாடச் சோர்வு படும். ,translates to :A man untaught when speech he vaunts  Sadly fails before savants,and it's explantion is :Kural 405 emphasizes the importance of knowledge and learning. It states that the self-esteem or arrogance of an unlearned person will vanish once he starts speaking in a gathering of educated individuals. \n\nThe verse metaphorically speaks about the superficial facade that an unlearned person might maintain. This facade of false pride or self-conceit can only be upheld until they start speaking or expressing their thoughts. Once they do, their lack of knowledge becomes evident to everyone around them, especially in a company of learned individuals. This leads to their self-conceit fading away.\n\nThe moral underpinning of this verse is to highlight the value of education and knowledge. It implies that one shouldn't be boastful about their abilities or status, especially when they lack proper knowledge or understanding. Being unlearned and maintaining a facade of knowledge can lead to embarrassment and reduction of one's respect in society. \n\nThis verse encourages individuals to pursue knowledge and wisdom, not just for societal recognition, but more importantly, for personal growth and self-improvement. It tells us that genuine knowledge and wisdom cannot be faked or substituted with mere pretense..The kural verse:உளரென்னும் மாத்திரையர் அல்லால் பயவாக்களரனையர் கல்லா தவர். ,translates to :People speak of untaught minds  \\\"They just exist like barren lands\\\",and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of education and knowledge. The verse compares uneducated individuals to barren land, suggesting that they are essentially unproductive and unfulfilling.\n\nThe 'land' metaphor is particularly poignant as it signifies potential. Just as fertile land can yield crops and sustain life, an educated mind can generate ideas, solutions, and contribute to societal progress. Conversely, barren land, despite its existence, remains unproductive, offering nothing of value. Similarly, an uneducated person, despite their physical existence, might not contribute significantly to society.\n\nThe verse does not degrade the uneducated but puts forth a strong argument for the importance of learning and knowledge. It suggests that mere existence is not enough; one must strive to be knowledgeable and productive to be of value to society. It serves as a reminder of the potential that lies within each individual, which can only be unearthed and utilized through education and learning. \n\nIn a broader moral context, the verse could also be interpreted as a call to self-improvement and growth. It could be seen as encouraging individuals to continuously seek knowledge, develop their skills, and strive to be valuable contributors to society, rather than remaining stagnant and unproductive..The kural verse:நுண்மாண் நுழைபுலம் இல்லான் எழில்நலம்மண்மாண் புனைபாவை யற்று. ,translates to :Like painted clay-doll is his show  Grand subtle lore who fails to know,and it's explantion is :The Kural 407 emphasizes the importance of knowledge and wisdom over superficial beauty or physical attractiveness. It metaphorically compares a person who is physically attractive but devoid of wisdom to a beautifully painted earthen doll. \n\nJust as an earthen doll might seem appealing with its painted surface, a person might seem attractive with their physical attributes. However, the doll is still made of clay and can crumble easily, and its beauty is superficial and temporary. Similarly, a person without wisdom or acquired knowledge from profound and insightful works is superficial. They may be pleasing to the eye, but without the stability and depth that wisdom brings, their attractiveness is fleeting and lacks substance.\n\nHence, the verse stresses the importance of nurturing the mind and gaining wisdom, suggesting that true beauty lies not in one's physical appearance but in their knowledge and wisdom. This is a common theme in Thiru Kural, which often prioritizes inner virtues over outer appearances..The kural verse:நல்லார்கண் பட்ட வறுமையின் இன்னாதேகல்லார்கண் பட் ட திரு. ,translates to :Wealth in the hand of fools is worse  Than a learned man's empty purse,and it's explantion is :The Thiru Kural verse 408 emphasizes the importance of knowledge over wealth, particularly underlining how wealth without wisdom can lead to sorrow. The verse suggests that the hardship or poverty experienced by those who are learned and wise is less distressing than the riches possessed by those who lack wisdom or knowledge.\n\nThe verse implies a deeper moral message: wealth in the hands of the uneducated or unwise can lead to misuse, misunderstanding, and ultimately more suffering because they lack the understanding or wisdom to manage it effectively. On the other hand, those who are knowledgeable, even when they face poverty, are less likely to suffer because they possess the wisdom to navigate their circumstances.\n\nIn this context, the verse promotes the value of wisdom and knowledge over material wealth, suggesting that the latter without the former can ultimately lead to greater distress. It also underlines the enduring value of education and understanding in leading a fulfilling and meaningful life, regardless of one's material circumstances..The kural verse:மேற்பிறந்தா ராயினும் கல்லாதார் கீழ்ப்பிறந்தும்கற்றார் அனைத்திலர் பாடு. ,translates to :Lower are fools of higher birth  Than low-born men of learning's worth,and it's explantion is :Kural 409 emphasizes the value of knowledge over birth status or caste. It suggests that the dignity and worth of a person is not determined by the caste or class they are born into, but by their learning and wisdom. Even if a person is born in a high caste, if they lack knowledge, they are considered inferior to a learned person who may have been born into a lower caste. This verse highlights the transformative power of education and knowledge, which transcends social hierarchies and distinctions.\n\nThe Tamil explanations echo the same sentiment, stating that the prestige of being a learned individual surpasses any differentiation based on birth or caste. Regardless of one's origin, the lack of education renders them less worthy compared to those who have sought knowledge. This verse thus propounds the idea that true nobility and honor stem from wisdom and learning, not from one's birth or social status..The kural verse:விலங்கொடு மக்கள் அனையர் இலங்குநூல்கற்றாரோடு ஏனை யவர். ,translates to :Like beasts before men, dunces are  Before scholars of shining lore,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse emphasizes the importance of learning and knowledge. It draws a comparison stating that the difference between humans and animals is similar to the difference between those who have studied and understood profound works of knowledge and those who haven't. \n\nThe term 'beasts' here is used to underline the lack of knowledge, understanding, and wisdom that animals inherently possess. It implies that those who do not strive for knowledge are no different than animals, as they also live their lives based on instinct and immediate needs. \n\nOn the other hand, those who are learned, those who have delved into the depths of profound knowledge, possess a richer understanding of life, the world, and beyond. They are able to make thoughtful decisions, contribute positively to society, and lead a more purposeful life. \n\nIn essence, the verse extols the value of knowledge and learning and highlights the stark contrast in the quality of life between the learned and the unlearned, similar to the difference between humans and animals..The kural verse:செல்வத்துட் செல்வஞ் செவிச்செல்வம் அச்செல்வம்செல்வத்து ளெல்லாந் தலை. ,translates to :Wealth of wealths is listening's wealth  It is the best of wealths on earth,and it's explantion is :Kural 411 speaks about the importance and superiority of knowledge over all other forms of wealth. The wealth referred to here is not materialistic, but it is the knowledge gained through listening and learning.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that the wealth gained through the 'ear,' which symbolizes the acquisition of knowledge and wisdom by listening, is the greatest of all wealth. This form of wealth is unique, as it can never be stolen, cannot be depleted by use, and indeed, it grows by sharing.\n\nThe 'wealth of the ear' is considered superior because unlike material wealth, it is not transient, it does not lead to conflicts, and it enhances the dignity and respect of the individual. Furthermore, it helps the individual make wise decisions, live a life of righteousness, and contribute positively to society.\n\nThus, the verse extolls the virtues of knowledge and wisdom, gained through active listening and learning, and places them above all other forms of wealth. This timeless wisdom is as relevant today as it was when Thiruvalluvar penned it, reminding us to continually seek knowledge and wisdom in our lives..The kural verse:செவுக்குண வில்லாத போழ்து சிறிதுவயிற்றுக்கும் ஈயப் படும். ,translates to :Some food for the stomach is brought  When the ear gets no food for thought,and it's explantion is :Kural 412 conveys the importance of intellectual nourishment over physical sustenance. It implies that when the ears do not receive their \"food\", which is knowledge and wisdom gained through hearing, one should at the very least provide a bit of sustenance to the stomach, or the physical body. \n\nIn essence, the Kural emphasizes the value of wisdom and learning over mere physical needs. The ear is used as a metaphor for learning and absorbing knowledge, while the stomach represents the physical body's necessity for food. \n\nThe Kural suggests that if one cannot feed their intellect, due to lack of opportunities or resources, they should at least ensure their physical survival by eating. However, the underlying message is an encouragement to prioritize intellectual and spiritual growth over mere physical existence.\n\nThis verse is a profound commentary on the importance of knowledge and wisdom in human life, and the need to strive for intellectual nourishment, even when dealing with physical hunger. It teaches us that while physical nourishment is necessary for survival, intellectual nourishment is what truly enriches life..The kural verse:செவியுணவிற் கேள்வி யுடையார் அவியுணவின்ஆன்றாரோ டொப்பர் நிலத்து. ,translates to :Whose ears get lots of wisdom-food  Equal gods on oblations fed,and it's explantion is :Kural 413 emphasizes the importance of learning and seeking knowledge. It describes learning as 'the food of the ear', a metaphor illustrating how knowledge is absorbed through listening and understanding, just as food is consumed for physical nourishment.\n\nThe verse states that those who indulge in this 'food of the ear', or in other words, those who are eager to learn and gain wisdom, are equivalent to the gods who enjoy the offerings of sacrifices. This comparison implies that just as Gods are revered and respected for their divinity, individuals who are dedicated to learning and gaining wisdom are also worthy of high regard and respect. \n\nIn the cultural context of ancient India, sacrifices were considered as offerings or food for the gods. Similarly, the pursuit of knowledge nourishes the intellect and the soul, elevating a person to a god-like status. The moral message here is to encourage the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom, suggesting that it is a divine act that leads to high esteem, just like the gods who are nourished by the sacrificial offerings.\n\nThis verse, therefore, underscores the importance of education and the pursuit of knowledge, highlighting its power to elevate a person's status and dignity, likening them to divine beings..The kural verse:கற்றில னாயினுங் கேட்க அஃதொருவற்குஒற்கத்தின் ஊற்றாந் துணை. ,translates to :Though not learned, hear and heed  That serves a staff and stay in need,and it's explantion is :Kural 414 emphasizes the importance of learning and gaining knowledge, even if it's not through formal education. It suggests that one does not necessarily need to be formally educated to be wise or knowledgeable. If a person, despite being uneducated, listens and learns from those who are learned, that knowledge can serve as a support in times of adversity, just like a staff helps a person who stumbles.\n\nThe metaphor of the staff is significant here. A staff provides support and stability to those who need it, helping them navigate difficult terrain. Similarly, the knowledge gained from listening to the learned acts as a guiding force in life, helping an individual navigate through challenging times and situations.\n\nThe verse also underscores the value of humility and openness to learning. It suggests that regardless of one's educational status, one should always be open to learning from others. This reflects a key aspect of Tamil culture and philosophy that values wisdom and knowledge above formal education.\n\nIn essence, this Kural speaks to the power of lifelong learning and the importance of being receptive to knowledge from all sources. It teaches us that wisdom is not restricted to the educated alone and that the willingness to listen and learn can provide invaluable support in life's journey..The kural verse:இழுக்கல் உடையுழி ஊற்றுக்கோல் அற்றேஒழுக்க முடையார்வாய்ச் சொல். ,translates to :Virtuous men's wisdom is found  A strong staff on slippery ground,and it's explantion is :Kural 415 is a beautiful verse that draws a metaphor between the words of the virtuous and a staff used in a slippery terrain. In life, we often encounter situations that are challenging, confusing, and filled with uncertainties - much like trying to navigate a slippery path. It's easy to lose our footing and fall, both literally and metaphorically.\n\nIn such times, the words of those who are virtuous and righteous act as a staff or a support system. Just as a staff helps to maintain balance and gives support when walking on slippery ground, the wise words of the virtuous guide us, providing stability and direction in our life's journey. They help us make the right choices, navigate through difficulties, and stay grounded in our values and principles.\n\nThis verse emphasizes the importance of good counsel and the role of virtuous individuals in society. It encourages us to seek and heed advice from those who lead lives of integrity and righteousness. Their wisdom and ethical guidance can be our support system in navigating the slippery slopes of life..The kural verse:எனைத்தானும் நல்லவை கேட்க அனைத்தானும்ஆன்ற பெருமை தரும். ,translates to :Lend ear to good words however few  That much will highly exalt you,and it's explantion is :Verse 416 of the Thiru Kural emphasizes the significance and the transformative power of gaining knowledge, particularly good instructions or teachings. It underscores that no matter how little one learns, as long as it is beneficial and virtuous, it has the potential to confer immense dignity and respect upon the individual.\n\nThe verse encourages the act of learning and advises us to seek out beneficial knowledge regardless of the quantity. It suggests that even a small measure of good instruction can have profound effects on an individual's character and standing in society. It also implies that knowledge is not measured merely in terms of quantity, but more importantly, in terms of quality and usefulness.\n\nThe verse, therefore, serves as a reminder of the value and potency of knowledge, and it exhorts us to persist in our pursuit of learning, assuring us that even a little of it can considerably enhance our self-worth and stature. \n\nIn broader terms, this can also be seen as a call to societies to invest in education and promote the spread of useful and moral knowledge as a means to uplift individuals and communities..The kural verse:பிழைத்துணர்ந்தும் பேதைமை சொல்லா ரிழைத்துணர்ந்தீண்டிய கேள்வி யவர். ,translates to :Who listen well and learn sharply  Not ev'n by slip speak foolishly,and it's explantion is :Kural 417 emphasizes the wisdom of those who have deeply studied and attentively listened to teachings and instructions throughout their life. Such individuals, even when they have not fully grasped or have misunderstood a certain matter, will not speak thoughtlessly or foolishly. This Kural reflects the wisdom of restraint and careful thought before speaking, particularly when one is not entirely certain about a subject.\n\nThe verse speaks to the virtue of humility in acknowledging what we do not know and the importance of thoughtful communication. It highlights the idea that true wisdom lies not just in acquiring knowledge but also in knowing its limits. It also highlights the fact that those who are truly knowledgeable always strive to avoid inaccuracies or misrepresentations, even when they are not completely certain, rather than risk speaking foolishly or spreading misinformation.\n\nIn essence, this Kural encourages diligent learning, thoughtful understanding, careful listening, and mindful speaking, even when faced with uncertainty or incomplete understanding..The kural verse:கேட்பினுங் கேளாத் தகையவே கேள்வியால்தோட்கப் படாத செவி. ,translates to :That ear though hearing is dulled  Which is not by wisdom drilled,and it's explantion is :The Thiru Kural verse 418 emphasizes the importance of being receptive to knowledge and instruction. It metaphorically refers to an ear that is not receptive to wisdom as an unbored or un-pierced ear. \n\nIn traditional Tamil culture, ear-piercing is a significant rite of passage that signifies the readiness of a person to listen and learn from the wisdom of elders and society. Thus, in this context, an 'un-pierced' ear symbolizes a mind that is not open to learning or instruction.\n\nThe verse implies that even though the physical ear has the ability to hear sounds, it is rendered useless, akin to being deaf, if it chooses not to listen or absorb valuable knowledge or advice. It underscores the significance of active listening and receptiveness in personal growth and wisdom acquisition. \n\nSo, the verse advises us to be open and receptive to knowledge, wisdom and instruction, for without such an attitude, our ability to hear becomes as good as being deaf..The kural verse:நுணங்கிய கேள்விய ரல்லார் வணங்கியவாயின ராதல் அரிது. ,translates to :A modest mouth is hard for those  Who care little to counsels wise,and it's explantion is :This Kural (verse 419) emphasizes the importance of proper instruction and wisdom in shaping one's behavior and speech. In essence, it states that it is unlikely to find profound humility and respectful speech in those who have not received valuable and discerning instruction.\n\nThe verse underscores that wisdom is not merely the acquisition of knowledge, but also the manner in which one communicates and interacts with others. It suggests that without the right guidance and knowledge, one might struggle to exhibit modesty in their speech and demeanor. This reflects the deep link between wisdom and humility in Tamil culture, indicating that true wisdom always manifests as respectfulness and modesty.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse advocates for the value of education and learning, not just for practical or material benefits, but also for personal and moral development. It subtly urges the pursuit of wisdom and learning as a means to cultivate respectful speech and humble behavior..The kural verse:செவியிற் சுவையுணரா வாயுணர்வின் மாக்கள்அவியினும் வாழினும் என்? ,translates to :Who taste by mouth and not by ear  What if they fare ill or well here?,and it's explantion is :The Kural 420 questions the purpose of existence for those who solely seek physical gratification and neglect intellectual or spiritual engagement. The taste \"judged by the mouth\" here symbolizes the physical indulgences such as food and sensual pleasures. The taste \"judged by the ear,\" on the other hand, signifies the intellectual or spiritual experiences, such as learning, wisdom, and moral understanding, which are often received and processed through listening.\n\nThe verse is a critique of those who live just for sensual gratification, ignoring the intellectual and spiritual aspects of life. They are so engrossed in their physical senses that they fail to appreciate the richness of knowledge and wisdom, which often comes from listening and understanding.\n\nThe rhetorical question, \"What does it matter whether those men live or die,\" signifies that such a life, devoid of intellectual and moral pursuit, is as good as death. This verse, therefore, emphasizes the importance of balance in life and encourages individuals to value moral and intellectual development alongside physical well-being..The kural verse:அறிவற்றங் காக்குங் கருவி செறுவார்க்கும்உள்ளழிக்க லாகா அரண். ,translates to :Wisdom's weapon wards off all woes  It is a fort defying foes,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural emphasizes the importance and power of wisdom. It is likened to a weapon that safeguards from destruction and a fortress that is impervious to enemies. \n\nThe first half of the Kural states that wisdom acts as a weapon that helps prevent destruction. This means that knowledge and understanding can help individuals navigate through challenges and adversities, preventing them from succumbing to potentially destructive situations. \n\nThe second part of the verse compares wisdom to a fortress that cannot be destroyed by enemies. This suggests that wisdom, once acquired, is an internal resource that cannot be taken away or diminished by others. It serves as a protective barrier against negative influences, wrong decisions, and harmful actions.\n\nOverall, this verse underscores the enduring and protective value of wisdom. It encourages the pursuit of knowledge and understanding, as these qualities offer resilience in the face of adversity and serve as a steadfast defense against the potential harms of ignorance..The kural verse:சென்ற இடத்தால் செலவிடா தீதொரீஇநன்றின்பால் உய்ப்ப தறிவு. ,translates to :Wisdom checks the straying senses  Expels evils, impels goodness,and it's explantion is :The verse (Kural 422) from Thiru Kural emphasizes wisdom as the ability to control and guide one's mind in a righteous direction. Thiruvalluvar, the poet, suggests that wisdom is not just about intellectual knowledge but also about the ability to make moral judgements and ethical choices.\n\nThe verse advises that one should not let the mind wander aimlessly or be drawn towards evil or destructive paths. Instead, it should be consciously directed towards goodness and righteousness. This implies exercising self-control, resisting temptations, and making decisions that are ethically sound and beneficial not just to oneself but also to others.\n\nThe verse highlights the importance of introspection and self-discipline. It encourages us to be mindful of our thoughts and actions, and to consciously choose paths that lead to personal growth, well-being, and a positive impact on society. Such discernment in choosing 'right' over 'wrong' is presented as the hallmark of true wisdom. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse also emphasizes the power and freedom each individual has over their own mind. It asserts that every person has the capability to shape their thoughts and actions, and thus their character and destiny, through conscious decision-making. This understanding of wisdom is deeply empowering as it places the responsibility and potential for self-improvement and societal betterment firmly in the hands of each individual..The kural verse:எப்பொருள் யார்யார்வாய்க் கேட்பினும் அப்பொருள்மெய்ப்பொருள் காண்ப தறிவு. ,translates to :To grasp the Truth from everywhere  From everyone is wisdom fair,and it's explantion is :The verse 423 of Thiru Kural essentially emphasizes the value of discernment, which is the ability to judge well. The verse suggests that true wisdom lies not in blindly accepting or believing whatever is said by whoever said it, but in discerning the truth in it.\n\nIn other words, regardless of the source or the person conveying a piece of information, one should not just accept it at face value. Instead, the information should be scrutinized, analyzed, and understood well to identify its real truth or essence. This process of seeking the ultimate truth in every piece of information is considered the real mark of wisdom according to this verse.\n\nThis verse underlines a universal truth that applies to every field, be it philosophy, science, or daily life. It encourages critical thinking, questioning, and deep understanding, which are all essential aspects of wisdom. \n\nIn a broader sense, it also encourages us to not judge a message by its messenger but to focus instead on the content and its validity. The wisdom here is to separate the wheat from the chaff, the truth from the falsehood, regardless of where or who it comes from. This is an essential skill to navigate the world filled with a myriad of information and perspectives..The kural verse:எண்பொருள வாகச் செலச்சொல்லித் தான்பிறர்வாய்நுண்பொருள் காண்ப தறிவு. ,translates to :Speaking out thoughts in clear trends  Wisdom subtle sense comprehends,and it's explantion is :Kural 424 emphasizes the importance of clear communication and deep understanding in the realm of wisdom. It suggests that true wisdom lies not only in being able to express complex thoughts and ideas in a way that is easily comprehensible to others, but also in having the ability to discern and understand the subtle, often hidden meanings in what others say.\n\nThe verse recognizes that communication is a two-way process, involving both speaking and listening. Wisdom, according to this verse, requires one to be adept at both. When speaking, one should do so in a way that is easily understood, ensuring that the ideas or thoughts being conveyed are easy to grasp for the listener. This involves simplifying complex ideas without losing their essence and expressing them in a way that resonates with the listener.\n\nOn the other hand, when listening, one should have the ability to pick up on the nuances and subtleties in the speech of others. Even if the speaker's thoughts are deeply layered or complex, a wise person should be able to discern and understand these hidden thoughts. This requires keen attention, empathy, and a deep understanding of the speaker's context and perspective.\n\nIn essence, this verse suggests that wisdom involves both effective communication and deep understanding, signifying the importance of these skills in leading a wise and enlightened life..The kural verse:உலகம் தழீஇய தொட்பம் மலர்தலும்கூம்பலும் இல்ல தறிவு. ,translates to :The wise-world the wise befriend  They bloom nor gloom, equal in mind,and it's explantion is :The Kural 425 emphasizes the importance of wisdom in establishing and maintaining relationships, particularly with influential people. The verse conveys that it's not enough to just form connections with the great or influential people, the real wisdom lies in maintaining the relationship consistently without fluctuating like a blooming and wilting lotus.\n\nIn the cultural context, the lotus is often observed to bloom with the rising sun and close at sunset, symbolizing inconsistency or fickleness. This verse advises against such inconsistency in relationships, especially with influential people. It suggests that true wisdom is to remain steady and consistent in our bonds, irrespective of circumstances. It implies that one should not overly rejoice in the beginning of a friendship or excessively lament at the sight of any hurdle, instead, one should handle both joy and sorrow equitably, displaying maturity and wisdom.\n\nTherefore, the verse underlines the importance of steadiness and consistency in relationships, which is a sign of true wisdom. The verse also acknowledges the significance of relationships with influential people in society and encourages nurturing these relationships with wisdom and consistency..The kural verse:எவ்வ துறைவது உலகம் உலகத்தோடுஅவ்வ துறைவ தறிவு. ,translates to :As moves the world so move the wise  In tune with changing times and ways,and it's explantion is :Kural 426 emphasizes the importance of adaptability and conformity to societal norms in order to live a harmonious life. It suggests that wisdom lies in understanding how the world operates and adapting oneself to align with these ways. This does not mean to blindly follow the crowd, but to be aware of the prevailing norms and customs, learning from them, and using that knowledge to navigate through life.\n\nThe verse encourages us to observe and learn from the 'successful' or 'wise' individuals in our society. How they act and react, how they handle situations, how they balance their personal and professional lives, can all be lessons for us to imbibe. It promotes the idea that wisdom is not just about intellectual knowledge, but also about practical understanding and adaptability.\n\nHowever, this should not be mistaken for losing one's individuality or blindly following societal norms even when they are wrong. The verse encourages learning from the world to live in harmony with it, not to surrender one's ethical and moral standards. It's about living wisely within the societal framework while maintaining one's integrity. \n\nIn conclusion, this verse speaks about the wisdom in understanding the world's ways, learning from it, and incorporating the beneficial aspects into one's life for a harmonious coexistence..The kural verse:அறிவுடையார் ஆவ தறிவார் அறிவிலார்அஃதறி கல்லா தவர். ,translates to :The wise foresee what is to come  The unwise lack in that wisdom,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse emphasizes the importance of foresight and wisdom. The truly wise, according to Valluvar, are those who can anticipate the consequences of an event or action. They have the ability to analyze situations, predict outcomes, and make prudent decisions based on their understanding. This foresight is a result of their wisdom, experience, and discernment.\n\nOn the contrary, those who lack such wisdom or foresight are considered unwise. They are unable to foresee the outcomes of their actions or events around them. This lack of foresight can lead to unpreparedness, poor decision-making, and unfavorable consequences. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse underscores the importance of strategic thinking and planning in all aspects of life, whether personal, professional, or societal. It encourages us to cultivate wisdom and foresight to navigate the complexities of life effectively and efficiently..The kural verse:அஞ்சுவ தஞ்சாமை பேதைமை அஞ்சுவதுஅஞ்சல் அறிவார் தொழில். ,translates to :Fear the frightful and act wisely  Not to fear the frightful's folly,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 428, emphasizes the importance of fear in the right context. It suggests that it is unwise not to fear what is truly fearful. The absence of fear in the face of imminent danger or negative consequences reflects a lack of understanding or ignorance. This could be applicable to various situations in life, for instance, not fearing the consequences of unethical actions, not worrying about health issues, or being reckless in financial matters.\n\nOn the other hand, the verse also points out that it is the mark of a wise person to fear what should be feared. This fear is not about being constantly anxious or paranoid, but rather about being aware and cautious. It's about understanding the potential negative outcome of an action and acting responsibly to avoid it. This could mean abiding by ethical norms to avoid negative societal consequences, taking care of one's health to avoid diseases, or managing finances wisely to prevent financial crises.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, through this Kural, teaches us the importance of caution and due diligence in all aspects of life. It encourages us to be mindful of our actions and their potential outcomes, promoting wisdom and responsible behavior..The kural verse:எதிரதாக் காக்கும் அறிவினார்க் கில்லைஅதிர வருவதோர் நோய். ,translates to :No frightful evil shocks the wise  Who guard themselves against surprise,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of foresight and preparedness. It suggests that those who possess the wisdom to foresee potential difficulties and take necessary measures to prevent them, will not face any calamity that will cause them fear or distress.\n\nThis wisdom, as per Thirukural, is not just limited to intellectual knowledge but also includes the ability to apply that knowledge in a practical sense. It's about understanding the consequences of actions and being prepared for them. \n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse encourages us to be proactive rather than reactive, to anticipate problems and deal with them before they escalate into major issues. It teaches us that preparedness and anticipation are significant aspects of wisdom and those who practice this are unlikely to be overwhelmed by sudden adversities.\n\nFor instance, just like a well-prepared farmer who sows his seeds before the onset of rain to reap a good harvest, a wise person anticipates and prepares for potential problems, thereby averting major catastrophes. \n\nIn conclusion, this Thiru Kural verse advocates for prudence, foresight, and timely action as effective shields against impending difficulties..The kural verse:அறிவுடையார் எல்லா முடையார் அறிவிலார்என்னுடைய ரேனும் இலர். ,translates to :Who have wisdom they are all full  Whatev'r they own, misfits are nil,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural essentially underscores the supreme value of wisdom and knowledge. When Thiruvalluvar says that those who have wisdom have everything, he implies that wisdom is the highest form of wealth, because it can guide a person in making the right decisions, leading a virtuous life, and attaining peace and happiness. Wisdom can also protect a person from many miseries and difficulties in life.\n\nOn the other hand, those who lack wisdom, regardless of the worldly possessions they might have, are considered to have nothing. This is because material wealth is transient and can often lead to more problems than solutions if not managed wisely. Without wisdom, one may not know how to utilize their wealth for the betterment of themselves and others, and may be led astray by greed, arrogance, and other negative emotions.\n\nIn essence, this Kural emphasizes that wisdom is the most valuable possession one can have, as it is the key to leading a fulfilling, meaningful, and virtuous life. Regardless of the material wealth one has, without wisdom, one's life can be empty and devoid of true joy and fulfillment..The kural verse:செருக்குஞ் சினமும் சிறுமையும் இல்லார்பெருக்கம் பெருமித நீர்த்து. ,translates to :Plenty is their prosperity  Who're free from wrath pride lust petty,and it's explantion is :Kural 431 emphasizes the importance of humility, calmness, and self-control for those in positions of authority, specifically kings. The verse declares that the true greatness of a ruler is best reflected not by their wealth or power, but by their absence of pride, anger, and lust.\n\nPride is seen as a barrier to wisdom and understanding, as it can blind an individual to their own faults and limitations. A proud ruler might overlook the needs and perspectives of his subjects, leading to poor governance.\n\nAnger, similarly, is a destructive emotion that can cloud judgement and lead to rash decisions. A ruler who is quick to anger can foster fear and resentment among his subjects, undermining his own authority.\n\nLust, in this context, can be interpreted as an excessive desire for power, wealth, or physical pleasure. Such desires can distract a ruler from his duties and potentially lead him to act unjustly or irresponsibly.\n\nTherefore, a ruler who is free from these negative traits can lead with wisdom, fairness, and integrity. This, according to Thirukkural, is the true measure of a ruler's greatness. Such a ruler will enjoy sustainable growth and prosperity, as their leadership would be based on moral strength and balanced judgment..The kural verse:இவறலும் மாண்பிறந்த மானமும் மாணாஉவகையும் ஏதம் இறைக்கு. ,translates to :Mean pride, low pleasure, avarice  These add blemishes to a prince,and it's explantion is :The Thiru Kural 432 discusses three major flaws that can undermine the dignity and effectiveness of a ruler or leader. \n\n1. Avarice: This refers to an excessive or insatiable desire for wealth or gain. A leader is expected to be fair and just in his rule, and excessive greed can lead to corruption, injustice, and unfair practices which ultimately harm the people he is supposed to serve.\n\n2. Undignified Pride: This refers to an inflated sense of personal status or accomplishments. A leader is supposed to be humble and understanding, treating everyone with respect and dignity. An undue sense of pride can lead to arrogance, causing the leader to disregard the opinions and needs of others, leading to ineffective governance.\n\n3. Low Pleasures: The term refers to indulging in inappropriate or unethical activities for personal pleasure. A leader is expected to uphold the highest standards of ethics and morality. Engaging in lowly pleasures can tarnish his image and credibility, affecting his ability to lead effectively.\n\nTherefore, the verse advises leaders to avoid these three flaws, as they can damage their reputation, effectiveness, and overall leadership. It encourages leaders to maintain a fair and humble attitude, prioritize the well-being of their people, and uphold high moral standards..The kural verse:தினைத்துணையாங் குற்றம் வரினும் பனைத்துணையாக்கொள்வர் பழிநாணு வார். ,translates to :Though millet-small their faults might seem  Men fearing disgrace, Palm-tall deem,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse speaks about the consciousness and guilt that virtuous people experience even when they commit the smallest mistake. The comparison here is between a millet seed and a palmyra tree, which represent small and big respectively in Tamil culture. This metaphor is used to emphasize how those who are righteous perceive their mistakes.\n\nThe verse signifies that those who have a high moral standard and fear wrongdoing, even if they commit a minor fault as small as a millet seed, they consider it as significant as a palmyra tree. They are not dismissive of their errors, no matter how small they may be. Instead, they acknowledge, learn, and strive not to repeat them.\n\nTherefore, this verse teaches us the importance of self-awareness, self-correction, and the courage to admit one's faults. It encourages us to hold ourselves accountable for our actions, regardless of the size of our mistakes, demonstrating an essential aspect of character and morality..The kural verse:குற்றமே காக்க பொருளாகக் குற்றமேஅற்றந் த்ரூஉம் பகை. ,translates to :Watch like treasure freedom from fault  Our fatal foe is that default,and it's explantion is :Kural 434 emphasizes the importance of guarding oneself against moral failings or faults. These \"faults\" referred to in the verse can be anything from dishonesty, greed, arrogance, or any negative traits that can lead to one's downfall. \n\nIn the context of this verse, these faults are portrayed as a deadly enemy, causing destruction and harm. Just as one would guard against a physical enemy to protect oneself, the verse suggests that one should also guard against these moral faults with equal, if not more, vigilance.\n\nThe verse further implies that these faults not only hurt the individual who harbors them but also potentially harm others around them. Therefore, it becomes a matter of great consequence to guard against these faults. \n\nIn a broader sense, the Kural emphasizes the importance of self-awareness, self-restraint, and moral uprightness. It asks individuals to continually check and rectify their faults, as doing so not only leads to personal growth but also contributes to societal well-being. \n\nThus, the verse serves as a reminder of the potential harm of unchecked faults and the importance of self-improvement and ethical living. It advises us to make guarding against these faults a priority, as they are the real enemies that can lead to our downfall..The kural verse:வருமுன்னர்க் காவாதான் வாழ்க்கை எரிமுன்னர்வைத்தூறு போலக் கெடும். ,translates to :Who fails to guard himself from flaw  Loses his life like flame-lit straw,and it's explantion is :Kural 435 emphasizes the importance of proactive prevention of faults or errors in one's life or governance. The verse uses a powerful metaphor, comparing a life or rule that does not guard against potential faults to a straw that is placed before fire. Just as the straw is bound to be consumed by the fire, a life or rule that does not take precautions against potential faults is bound to perish or fail.\n\nIn simple terms, this verse teaches us the principle of being vigilant and proactive. It encourages us to anticipate problems, foresee potential errors, and take steps to prevent them from happening. This principle applies to all aspects of life, including personal conduct, professional endeavors, or governance.\n\nThe Tamil explanations (mk, mv, sp) further elaborate on this concept, emphasizing the inevitable downfall that comes from lack of foresight and prevention. They warn that just like a straw in front of fire is destined to be consumed, a life or rule that is not guarded against potential faults will certainly face destruction. \n\nIn essence, this verse is a timeless reminder of the importance of proactive prevention and the disastrous consequences of its absence. It serves as a call to remain vigilant, anticipate potential problems, and take preventive measures to safeguard our lives and endeavors from potential faults..The kural verse:தன்குற்றம் நீக்கிப் பிறர்குற்றங் காண்கிற்பின்என்குற்ற மாகும் இறைக்கு? ,translates to :What fault can be the king's who cures  First his faults, then scans others,and it's explantion is :Kural 436 emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and self-improvement for a leader or a king. The verse declares that a ruler who first identifies and rectifies his own flaws, and then turns his attention towards the faults of others, is free from any fault himself.\n\nThis verse underlines the principle that before criticizing or pointing out the faults in others, one should introspect and correct one's own shortcomings. This concept is particularly crucial for those in leadership roles, such as kings or rulers, as their actions and behaviors significantly influence their subjects. \n\nBy eliminating his own faults, the king sets a positive example for his subjects and gains the moral authority to correct the faults of others. If a leader can accomplish this, he is seen as faultless, and his leadership is more likely to be respected and followed. \n\nThis Kural, therefore, emphasises the importance of personal growth, self-improvement, and moral leadership. It insists that a leader should be a role model, embodying the values and standards that they wish to instill in their subjects..The kural verse:செயற்பால செய்யா திவறியான் செல்வம்உயற்பால தன்றிக் கெடும். ,translates to :That miser's wealth shall waste and end  Who would not for a good cause spend,and it's explantion is :This verse of the Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of utilizing wealth for rightful purposes. It suggests that the wealth accumulated by an individual who does not use it for the beneficial activities or purposes it is meant for, will eventually deplete and will not continue to exist or grow.\n\nThe verse addresses the concept of avarice or extreme greed for wealth. It warns against hoarding wealth and not using it for noble deeds or charitable actions that might benefit society. The wealth of such a person, Thiru Kural suggests, is doomed to waste away.\n\nIn essence, it promotes the idea that wealth is not meant to be merely accumulated, but to be used for the betterment of society, to aid those in need, and for the general promotion of goodness and welfare. Failure to do so will inevitably lead to the loss of the wealth itself. \n\nThis is not just a moral teaching but also an astute observation of the societal systems and economies. Money that is hoarded and not circulated or invested tends to lose its value over time. Therefore, both morally and economically, the verse suggests that wealth should be utilized responsibly and for the right purposes..The kural verse:பற்றுள்ளம் என்னும் இவறன்மை எற்றுள்ளும்எண்ணப் படுவதொன் றன்று. ,translates to :The gripping greed of miser's heart  Is more than fault the worst apart,and it's explantion is :Kural 438 discusses the severity of uncontrolled greed or avarice, particularly when it comes to wealth and material possessions. The verse suggests that avarice is not just another fault or flaw in a person's character. Instead, it is considered to be a singular, major fault that stands out among other faults.\n\nThe reasoning behind this is that unchecked greed can lead to numerous detrimental consequences. It can cause an individual to act selfishly, deny help to others who are in need, and even resort to dishonest means to acquire wealth. Moreover, the person with uncontrollable greed may never find true happiness or contentment, as their desire for more never ceases.\n\nIn the cultural context of the Thiru Kural, which promotes values such as generosity, righteousness, and compassion, avarice is seen as a significant moral failing. It goes against the ideals of sharing and caring for others, and the belief in living a balanced and content life with whatever one has.\n\nThis verse, thus, serves as a strong warning against greed and underscores the importance of developing virtues like contentment and generosity..The kural verse:வியவற்க எஞ்ஞான்றும் தன்னை நயவற்கநன்றி பயவா வினை. ,translates to :Never boast yourself in any mood  Nor do a deed that does no good,and it's explantion is :Kural 439 emphasizes the importance of humility and productive action. It advises individuals against self-praise or self-adulation at any point in time, irrespective of their personal achievements or status. Self-praise is seen as an act of arrogance that can lead to a false sense of superiority and prevent personal growth and development.\n\nFurthermore, the Kural advises against engaging in actions that do not contribute to the good or welfare of oneself or society at large. It encourages individuals to strive for actions that are beneficial, productive, and morally right, rather than wasting time and effort on useless or harmful activities.\n\nIn essence, this verse encourages humility, productivity, and responsible action as essential virtues for personal and societal well-being. The guidance provided in this Kural is timeless and universally applicable, emphasizing the need for self-awareness, modesty, and a strong ethical foundation in all aspects of life..The kural verse:காதல காதல் அறியாமை உய்க்கிற்பின்ஏதில ஏதிலார் நூல். ,translates to :All designs of the foes shall fail  If one his wishes guards in veil,and it's explantion is :Kural 440 discusses the importance of discretion and secrecy in leadership, specifically in the context of a king.\n\nThe verse suggests that if a king is able to secure and enjoy his desires without revealing them to his enemies, then the plans or strategies of his adversaries will prove to be futile. In other words, maintaining privacy and secrecy about one's plans and desires can protect a leader from potential threats and conspiracies.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this verse emphasizes the value of discretion and the art of maintaining confidentiality in leadership. It suggests that revealing too much can make one vulnerable to attacks or exploitation, while maintaining secrecy can keep one safe and maintain stability. \n\nThis principle can apply not only to kings or political leaders but also to anyone in a position of power or authority. The wisdom contained in this verse is applicable even today in various fields such as business, politics, and even personal life..The kural verse:அறனறிந்து மூத்த அறிவுடையார் கேண்மைதிறனறிந்து தேர்ந்து கொளல். ,translates to :Weigh their worth and friendship gain  Of men of virtue and mature brain,and it's explantion is :Kural 441 emphasizes the importance for a king - or any leader - to seek and foster relationships with people of virtue and wisdom. The verse advises that the ruler should understand the inestimable value of friendship with those who are principled and have mature knowledge, and make efforts to secure such relationships.\n\nThe term 'virtue' here refers to an understanding and adherence to righteousness or 'dharma'. People of virtue are those who have a deep understanding of right and wrong, and consistently choose to do what is right. 'Mature knowledge' refers to wisdom that comes from experience, learning, and deep understanding, not just superficial knowledge.\n\nThe verse further suggests that these relationships should not be formed rashly or arbitrarily. The ruler should 'ponder', 'discern' and 'choose' these friendships carefully, understanding the intrinsic worth of these individuals and the potential benefits of their friendship. This verse, thus, underlines the importance of prudence and discernment in forming valuable relationships.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can apply to anyone, not just rulers. It encourages us to recognize the value of virtuous and wise companionship and to seek it out thoughtfully and deliberately. Such relationships not only enrich us personally but also guide us towards better decisions and actions..The kural verse:உற்றநோய் நீக்கி உறாஅமை முற்காக்கும்பெற்றியார்ப் பேணிக் கொளல். ,translates to :Cherish the help of men of skill  Who ward and safe-guard you from ill,and it's explantion is :Kural 442 emphasizes the importance of strategic foresight and proactive problem-solving in leadership. It advises a king, which can be interpreted as any leader or person in power, to seek out and nurture individuals who possess the ability to not just solve existing problems but also to anticipate and prevent potential future challenges.\n\nThe verse suggests that the leader should regard these individuals with kindness and respect, considering them as valuable allies. This highlights the importance of teamwork and collaboration in effective leadership. \n\nFurthermore, this Kural also underscores the significance of preventive measures rather than just reactive solutions. It advises leaders to always be prepared and to think ahead, thus reducing the chances of being caught unprepared by unforeseen difficulties.\n\nIn a broader sense, this Kural can also be applied to everyday life, encouraging us to surround ourselves with wise and foresighted individuals who can help us negotiate the challenges of life. \n\nIn essence, Kural 442 advocates for strategic thinking, proactive problem-solving, and the importance of good company in leadership and life..The kural verse:அரியவற்று ளெல்லாம் அரிதே பெரியாரைப்பேணித் தமராக் கொளல். ,translates to :Honour and have the great your own  Is rarest of the rare things known,and it's explantion is :Kural 443 emphasizes the significance and challenges of establishing close relationships with influential and accomplished individuals. It states that to value, respect, and form a bond with such individuals is the toughest task among all tasks. This is because it demands a deep understanding of their aspirations, emotions, and preferences, a willingness to serve their needs, and a genuine interest in their activities.\n\nThe verse suggests that a relationship with such individuals is not merely about proximity or acquaintance, but about a profound connection based on shared values, mutual respect, and reciprocal affection. It implies that forming such a bond requires patience, wisdom, and the ability to adapt to their expectations.\n\nIn a broader sense, this kural underscores the importance of networking and forming valuable relationships in life. It advises that, while it may be challenging, creating meaningful relationships with influential people can have significant benefits, potentially opening up new avenues for personal growth and success..The kural verse:தம்மிற் பெரியார் தமரா ஒழுகுதல்வன்மையு ளெல்லாந் தலை. ,translates to :To have betters as intimates  Power of all powers promotes,and it's explantion is :Kural 444 emphasizes the power of humility and the importance of learning from those who are wiser and more experienced. It suggests that the greatest strength lies in acknowledging and respecting the wisdom of those who are superior to us in knowledge and understanding, and adapting their wisdom into our own lives.\n\nIn essence, this verse encourages us to form relationships with people who are wiser and more knowledgeable than ourselves, and to follow their guidance and advice. This is because their wisdom and experience can greatly enhance our own understanding and capabilities. This doesn't mean blindly following others, but rather seeking out and appreciating the wisdom that they offer.\n\nThe verse implies that this kind of humility and willingness to learn is, in fact, a sign of true strength. It shows an openness to new ideas, a recognition of one's own limitations, and a commitment to personal growth and improvement. This, according to the verse, is the highest form of power.\n\nThe cultural context of this verse lies in the Indian tradition of respecting elders and scholars, who are seen as sources of wisdom and guidance. It also resonates with a universal truth that humility and continuous learning are key to personal and professional success..The kural verse:சூழ்வார்கண் ணாக ஒழுகலான் மன்னவன்சூழ்வாரைக் சூழ்ந்து கொளல். ,translates to :Ministers are the monarch's eyes  Round him should be the right and wise,and it's explantion is :Kural 445 emphasizes the importance of careful selection and utilization of ministers by a king. Understanding that a king cannot manage the entire kingdom single-handedly, the Kural suggests the king to use his ministers as his 'eyes', helping him to see and manage different parts of the kingdom.\n\nHowever, it cautions that the king should not blindly employ anyone as his minister. Instead, he should meticulously examine their character, qualifications, and abilities before engaging them. The ministers should be wise, capable of understanding the complexities of ruling, and have a clear vision for the kingdom's well-being. \n\nThe Kural underscores that the success or failure of a kingdom largely depends on the quality of its ministers. Hence, selecting the right people for this crucial role is of paramount importance. The king must surround himself with capable and trustworthy individuals who can provide accurate and insightful advice, thereby aiding in wise decision-making and effective governance. \n\nIn a broader context, this verse is also applicable to modern leadership in any organization, highlighting the importance of choosing the right team or advisors to ensure successful administration and achievement of objectives..The kural verse:தக்கா ரினத்தனாய்த் தானொழுக வல்லானைச்செற்றார் செயக்கிடந்த தில். ,translates to :To move with worthy friends who knows  Has none to fear from frightful foes,and it's explantion is :The Kural 446 emphasizes the importance of maintaining a good company and acting wisely. It implies that when a person is associated with the wise and the learned, and when he conducts himself in line with their wisdom and guidance, he becomes invulnerable to any harm that his enemies might plan against him.\n\nThis verse underlines the power of prudent action and good companionship. When a person surrounds himself with individuals of wisdom and virtue, he naturally imbibes their qualities and learns to act wisely. This not only helps him grow personally and professionally, but also shields him from potential harm. His enemies find no loopholes or weaknesses in him to exploit, and thus, are left with nothing to act against him.\n\nIn essence, this verse suggests that wisdom and the right companionship serve as the best defense against any harm or ill-will. By acting wisely and choosing our companions thoughtfully, we can protect ourselves from potential threats and ensure our well-being..The kural verse:இடிக்குந் துணையாரை யாள்வரை யாரேகெடுக்குந் தகைமை யவர். ,translates to :No foe can foil his powers  whose friends reprove him when he errs,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse emphasizes the power and invincibility of those who have wise and courageous advisors at their side. The verse poses a rhetorical question, asking, \"Who can defeat an individual who has advisors capable of providing stern, constructive criticism when necessary?\"\n\nThe verse suggests that having advisors who are willing to provide honest feedback and correct missteps is a significant strength. Such advisors can guide a person towards moral, ethical, and wise decisions, thereby helping them to avoid mistakes and the potential for downfall. \n\nIn a broader context, this verse underscores the importance of surrounding oneself with people who are not just sycophantic or blindly supportive, but those who are honest, wise, and unafraid to voice their opinions. This could apply to leaders in all spheres, including politics, business, and academia. \n\nIn essence, the verse is a reflection on the power of constructive criticism and the strength of leadership that is open to such feedback. A person who has such advisors is considered virtually invincible..The kural verse:இடிப்பாரை இல்லாத ஏமரா மன்னன்கெடுப்பா ரிலானுங் கெடும். ,translates to :The careless king whom none reproves  Ruins himself sans harmful foes,and it's explantion is :Kural 448 emphasizes the importance of having wise counselors for a ruler or a king. In this verse, Valluvar points out that a king who lacks advisors capable of pointing out his mistakes and shortcomings will eventually meet his downfall, even if there are no external threats or enemies.\n\nThe verse underscores the significance of criticism and correction in leadership. A leader without the provision of constructive criticism is like a ship without a compass, drifting aimlessly and prone to disaster. Even if there are no external forces to cause harm, the absence of internal checks and balances can lead to self-destruction.\n\nThe mention of 'rebuke' in the verse suggests the necessity of having advisors who are fearless and honest, unafraid to point out the king's errors. This is a call for transparency, openness, and accountability in governance, which are cornerstones of good leadership. It warns that leaders who surround themselves with yes-men, who always agree and never criticize, are setting themselves up for failure.\n\nOverall, this verse from the Thirukkural teaches us that wise counsel is not only beneficial but also essential for a leader's survival and success. A leader must welcome criticism, learn from it, and use it as a tool for self-improvement and better governance..The kural verse:முதலிலார்க ஊதிய மில்லை மதலையாஞ்சார்பிலார்க் கில்லை நிலை. ,translates to :No capital, no gain in trade  No prop secure sans good comrade,and it's explantion is :Kural 449 emphasizes the importance of having resources or support to achieve stability and gain. The first part of the verse states that without capital, there can be no gain, drawing a parallel with business where investment is necessary to reap profits. Similarly, the second part of the verse extends this concept to the realm of personal stability and societal structure. It suggests that without a reliable support system or backing, one can't achieve a permanent or stable state. \n\nIn essence, this Kural highlights the crucial role that resources, whether financial or in the form of support, play in achieving success and stability. Just as a business needs initial capital to generate income, individuals also need support (from friends, family, or society) to maintain their stability and thrive. This verse is a timeless wisdom that holds true in any context or era..The kural verse:பல்லார் பகைகொளலிற் பத்தடுத்த தீமைத்தேநல்லார் தொடர்கை விடல். ,translates to :To give up good friends is ten times worse  Than being hated by countless foes,and it's explantion is :This Kural, number 450, emphasizes the importance of maintaining associations with virtuous and good-natured individuals in one's life. The verse suggests that breaking ties with such individuals is far more detrimental than incurring the wrath or enmity of many others. The verse uses the multiplier of 'tenfold' to highlight the gravity of the situation, stressing that the damage caused by abandoning good company is ten times worse than attracting the hostility of many.\n\nIn other words, the wisdom and moral support that we receive from virtuous individuals is invaluable. When we lose such associations, we not only lose their support and guidance but also expose ourselves to the influence of less virtuous individuals, which can lead to moral decay and a decline in character. This Kural encourages us to understand and appreciate the value of good company, and to strive to maintain such relationships, even in the face of adversity. \n\nCulturally, this Kural emphasizes the traditional Tamil value placed on moral and virtuous living, and the importance of good company in achieving such a life. It also reflects the community-oriented nature of Tamil society, where relationships and associations play a significant role in individual development and character formation..The kural verse:சிற்றினம் அஞ்சும் பெருமை சிறுமைதான்சுற்றமாச் சூழ்ந்து விடும். ,translates to :The ignoble the noble fear  The mean hold them as kinsmen dear,and it's explantion is :The Kural 451 emphasizes the difference in the nature of noble and low-minded individuals in terms of their association. It states that truly great people, who possess virtues and high principles, are wary of associating with those who are base or lowly. This is because they understand the potential negative influence and degradation that such association could bring to their own character and reputation.\n\nOn the contrary, the kural observes that those who are low-minded or lack high moral standards do not shy away from mingling with their own kind. They regard such association as normal, and even desirable, often being unable to discern the detrimental effects it could have on their moral and social standing.\n\nIn a broader sense, this kural advises individuals to be mindful of their associations, as it significantly impacts their character and the way they are perceived in society. Those who aspire to be great should surround themselves with individuals who share the same moral values and principles. Conversely, low-minded individuals who do not care about such things will continue to associate with the base, further deepening their own fallacies.\n\nIn summary, Kural 451 is a moral lesson on the importance of good association and the hazards of ill company. The company we keep not only reflects our character but also shapes it. So, it is important to choose it wisely..The kural verse:நிலத்தியல்பால் நீர்திரிந் தற்றாகும் மாந்தர்க்குஇனத்தியல்ப தாகும் அறிவு. ,translates to :With soil changes water's taste  With mates changes the mental state,and it's explantion is :Kural 452 focuses on the influence of one's environment on their character and behavior. It uses the metaphor of water adapting to the nature of the soil it flows through. Just like water changes its nature based on the soil, a person's character is also largely influenced by their surroundings and the people they associate with.\n\nThe kural emphasizes the importance of being mindful of our surroundings and the company we keep. It teaches that our environment and associations have the power to mold our character and worldview. This is a universal truth and holds relevance in all cultures and times. \n\nIn a broader sense, the kural advises us to choose our associations wisely as they have a significant impact on shaping our character, values, and ultimately, our destiny. It also hints at the concept of social conditioning, where our thoughts and behaviors are largely influenced by societal norms and expectations.\n\nTo sum up, Thiruvalluvar, through this kural, educates us on the profound influence of our environment and company on our character. It serves as a reminder to consciously choose positive and inspiring environments and associates for our personal growth and development..The kural verse:மனத்தானாம் மாந்தர்க் குணர்ச்சி இனத்தானாம்இன்னான் எனப்படுஞ் சொல். ,translates to :Wisdom depends upon the mind  The worth of man upon his friend,and it's explantion is :Kural 453 delves into the profound influence of one's companionship or association on one's character, despite the innate cognitive abilities of the mind. \n\nThe verse emphasizes that while innate intelligence or the ability to perceive and understand is a product of one's mind, the character, which is often recognized, appraised, and described by others, is significantly shaped by the company one keeps. \n\nIn essence, this Kural suggests that one's social environment plays a vital role in molding one's character, irrespective of one's inherent intellectual capacity. The verse underlines the importance of good companionship, indicating that positive affiliations help in nurturing and refining one's character. \n\nTherefore, it implies that one should be cautious about the company one keeps, as it can either enhance or mar one's character..The kural verse:மனத்து ளதுபோலக் காட்டி ஒருவற்குஇனத்துள தாகும் அறிவு. ,translates to :Wisdom seems to come from mind  But it truly flows from the kind,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural emphasizes the influence that one's companions or social circle can have on their wisdom and intelligence. At a surface level, it might seem as though a person's wisdom resides solely within their own mind. But in reality, as the verse suggests, that wisdom is significantly shaped by the people they interact and associate with.\n\nEssentially, this verse is highlighting the impact of one's environment and social interactions on their intellectual development. It underscores the importance of surrounding oneself with wise, knowledgeable, and positive individuals. As the saying goes, 'You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with,' this verse is a testament to that wisdom. \n\nIn a broader sense, it underlines the significance of community and collective wisdom. It encourages individuals to seek out and foster relationships with those who can positively influence their intellectual growth and development. In doing so, it also warns against the potential harms of being in the company of those who might hinder or negatively impact such growth.\n\nThus, the verse is a reminder of the power of companionship and social influence in shaping one's wisdom and understanding. It is a call to be mindful of the company we keep and the relationships we nurture as they play a vital role in our intellectual and personal development..The kural verse:மனந்தூய்மை செய்வினை தூய்மை இரண்டும்இனந்தூய்மை தூவா வரும். ,translates to :Purity of the thought and deed  Comes from good company indeed,and it's explantion is :Kural 455 emphasizes the importance of keeping good company, suggesting that it's the key to maintaining both purity of mind and purity of conduct. The verse asserts that when one is in the company of virtuous and morally upright individuals, it naturally leads to the cultivation of a pure mind and righteous actions. \n\nThe verse underscores the idea that our environment and the company we keep significantly influence our thoughts and deeds. When we surround ourselves with individuals who uphold moral values, we are more likely to emulate these values, leading to a purity of mind - free from negative or harmful thoughts - and conduct that is characterized by ethical actions. \n\nTherefore, the verse encourages us to be mindful of the company we keep, as it plays a pivotal role in shaping our mental and behavioral purity. This Kural thus highlights the profound influence of one's social circle on personal growth and character development..The kural verse:மனந்தூயார்க் கெச்சம்நன் றாகும் இனந்தூயார்க்குஇல்லைநன் றாகா வினை. ,translates to :Pure-hearted get good progeny  Pure friendship acts with victory,and it's explantion is :Kural 456 emphasizes the power of purity in thought and association. According to the verse, individuals who maintain a pure mind, free from malice and imbued with righteousness, will leave behind a legacy of goodness. This legacy is not just material but also encompasses virtues and moral values, which will reflect positively on their lineage and posterity.\n\nFurther, the verse suggests that those who associate themselves with the virtuous and pure-hearted will not engage in deeds that are unrighteous or harmful. The purity of their companionship will guide them towards actions that are inherently good and beneficial. This highlights the importance of the company one keeps and its influence on one's actions and behaviors.\n\nIn essence, this Kural teaches us that a pure mind and virtuous company shape a person's actions and legacy, steering them towards goodness and righteousness. It emphasizes the importance of inner purity and positive associations in leading a morally upright life..The kural verse:மனநலம் மன்னுயிர்க் காக்கம் இனநலம்எல்லாப் புகழும் தரும். ,translates to :Goodness of mind increases gain  Good friendship fosters fame again,and it's explantion is :This Kural (verse) emphasizes the importance of mental and societal goodness in human life. The first half of the verse underlines that a good and virtuous mind is the true wealth of a person. This implies that material wealth is transient, but the wealth of a virtuous mind is everlasting and beneficial for the soul. It suggests that possessing a good mind, filled with kindness, empathy, and righteousness, is the real treasure, which no external circumstance can steal.\n\nThe second half of the verse extols the value of good society. It says that being in a good society, or a community that promotes virtue, positivity, and mutual respect, will bring all praise. This can be understood as the recognition, respect, and admiration one gains from living in such a society. It implies that being a part of a good society fosters development and enhances one's reputation by encouraging good deeds and moral behavior. \n\nIn essence, this verse promotes the cultivation of inner virtues and choosing a socially conducive environment for a rewarding and praiseworthy life..The kural verse:மனநலம் நன்குடைய ராயினும் சான்றோர்க்குஇனநலம் ஏமாப் புடைத்து. ,translates to :Men of wisdom, though good in mind  In friends of worth a new strength find,and it's explantion is :Kural 458 acknowledges the importance of keeping good company in enhancing one's virtue, no matter how virtuous one might inherently be. This verse emphasizes the power of environment and companionship in shaping a person's character and values.\n\nThe first line states that even if someone possesses inherent goodness of character - a noble heart, it is the company they keep that ultimately reaffirms and strengthens their virtue.\n\nThe second line elaborates that, for those who are virtuous, the goodness of their company (or the community they belong to) acts as a strong protective shield. This could be interpreted as a warning against the influence of bad company that could potentially tarnish one's inherent goodness.\n\nIn essence, this Kural suggests that a person, no matter how virtuous, can be influenced by their surroundings. Therefore, it is important to surround oneself with good company, as it serves as a confirmation and protection of one's inherent virtues. This underlines the significance of social interactions and the role it plays in the development and preservation of one's moral character..The kural verse:மனநலத்தின் ஆகும் மறுமைமற் றஃதும்இனநலத்தின் ஏமாப் புடைத்து. ,translates to :Good mind decides the future bliss  Good company gains strength to this,and it's explantion is :Kural 459 emphasizes the significance of an individual's state of mind and the environment they associate with in achieving future bliss. Essentially, it suggests that the purity and goodness of one's mind pave the way for future happiness. The 'goodness of mind' here refers to positive thoughts, ethical values, and righteous actions. It suggests that individuals who nurture such mental states are likely to experience long-term peace and happiness.\n\nHowever, the verse also acknowledges the role of one's surroundings, stating that this 'goodness of mind' further strengthens when one is in the company of good people. The 'society of the good' refers to being in the company of virtuous, kind, and morally upright individuals. Their influence can reinforce one's positive state of mind, thereby enhancing the potential for future bliss.\n\nIn essence, this Kural verse teaches that the path to lasting happiness lies in nurturing a positive and virtuous state of mind and associating with good people who can reinforce these values.

It suggests that there is no greater source of distress or sorrow than being associated with such individuals. The negative influence of the wicked can lead one astray, causing turmoil and hardships in their life.\n\nThe crux of this verse lies in the understanding that our company significantly influences our character, actions, and ultimately our life. Hence, keeping good company is the most beneficial support one can have, and avoiding bad company is the greatest relief from potential sorrow. \n\nIn short, this Kural emphasizes the role of one's environment in shaping one's character and life, urging us to choose our company wisely.

It underlines the significance of proper planning, understanding our capabilities, and being aware of the potential challenges before starting any task. If we proceed without these considerations, we may inadvertently benefit our competitors or adversaries, as our failures can provide them with opportunities.\n\nIn short, this Kural advises us to always be mindful of our actions and decisions, and to take time to assess the situation fully before acting, as rushing into things can have unintended consequences and may even benefit those we wish to overcome..The kural verse:செய்தக்க அல்ல செயக்கெடும் செய்தக்கசெய்யாமை யானுங் கெடும். ,translates to :Doing unfit action ruins Failing fit-act also ruins,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse, Kural 466, essentially talks about the consequences of actions, whether they are actions committed or actions omitted.

This could be anything that goes against moral, ethical, societal or personal principles. The consequences of such actions can be detrimental, leading to ruin or suffering.\n\nThe second part of the verse, \"he also will perish who does not do what it is fit to do\", underscores that inaction in the face of duty or responsibility can also lead to negative consequences. Sometimes, not doing what is necessary or expected can be just as damaging as doing what is wrong. This could refer to failing to uphold responsibilities, neglecting duties, or refraining from taking action when it's needed.\n\nOverall, this verse highlights the importance of mindful action. It encourages us to be aware of our actions and their potential consequences, and to strive to do what is right while refraining from what is wrong.

Once the task has been started, reconsidering or doubting the initial plan is regarded as folly or a mistake.\n\nThe verse promotes the idea of decisive action based on well-thought-out plans. It cautions against the indecisiveness that might arise if one starts to reconsider the course of action after already initiating the task. Such an act not only wastes time but also impedes the progress of the task.\n\nThis verse is a timeless piece of wisdom, applicable in all spheres of life. Whether it's a personal decision, a professional project, or a social initiative, careful planning and steadfast execution, without second thoughts, are crucial for success. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, through this kural, advises us to 'Think before you act and stick to your decision once you have started acting'.

It asserts that no matter how many people support or contribute to a task, if it is not carried out through the appropriate procedures, it is bound to fail.\n\nThe verse underlines the significance of planning and strategizing in any endeavor, be it small or large. Just having a large number of people supporting or participating in an endeavor does not guarantee its success. The methodology, strategy, and execution plan are pivotal in determining the outcome of any effort.\n\nIn essence, the verse encourages thoughtful planning, understanding of the task at hand, and the use of suitable methods for successful execution. It serves as a reminder that 'how' something is done is as important as 'what' is done.\n\nThis Kural could be applied in various aspects of life, including personal tasks, community projects, or corporate strategies. It urges us to place importance on the process, not just the end goal. This wisdom could be particularly useful in today's fast-paced world, where the focus is often on quick results, sometimes at the expense of proper planning and execution..The kural verse:நன்றாற்ற லுள்ளுந் தவுறுண்டு அவரவர்பண்பறிந் தாற்றாக் கடை. ,translates to :Attune the deeds to habitude Or ev'n good leads to evil feud,and it's explantion is :This Kural (Verse 469) emphasizes the importance of understanding the unique dispositions or characteristics of individuals before interacting or dealing with them. The verse suggests that good deeds or actions could end up being counterproductive or harmful if they are not tailored to the recipient's personality, needs, and circumstances. \n\nThe essence of this verse is that understanding people's unique traits, emotions, and motivations is a critical part of being able to interact with them effectively and positively. It teaches us that what might be beneficial or well-intentioned for one person may not necessarily be so for another due to their distinct personalities and circumstances. \n\nIn other words, even kindness and good actions need to be customized and executed thoughtfully, taking into account the individual's specific characteristics and needs. Acting without such understanding could lead to unintended negative consequences, turning good intentions into failures. \n\nThis Kural encourages empathy, discernment, and understanding in our dealings with others, highlighting the nuanced nature of human relationships and interactions..The kural verse:எள்ளாத எண்ணிச் செயல்வேண்டும் தம்மோடுகொள்ளாத கொள்ளாது உலகு. ,translates to :Do deeds above reproachfulness The world refutes uncomely mess,and it's explantion is :Kural 470 emphasizes the importance of conscious decision-making and acting in accordance with one's position in life. It advises individuals to reflect and engage in actions that will not lead to disapproval or reproach. This is based on the understanding that society generally does not accept actions that are inconsistent with one's status or position.\n\nThe verse essentially imparts the wisdom that one's actions should be fitting to their station in life. This alignment does not only help maintain social harmony but also ensures self-respect and dignity. It discourages behavior that is unfitting or inappropriate to one's status, as such actions would likely cause disapproval and criticism from the world.\n\nMoreover, the verse suggests that before undertaking any action, one should consider its implications and the potential backlash it may draw. This thoughtful approach prevents unnecessary embarrassment and maintains one's reputation in society. The Kural thus underscores the importance of mindful action and the role of societal norms in guiding individual behavior..The kural verse:வினைவலியும் தன்வலியும் மாற்றான் வலியும்துணைவலியும் தூக்கிச் செயல். ,translates to :Judge act and might and foeman's strength The allies' strength and go at length,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse emphasizes the importance of strategic planning and careful consideration before taking any action. It urges one to evaluate various aspects - the magnitude of the task at hand, one's own capacity or strength, the power or strength of the adversary or opponent, and the strength of allies on both sides. \n\nIn other words, before embarking on any endeavor, one must assess the challenges that lie ahead, understand their own abilities and limitations, estimate the strength of potential obstacles, and consider the support they have or can expect from others. \n\nThis Kural underscores the wisdom in taking a balanced and well-informed approach to any situation, thereby mitigating risks and enhancing the chances of success. This principle is applicable not only in warfare or political scenarios, as the literal interpretation might suggest, but in all aspects of life - personal, professional, or societal. \n\nStrategic planning, self-awareness, understanding of the competition, and leveraging allies are universal concepts that contribute to the successful execution of any undertaking. Thus, this verse from Thiru Kural delivers a timeless message of prudence and strategic thinking..The kural verse:ஒல்வ தறிவது அறிந்ததன் கண்தங்கிச்செல்வார்க்குச் செல்லாதது இல். ,translates to :Nothing hampers the firm who know What they can and how to go,and it's explantion is :Kural 472 emphasizes the essence of preparation and understanding one's own abilities before undertaking any endeavor. The verse suggests that there is no task that cannot be accomplished by those who have a thorough understanding of their own capabilities and the task at hand, prior to taking any action.\n\nIn practical terms, this verse stresses the importance of self-knowledge, planning, and strategic thinking. It asserts that understanding one's strengths and weaknesses, assessing the nature of the task, and preparing for it meticulously is a recipe for success. The verse promotes the idea that with the right amount of effort and planning, no goal is unreachable.\n\nIn essence, this verse from Thiru Kural teaches us the value of strategic planning, understanding our capacity, and the power of preparation. It encourages us to be self-aware, strategic, and well-prepared in all our endeavors, ensuring a higher probability of success..The kural verse:உடைத்தம் வலியறியார் ஊக்கத்தின் ஊக்கிஇடைக்கண் முரிந்தார் பலர். ,translates to :Many know not their meagre might Their pride breaks up in boastful fight,and it's explantion is :Kural 473 speaks about the dangers of overconfidence and the lack of self-awareness, particularly in situations of conflict or adversity. The verse emphasizes the importance of understanding one's own capabilities and limitations before embarking on any significant venture, such as a war in this context.\n\nThe verse states that there are many who, without being mindful of their own strength or power, have enthusiastically rushed into battles or conflicts, driven by their fervor and pride. However, as they underestimate their weaknesses and overestimate their strengths, they often find themselves failing or breaking down midway, unable to carry on and finish what they have started.\n\nThis verse serves as a reminder that one should always assess their own abilities and adequately prepare before taking on any challenge. Overconfidence and lack of self-awareness can lead to failures, disappointments, and even disasters. It suggests a moral lesson that humility and self-awareness are essential for success in any endeavor.\n\nIn a broader perspective, this lesson can be applied not only in warfare but also in our daily life situations, such as in business, academic pursuits, or personal goals. The underlying message is to encourage thoughtful planning, careful assessment of one's abilities, and avoiding overconfidence for the successful completion of any task or goal..The kural verse:அமைந்தாங் கொழுகான் அளவறியான் தன்னைவியந்தான் விரைந்து கெடும். ,translates to :Who adapts not, outsteps measure And brags himself-his fall is sure,and it's explantion is :The Kural 474 emphasizes the peril of overestimating oneself without a true understanding of one's own capabilities and limitations. This verse is a cautionary statement against the dangers of self-flattery and self-deception, which are seen as a quick path to downfall.\n\nIn essence, the verse is cautioning against arrogance and self-delusion. It warns that if a person, ignorant of their real strength and capabilities, indulges in self-praise and overestimation, they are likely to fail quickly. This is because their actions and decisions, based on an inflated sense of self, will not be grounded in reality, and thus will lead to mistakes, failures and, eventually, ruin.\n\nThe verse underscores the importance of self-awareness and humility. It advises us to understand and acknowledge our strengths and weaknesses, rather than deluding ourselves with a false sense of superiority. This self-awareness, combined with respect for others' abilities, is seen as key to long-term success and survival. \n\nIn a broader cultural context, this verse also reflects the high value placed on modesty, humility, and self-awareness in the Tamil culture and tradition. The Thirukkural, as a whole, consistently promotes these virtues as necessary for a righteous and successful life..The kural verse:பீலிபெய் சாகாடும் அச்சிறும் அப்பண்டஞ்சால மிகுத்துப் பெயின். ,translates to :Even the gentle peacock's plume Cart's axle breaks by gross volume,and it's explantion is :Kural 475 is a profound verse that illustrates the importance of balance and moderation in all aspects of life. The verse metaphorically describes an axle of a cart, which, despite being loaded only with peacock feathers, will break if it is overloaded beyond its capacity. \n\nThis verse is a stark reminder of the consequences of excess, even if what is being dealt with might seem light or harmless. It implies that everything has its own capacity and tolerance level, and exceeding that limit, no matter how insignificant the load might seem, can lead to destruction or failure. \n\nThe metaphor of the axle and the peacock feathers can be applied to various aspects of life, such as physical health, relationships, work, or moral values. Even too much of a good thing can become harmful if it exceeds our capacity to handle it. The verse, thus, advocates for balance, moderation, and understanding one's own limits in all aspects of life. It's a reminder not to take anything for granted and always consider the capacity or limit before proceeding. \n\nIn a broader sense, it also conveys the message of respecting the natural limits set by nature and not to exploit or overburden anything beyond its capacity, as it may lead to irreversible damage or loss..The kural verse:நுனிக்கொம்பர் ஏறினார் அஃதிறந் தூக்கின்உயிர்க்கிறுதி ஆகி விடும். ,translates to :Beyond the branches' tip who skips Ends the life as his body rips,and it's explantion is :Kural 476 is a metaphorical verse that emphasizes the importance of understanding one's limitations and not taking undue risks that may be life-threatening. It likens a person's life to climbing a tree; if one climbs to the extreme end of a branch and still attempts to proceed further, it would ultimately lead to a fatal fall, symbolizing the end of life.\n\nThe verse encourages a sense of caution and foresight. It advises not to overestimate one's abilities or underestimate the risks involved in our actions. It warns us against going beyond our boundaries without proper consideration of the potential consequences.\n\nIn a broader context, this kural could be applied to various aspects of life such as career, relationships, ambitions, etc. It advises us to recognize our boundaries and not to push ourselves too far without considering the potential repercussions. It promotes a balance between ambition and caution, urging us to make calculated risks rather than reckless ones. \n\nIn essence, this kural teaches us the importance of knowing our limits and acting prudently within them to ensure our well-being and longevity..The kural verse:ஆற்றின் அறவறிந்து ஈக அதுபொருள்போற்றி வழங்கு நெறி. ,translates to :Know the limit; grant with measure This way give and guard your treasure,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse (Kural 477) emphasizes the importance of giving within one's means. It advises an individual to understand the extent of their capacity to give, and to donate accordingly. This acts as a safeguard for their wealth, as it ensures that they do not give beyond their means and end up in financial distress.\n\nThe verse conveys a practical perspective on charity, highlighting that while generosity is a virtue, it should be exercised with prudence. The giver should be aware of their own financial status and limitations before making a donation. By doing so, they can maintain their wealth without compromising on their charitable actions. \n\nThis Kural advocates for a balanced approach to giving, where the act of charity should not lead to self-deprivation but should be a sustainable practice that aligns with one's economic condition. It is not just about giving, but giving responsibly and thoughtfully, considering one's own welfare alongside the welfare of others..The kural verse:ஆகாறு அளவிட்டி தாயினுங் கேடில்லைபோகாறு அகலாக் கடை. ,translates to :The outflow must not be excess No matter how small income is,and it's explantion is :Kural 478 emphasizes the principle of financial prudence, advising that expenditures should always be within the limits of one's income. Thiruvalluvar, the author, suggests that even if a person's or a king's income is small, it would not lead to his downfall or ruin, as long as the expenses do not exceed the income.\n\nThis verse strongly advises against extravagant or unnecessary spending that exceeds one's income, regardless of whether the income is small or large. It promotes the idea of living within one's means and not going into debt. This principle is not only applicable to individuals but also to rulers and governments, as financial mismanagement can lead to the downfall of kingdoms and countries.\n\nIn a broader sense, this kural highlights the importance of balance and moderation in life. It encourages the practice of controlled consumption and wise financial management, which are key to maintaining stability and avoiding adversity. This wisdom from the ancient Tamil text is very much relevant even today, in personal life as well as in the management of modern economies..The kural verse:அளவறிந்து வாழாதான் வாழ்க்கை உளபோலஇல்லாகித் தோன்றாக் கெடும். ,translates to :Who does not know to live in bounds His life seems rich but thins and ends,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse stresses the importance of understanding the value and measure of one's possessions in order to live sustainably. The verse warns that those who live without a clear comprehension of their resources, assets, and their limitations might appear prosperous on the surface, but their prosperity would eventually decline and disappear. \n\nThe verse teaches us the concept of prudent management and utilization of resources. It implies that ignorance or negligence in understanding the extent of one's wealth and resources can lead to misuse or overuse, which in turn can result in loss and ruin. This principle can be applied not only to material wealth, but also to intangible resources such as time, energy, and talents. \n\nKnowing the measure of one's possessions promotes wise spending, effective resource management, and sustainable living, leading to consistent prosperity. On the contrary, living extravagantly without understanding one's limits can lead to sudden downfall. In essence, this verse is a reminder to live within one's means and to manage one's resources wisely to ensure long-term prosperity and stability..The kural verse:உளவரை தூக்காத ஒப்புர வாண்மைவளவரை வல்லைக் கெடும். ,translates to :Wealth amassed quickly vanishes Sans level if one lavishes,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse 480 emphasizes the importance of prudent and sustainable giving. It suggests that while generosity is a noble trait, one must also consider their own financial capabilities before giving. \n\nThe verse metaphorically communicates that if a person continues to give without considering their own capacity or wealth, their resources will deplete rapidly. This is akin to a person who keeps giving water from a tank without checking the level of water left in it. Sooner or later, the tank will be empty.\n\nIn other words, while it is commendable to help others, it is also important not to do so at the risk of your own financial stability. One should give in proportion to their means. This verse hence serves as a cautionary note against reckless and unsustainable generosity, and emphasizes the need for a balance between generosity and prudence. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse also signifies the sustainability aspect in any resource utilization. It suggests that any resource, if used without considering its availability or replenishing it, will soon perish. Therefore, it emphasizes the need for careful and sustainable use of resources. \n\nIn summary, the verse promotes balanced and sustainable generosity and utilization of resources. It underscores the principle that charity begins at home and one should not compromise their own needs in the process of helping others..The kural verse:பகல்வெல்லும் கூகையைக் காக்கை இகல்வெல்லும்வேந்தர்க்கு வேண்டும் பொழுது. ,translates to :By day the crow defeats the owl Kings need right time their foes to quell,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of timing in achieving victory. It uses the analogy of a crow and an owl to illustrate this point. In the day time, a crow, though smaller and weaker, can overcome an owl because the owl, being nocturnal, is at a disadvantage during the day. The owl's strength and prowess are diminished in the daytime, and the crow can take advantage of this.\n\nTranslating this analogy to a king's battle scenario, the verse suggests that even a powerful enemy can be defeated if the timing is right. Just as the crow waits for the day to confront the owl, a king should also choose the most opportune time to engage with his enemies. The king must consider various factors such as his enemy's weaknesses, his own strengths, and the most advantageous circumstances to ensure victory. \n\nSo, this Kural teaches us that strategic timing is as critical as strength and power in achieving success, not just in warfare but in any challenging situation in life. It encourages us to understand and take advantage of the right timing or 'opportune moment' to turn situations in our favor. The wisdom of this verse is timeless and applicable in various contexts, from personal endeavors to business strategies..The kural verse:பருவத்தோடு ஒட்ட ஒழுகல் திருவினைத்தீராமை ஆர்க்குங் கயிறு. ,translates to :Well-ordered seasoned act is cord That fortune binds in bon accord,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the significance of timing in every action. It states that acting in accordance with the appropriate time or season is akin to securely binding success with a strong cord. The cord here represents the unflinching result that arises from well-timed actions.\n\nThe principle applies to anyone, including a king, who seeks to be successful in their endeavours. It is not enough to simply perform an action or duty; it must be done at the right time, when conditions are most conducive to success. \n\nFor example, a farmer sowing seeds must do so at the correct time of the year, when the climate and soil are most suitable for growth. If the seeds are sown out of season, the crop may fail, no matter how diligently the farmer tends his field. Similarly, a leader or a king should make decisions and implement policies when the time is right. If timing is ignored, even the most well-intended actions may lead to failure.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse teaches us the importance of patience, foresight, and strategic planning in every walk of life. It reminds us that timing is a key factor in determining the outcome of our actions, and stresses the necessity of aligning our actions with the natural and situational rhythms of life..The kural verse:அருவினை யென்ப உளவோ கருவியான்காலம் அற஧ந்து செயின். ,translates to :What is hard for him who acts With proper means and time and tacts?,and it's explantion is :The Kural 483 emphasizes the importance of right timing and the use of appropriate tools or methods in accomplishing any task. It asserts that no task is too difficult or impossible for the one who acts with the right resources and at the right time.\n\nThe verse suggests that the key to success lies in the strategic combination of the right tools or skills (referred to as 'instruments') and the right timing. The term 'instruments' can be seen as a metaphor for resources, skills, or methods one has at their disposal. The 'right time' signifies the ideal or most opportune moment to act.\n\nThis verse carries a universal message that applies to all spheres of life, from personal endeavors to professional projects. It encourages thoughtful planning, appropriate skill application, and timely action. The underlying wisdom of the verse is that the right combination of resources and timing can overcome any challenges and yield successful outcomes. \n\nIn essence, this Kural teaches us the value of strategic planning, resourcefulness, and the significance of timing in achieving our goals, stating that there's nothing in the world that's too difficult to accomplish if these elements are in place..The kural verse:ஞாலம் கருதினுங் கைகூடுங் காலம்கருதி இடத்தாற் செயின். ,translates to :Choose proper time and act and place Even the world you win with ease,and it's explantion is :This Kural emphasizes the importance of timing and context in accomplishing one's goals or objectives. It encourages individuals to not only have great ambitions, such as the conquest of the world, but also to act wisely and appropriately. \n\nThe verse suggests that even the most monumental tasks can be accomplished if one acts at the right time and in the right place. This is a call for strategic planning, patience, and understanding of one's environment. It highlights the need to align actions with the rhythm of circumstances, rather than rushing into actions impulsively.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, the poet, underlines the significance of proper timing and favorable conditions in the successful execution of any endeavor. Even if one aspires to conquer the world, the objective is attainable if actions are taken at the appropriate time and in the appropriate context.\n\nThis philosophy can be adapted to all walks of life, from personal goals to professional projects, emphasizing the importance of strategic planning, situational awareness, and seizing opportunities when they arise..The kural verse:காலம் கருதி இருப்பர் கலங்காதுஞாலம் கருது பவர். ,translates to :Who want to win the world sublime Wait unruffled biding their time,and it's explantion is :Kural 485 emphasizes the importance of timing and patience in the pursuit of great accomplishments. It suggests that those who carefully consider the right moment to act, instead of rushing into decisions or actions, can even conquer the world. This verse is about strategic patience and the wisdom of waiting for opportune moments.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse advises us to be mindful of the time and situations we are in. It suggests that rushing or forcing things often leads to failure or unnecessary complications. The right timing, combined with preparedness and patience, can lead to triumph over even the most formidable challenges. \n\nThe cultural context of this verse stems from the ancient Tamil wisdom that underscores the virtue of patience, and the belief in the cyclical nature of time where every event has a destined moment.\n\nIn essence, this Kural promotes the understanding that success often comes to those who strategically wait for the right time, instead of those who rush without considering the implications of their actions..The kural verse:ஊக்க முடையான் ஒடுக்கம் பொருதகர்தாக்கற்குப் பேருந் தகைத்து. ,translates to :By self-restraint stalwarts keep fit Like rams retreating but to butt,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse (Kural 486) emphasizes the importance of self-restraint and strategic patience in the face of adversity. The verse metaphorically compares the composed demeanor of a person brimming with energy and potential to a battle-ready ram preparing for a fight. \n\nThe ram, before launching an attack, steps back and gathers its strength. This retreat isn't a sign of weakness or fear, but a strategic preparation for a powerful charge. Similarly, an individual filled with energy and potential, when faced with challenges or setbacks, may display a calm and composed demeanor. This is not indicative of their inability or fear, but their strategic patience, waiting for the right opportunity to channel their energy effectively. \n\nThe verse underlines that often strength and success lie not in rash reactions, but in careful strategy, patience, and the effective use of one's potential at the right moment. It encourages the practice of self-restraint and thoughtful action, rather than impulsive behavior, in dealing with life's challenges..The kural verse:பொள்ளென ஆங்கே புறம்வேரார் காலம்பார்த்துஉள்வேர்ப்பர் ஒள்ளி யவர். ,translates to :The wise jut not their vital fire They watch their time with hidden ire,and it's explantion is :The Thirukkural verse 487 emphasizes the importance of self-restraint and strategic thinking, particularly when confronted with hostility or provocation.\n\nThe verse suggests that the wise do not instantly express their anger, even if antagonized. They do not allow their immediate emotional responses to dictate their actions. Instead, they exercise patience and restrain their anger, not letting it be visible outwardly. \n\nThis approach serves two purposes: firstly, it does not alert the provoker of their anger, keeping them unaware of any potential backlash. Secondly, it provides the angered person with the time to decide the best course of action. They can strategize and wait for the right time to respond, ensuring their response is measured, effective, and beneficial rather than impulsive and potentially destructive.\n\nIn essence, the verse extols the virtues of patience, strategic thinking, and emotional control, particularly in situations of conflict. It implies that displaying immediate anger is not a sign of strength or wisdom, but that true wisdom lies in controlling one's emotions and responding in the most beneficial manner..The kural verse:செறுநரைக் காணின் சுமக்க இறுவரைகாணின் கிழக்காம் தலை. ,translates to :Bear with hostiles when you meet them Fell down their head in fateful time,and it's explantion is :The verse is essentially about the strategy and wisdom in dealing with adversaries. According to Thiruvalluvar, the poet who penned Thiru Kural, one should maintain a respectful and patient demeanor towards their enemies until the right moment for their downfall arrives. This strategy not only helps in maintaining a peaceful environment but also in catching the enemy off-guard.\n\nThe phrase \"his head will be easily brought low\" is metaphorically used to signify the enemy's downfall or defeat. The verse advises not to rush into conflict but to wait for the opportune moment, when the enemy is at their weakest or least expecting, to strike. This approach requires patience, intelligence, and discernment.\n\nThe Tamil explications also reflect the same sentiment, advising to bear with the enmity patiently until the appropriate time comes for the enemy's downfall. They highlight the importance of strategic patience in dealing with adversaries. \n\nIn a broader sense, the verse can also be interpreted as a general life philosophy, advising individuals to be patient, strategic, and respectful in any situation, even when dealing with adversaries or obstacles..The kural verse:எய்தற் கரியது இயைந்தக்கால் அந்நிலையேசெய்தற் கரிய செயல். ,translates to :When comes the season ripe and rare Dare and do hard things then and there,and it's explantion is :Kural 489 emphasizes the importance of seizing rare opportunities and acting promptly. The couplet suggests that when a unique, unusual opportunity arises, one should utilize it to accomplish tasks that are typically hard to achieve. \n\nThe essence of this verse lies within the concept of 'timing' and 'opportunity'. It suggests that opportunities are fleeting and rare. They may not come often and when they do, they should be grasped immediately and used to their maximum potential. Failing to do so might result in missed chances to accomplish great things. \n\nThis verse encourages proactive behavior, readiness and the ability to recognize opportunities when they arrive. It also highlights the importance of adaptability, as one needs to adjust their actions according to the situation at hand.\n\nIn a broader context, this verse can be applied to various aspects of life - both personal and professional. It could refer to a business opportunity, a chance to acquire knowledge, a moment of inspiration, or even a rare occasion to perform a good deed. The underlying message remains the same - seize the moment, act promptly, and utilize the opportunity to the fullest..The kural verse:கொக்கொக்க கூம்பும் பருவத்து மற்றதன்குத்தொக்க சீர்த்த இடத்து. ,translates to :In waiting time feign peace like stork In fighting time strike like its peck,and it's explantion is :Kural 490 is a beautiful verse that speaks about the virtues of patience and the strategic application of action. It uses the metaphor of a heron, a bird known for its patience and precision while hunting for its prey.\n\nThe first line of the verse, \"At the time when one should use self-control, let him restrain himself like a heron,\" suggests that there are moments in life that require self-restraint and patience. Just like a heron which stands still and waits patiently for the right moment to catch its prey, a person should also exercise patience and self-control in his actions. This could be in various aspects of life, such as waiting for the right opportunity to start a business, making important decisions, or dealing with complex problems.\n\nThe second line of the verse, \"and, let him like it, strike, when there is a favourable opportunity,\" implies that just as the heron strikes at the right moment to catch its prey, a person should also act decisively when the opportune moment arrives. It stresses the importance of timing in our actions and decisions, suggesting that success often depends on acting at the right time.\n\nIn essence, this verse promotes a balance between patience and decisive action. It encourages us to be patient and restrained when the time calls for it, while also urging us to act swiftly and decisively when the right opportunity presents itself. It reinforces the idea that wisdom lies in understanding the right time to wait and the right time to act..The kural verse:தொடங்கற்க எவ்வினையும் எள்ளற்க முற்றும்இடங்கண்ட பின்அல் லது. ,translates to :No action take, no foe despise Until you have surveyed the place,and it's explantion is :Kural 491 emphasizes the importance of strategy and careful planning in any undertaking, especially in matters of conflict or warfare. The verse advises a ruler or leader not to underestimate any opponent or hastily engage in conflict without proper planning and scouting of an appropriate location for the battle.\n\nThe idea of 'not despising an enemy' signifies that underestimating an opponent could lead to complacency, lack of preparation, and ultimately, defeat. Every adversary, no matter how seemingly insignificant, could pose a potential threat and should be treated with due respect and caution.\n\nThe second part of the verse, 'until he has obtained a suitable place for besieging him,' underscores the significance of strategic advantage in warfare. The 'place' here could be interpreted literally as the physical location of the battle, or metaphorically as a strategic advantage or the right circumstances. A well-planned strategy that considers the terrain, resources, and timing could tilt the scales of victory.\n\nIn broader terms, this verse can be applied to general life scenarios too. It advises not to underestimate any challenge or hastily dive into any task without proper planning and consideration of all factors. The wisdom of this verse lies in its emphasis on the importance of strategy, respect for the adversary, and careful planning in achieving success..The kural verse:முரண்சேர்ந்த மொய்ம்பி னவர்க்கும் அரண்சேர்ந்தாம்ஆக்கம் பலவுந் தரும். ,translates to :Many are gains of fortresses Ev'n to kings of power and prowess,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse (492) emphasizes the strategic importance of fortifications, even for those who are already strong and resourceful. The verse suggests that, while power and cunning strategies can certainly be advantageous in conflicts, there are unique benefits to be gained from having a fortified position.\n\nIn the context of warfare, a fortification provides physical protection, a vantage point for observing enemy movements, and a stronghold from which to launch counterattacks. It's a place of refuge and a symbol of power that can boost morale among the defenders. \n\nIn a broader, metaphorical sense, the 'fortification' can be seen as any form of security or advantage one has in a situation of conflict or competition. This could be anything from financial stability in a business context, to knowledge in an intellectual debate, or even emotional resilience in personal conflicts. \n\nThus, the verse is a timeless piece of wisdom emphasizing the importance of preparing defenses and securing your position, no matter how powerful or capable you may be. It's a reminder that even the strongest need to safeguard their interests and that having a strong defensive strategy can provide numerous benefits..The kural verse:ஆற்றாரும் ஆற்றி அடுப இடனறிந்துபோற்றார்கண் போற்றிச் செயின். ,translates to :Weaklings too withstand foe's offence In proper fields of strong defence,and it's explantion is :The Kural 493 emphasizes the power of strategy and prudence in any confrontation or challenge. It suggests that even those who might seem weak or powerless can overcome their adversaries if they smartly choose their battleground and wisely guard their own strengths and vulnerabilities.\n\nIn the context of warfare, it refers to choosing a battlefield where one's strengths can be magnified and weaknesses minimized, and ensuring personal safety and readiness before engaging with the enemy. However, this principle can be extended to all kinds of conflicts, challenges, or competitions in life, including personal, professional, or social scenarios.\n\nIn a broader sense, it advocates for strategic thinking, careful planning, and self-protection. It underscores that the might is not just about physical strength or resources, but also about the intelligence to use them effectively. By adopting such an approach, even the seemingly powerless can overcome stronger adversaries and achieve victory.\n\nHence, the verse inspires individuals to be strategic and cautious in their actions, emphasizing that prudence and careful planning can often triumph over sheer might or power..The kural verse:எண்ணியார் எண்ணம் இழப்பர் இடனறிந்துதுன்னியார் துன்னிச் செயின். ,translates to :If fighters fight in vantage field The plans of foes shall be baffled,and it's explantion is :Kural 494 emphasizes the importance of strategy and tactical acumen in conflict situations. The verse suggests that if those who are approaching an adversary choose their path wisely, taking into account the terrain, the conditions, and the strengths of their own side, they can put their enemy on the back foot. \n\nThe enemy, who had earlier conceived plans of defeating them, will be forced to abandon those thoughts. Essentially, this verse is about the power of strategic planning and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances, both of which can turn the tide of a conflict.\n\nIn broader terms, this can be applied to any situation in life where we face challenges or obstacles. It emphasizes the need for careful planning, understanding our strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the right path to approach the problem. This way, the thought of failure, which our challenges might have initially imposed on us, can be relinquished..The kural verse:நெடும்புனலுள் வெல்லும் முதலை அடும்புனலின்நீங்கின் அதனைப் பிற. ,translates to :In water crocodile prevails In land before others it fails,and it's explantion is :Kural 495 is an insightful reflection on the impact of environment and context on an individual's strength and abilities. The verse uses the metaphor of a crocodile, which is a powerful and dominant creature in its natural habitat - the water. In deep water, the crocodile is unrivaled, demonstrating its strength and dominance over other creatures. This symbolizes individuals or entities who excel in their familiar environments, utilizing their skills and capabilities to their maximum potential.\n\nHowever, the verse also points out the vulnerability of the crocodile when it leaves its familiar environment. On land, the crocodile becomes susceptible to attacks and is easily defeated by other animals. This signifies that the strength and dominance of individuals or entities could greatly diminish when they are out of their comfort zones, their familiar environments. \n\nThus, the Kural underscores the importance of understanding and leveraging one's strengths in suitable environments while also being aware of weaknesses when in unfamiliar territories. It is a reminder that circumstances and environments play a significant role in determining our success and victory, and adapting to new environments may require different skills and strategies. This verse encourages self-awareness, adaptability, and strategic positioning in life. \n\nIn a broader perspective, the verse can also be interpreted as a critique of imperialism and colonization, where powers that are dominant in their own lands may become weak and vulnerable when they venture into unfamiliar territories..The kural verse:கடலோடா கால்வல் நெடுந்தேர் கடலோடும்நாவாயும் ஓடா நிலத்து. ,translates to :Sea-going ship goes not on shore Nor on sea the strong-wheeled car,and it's explantion is :The Kural 496 emphasizes the importance of suitability and appropriateness of things in their respective situations. Just as large chariots with big wheels cannot operate in the sea, nor can ships designed for the sea traverse on land, actions and behaviors must be suitable for the situation and the context. \n\nThis verse is a metaphorical reminder that every entity, idea, or action has its own place and purpose, and forcing them into inappropriate situations will lead to ineffectiveness or failure. It suggests that one needs to understand the nature and characteristics of things before utilizing them. It also emphasizes the importance of the right fit - the right person in the right job, the right solution for the right problem, and so on. \n\nTo sum it up, Valluvar, through this verse, is teaching us the importance of context, suitability, and appropriateness in life and decision-making..The kural verse:அஞ்சாமை அல்லால் துணைவேண்டா எஞ்சாமைஎண்ணி இடத்தால் செயின். ,translates to :No aid but daring dash they need When field is chosen right for deed,and it's explantion is :Kural 497 emphasizes the importance of fearlessness, strategic planning, and choosing the right environment for any action or endeavor. It asserts that if one carefully contemplates their course of action, identifying all potential paths and outcomes without any omissions, and selects an appropriate place to execute their plans, then they need no other aid or support except for courage and fearlessness.\n\nThis Kural is essentially about the principles of strategic planning and execution. It encourages careful consideration and preparation before embarking on an endeavor, asserting that when these are complemented by fearlessness, there is no need for any external assistance.\n\nThe verse emphasizes fearlessness because it is a crucial element for success. Fear often leads to hesitation and indecision, which can severely hinder progress and achievement. Hence, cultivating an attitude of fearlessness, coupled with thorough planning and execution in the right context, can lead to successful outcomes without the need for additional support.\n\nIn a broader cultural and moral context, this verse encourages self-reliance, courage, meticulous planning, and thoughtful execution in all aspects of life, asserting that these qualities are more than enough to achieve success..The kural verse:சிறுபடையான் செல்லிடம் சேரின் உறுபடையான்ஊக்கம் அழிந்து விடும். ,translates to :Though force is small, if place is right One quells a foe of well-armed might,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural asserts the importance of strategic planning in any venture, not only in terms of warfare but also in life.\n\nThe verse states, \"The power of one who has a large army will perish if he goes into ground where only a small army can act.\" This signifies that having a large force or resources does not secure victory or success. The terrain or situation where the battle is fought (or the task is undertaken) plays a crucial role. If a large army ventures into a territory that favors a smaller army, it loses its advantage and might end up losing the battle. \n\nThis can be interpreted in a broader sense that in life, overconfidence or the blind use of power and resources without considering the situation can lead to failure. It emphasizes the need for strategic thinking, adaptability, and understanding of one's circumstances to achieve success. \n\nThe cultural context here is that it is rooted in the ancient Tamil tradition where warfare was common, and strategies played a vital role in winning battles. However, the moral lesson is timeless and applicable across various aspects of life..The kural verse:சிறைநலனும் சீரும் இலரெனினும் மாந்தர்உறைநிலத்தோடு ஒட்டல் அரிது. ,translates to :To face a foe at home is vain Though fort and status are not fine,and it's explantion is :Kural 499 emphasizes the significance of home-ground advantage in any form of conflict, especially war. The couplet suggests that even if an opponent lacks material strength or a formidable fortress, attacking them in their own territory is still a challenging task.\n\nThe rationale behind this concept is that even without obvious sources of power, individuals on their home turf have an inherent advantage. They know their land intimately, understand its strengths and weaknesses, and are likely to have the support and loyalty of the local population. This intimate knowledge and local support can often compensate for a lack of physical power or a strong fortress, making an invading force's task significantly harder.\n\nThis Kural is not just about physical warfare but can be applied to any situation involving conflict or competition, be it in business, politics, or personal matters. It serves as a reminder to not underestimate the power of local knowledge and the advantage of being on home ground, regardless of the apparent strength or weaknesses of the adversary..The kural verse:காலாழ் களரில் நரியடும் கண்ணஞ்சாவேலாள் முகத்த களிறு. ,translates to :A fox can kill a war tusker Fearless with feet in deep quagmire,and it's explantion is :Kural 500 speaks metaphorically, using the imagery of a fox and an elephant, to emphasize the importance of situational advantage and the danger of underestimating one's opponent. \n\nIn this verse, the 'elephant' symbolizes a powerful entity, be it an individual, a community, or a nation, that is formidable and seemingly invincible. The 'fox', on the other hand, stands for a seemingly harmless or inferior entity. The 'mud' here is a metaphor for difficult or unfavorable circumstances. \n\nThe verse states that even a mighty elephant, which can face and defeat any adversary on a battleground, can become vulnerable and be defeated by a fox when it is stuck in mud. This is because, in such a situation, the elephant loses its mobility and strength, and the fox can attack it without any fear.\n\nThe underlying moral of this verse is that strength and power are not absolute; they can be compromised by unfavorable conditions. Hence, one should never underestimate even a seemingly weak opponent or overestimate one's own strength. Furthermore, it also hints at the importance of adaptability and the ability to use situational advantage for success. \n\nIn a broader context, this verse can be applied to various aspects of life, including personal relationships, business, politics, and war strategy. It serves as a reminder to always stay humble, adaptable, and aware of one's surroundings, and not to take one's power or position for granted..The kural verse:அறம்பொருள் இன்பம் உயிரச்சம் நான்கின்திறந்தெரிந்து தேறப் படும். ,translates to :Pleasure, gold, fear of life Virtue- Test by these four and trust the true,and it's explantion is :The verse Kural 501 emphasizes the importance of careful selection of a minister or any individual for a significant role. The verse suggests four key characteristics to be scrutinized before assigning a person to an important role. These include - Virtue, Love for Money, Desire for Pleasure and Fear for Life.\n\nVirtue stands for moral righteousness, integrity, and ethical standards of a person. This is a crucial quality as it ensures the person will make just and fair decisions. \n\nLove for Money refers to the person's attitude towards wealth. A minister should not be solely driven by monetary gains but should be able to balance their personal desires and the welfare of the community.\n\nDesire for Pleasure refers to a person's self-indulgence and their ability to control their sensual desires. A person who is easily swayed by pleasures may not be able to focus on their responsibilities.\n\nFear for Life reflects a person's courage and ability to face danger or difficult situations. A minister should be brave and should prioritize their duty over personal safety.\n\nSo, according to this verse, a person should be judged on these four parameters before appointing them to a significant role. This ensures that the person chosen is righteous, not overly greedy, not easily swayed by sensual pleasures, and brave enough to face any circumstance. This verse, though written in the context of choosing a minister, provides a timeless guideline for selecting a right person for any leadership role..The kural verse:குடிப்பிறந்து குற்றத்தின் நீங்கி வடுப்பரியும்நாணுடையான் சுட்டே தெளிவு. ,translates to :Spotless name of noble birth Shamed of stain-that choice is worth,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural advises the ruler on the characteristics to look for when choosing an individual for a position of responsibility. The verse suggests three crucial traits. \n\nFirstly, the person should hail from a respectable family. In the cultural context of ancient India, a person's family lineage was an indicator of their upbringing and the values they had been taught. It was believed that good families instill virtues and moral principles in their children, equipping them to be effective leaders.\n\nSecondly, the individual should be free from faults or wrongdoings. This emphasizes the importance of personal integrity and moral character in a leader. A leader with a clean record would be more likely to uphold justice and fairness.\n\nLastly, the verse mentions the importance of modesty, which in this context is interpreted as a fear of committing sinful actions. A leader who fears the consequences of wrongdoings would be less likely to misuse their power for personal gain. This 'fear' is not one of cowardice but is a reflection of the individual's moral conscience.\n\nIn essence, Thiru Kural states that a ruler should choose leaders who come from good families, are free from faults, and have a strong moral conscience. These traits would ensure the chosen leader is capable, trustworthy, and would uphold the principles of justice and righteousness in their leadership..The kural verse:அரியகற்று ஆசற்றார் கண்ணும் தெரியுங்கால்இன்மை அரிதே வெளிறு. ,translates to :Though deep scholars of stainless sense Rare is freedom from ignorance,and it's explantion is :This Kural, number 503, explores the idea of human fallibility, and the persistence of ignorance despite extensive learning and moral rectitude. \n\nThe verse suggests that even those who have delved into the most complex works of knowledge, and who appear to be free from any faults, are not completely devoid of ignorance when closely examined. \n\nThe message here is twofold. Firstly, it emphasizes the vastness of knowledge and the limitation of human capacity to comprehend it entirely. No matter how much one learns, there always remains something unknown. This is a humbling reminder of our limitations, and an encouragement to remain open-minded and continue our pursuit of knowledge.\n\nSecondly, the verse highlights the importance of introspection and self-awareness. Even those who are celebrated for their knowledge and virtue may have areas of ignorance. Therefore, one should continually strive for self-improvement and never assume to know everything.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar suggests that ignorance is an inherent part of the human condition, regardless of one's level of learning or moral character. This is not a critique, but rather an encouragement to embrace the journey of learning with humility and perseverance..The kural verse:குணம்நாடிக் குற்றமும் நாடி அவற்றுள்மிகைநாடி மிக்க கொளல். ,translates to :Good and evil in man weigh well Judge him by virtues which prevail,and it's explantion is :Kural 504 emphasizes the importance of balanced judgment in leadership. A ruler, or in a broader sense, any person in a position of authority, is advised to meticulously evaluate both the virtues and vices of an individual before forming an opinion or decision about them. \n\nThis requires a comprehensive understanding of the individual's character, identifying their strengths and weaknesses, and then making a judgment based on which aspect is more dominant. The kural advises not to hastily label a person based on a single trait or action, but to give a fair chance to explore their overall character. \n\nBy doing so, the leader ensures fairness in judgment, leading to better decision-making, and maintaining trust and respect among his subjects or team. This principle of balanced judgment is not only applicable to rulers but also valuable in various life situations, like in relationships, workplaces, or social interactions. It encourages us to see people in their entirety, acknowledging both their flaws and strengths, thus promoting understanding and empathy..The kural verse:பெருமைக்கும் ஏனைச் சிறுமைக்கும் தத்தம்கருமமே கட்டளைக் கல். ,translates to :By the touchstone of deeds is seen If any one is great or mean,and it's explantion is :Kural 505 emphasizes the influence and importance of a person's actions in determining their character. It suggests that one's deeds serve as a reliable measure or touchstone for discerning their true nature, be it greatness or littleness. This analogy to a touchstone, a stone used to test the purity of gold or silver, implies that actions, like this testing process, reveal the real value or worth of a person. \n\nJust as the quality of precious metals can be determined by their reaction to a touchstone, a person's moral and ethical standards can be ascertained by observing their actions. The verse encourages individuals to pay close attention to their deeds, as they are the most visible and immediate representation of one's character. It points to the idea that actions speak louder than words, and it is through our actions that we are judged, not our intentions or words.\n\nThe moral interpretation of this verse is that both greatness and littleness are not inherently present in a person, but are outcomes of their actions. Therefore, individuals should be mindful of their actions, as they are the ultimate measure of their character..The kural verse:அற்றாரைத் தேறுதல் ஓம்புக மற்றவர்பற்றிலர் நாணார் பழி. ,translates to :Choose not those men without kinsmen Without affine or shame of sin,and it's explantion is :This verse of Thiru Kural advises rulers to exercise caution while choosing individuals for any task or position of responsibility. The verse asserts that people without any familial or social ties should not be selected, as they do not have any attachments or responsibilities towards others. Such individuals are least likely to fear the consequences of committing a crime or wrongdoing, as they do not have any loved ones to disappoint or societal reputation to maintain.\n\nIn essence, the verse emphasizes the importance of accountability and the fear of societal shame as deterrents to committing wrongful acts. People who have family and societal ties are likely to think twice before engaging in any unethical behavior, as they would not want to bring disgrace to their loved ones or society. \n\nIn a broader context, this verse is a reminder that our familial and social bonds often serve as our moral compass, guiding us to act righteously and deterring us from engaging in harmful activities. This principle holds true not just for rulers but for everyone in all walks of life..The kural verse:காதன்மை கந்தா அறிவறியார்த் தேறுதல்பேதைமை எல்லாந் தரும். ,translates to :On favour leaning fools you choose; Folly in all its forms ensues,and it's explantion is :Kural 507 emphasizes the danger of entrusting authority or positions of power to those who lack wisdom or understanding. The verse warns that such a choice, driven by affection or attachment, will not just result in ignorance, but also lead to a plethora of unwise actions and decisions.\n\nIn other words, if one lets sentimentality or affection guide their choice in selecting individuals for important roles, without considering their intellectual capabilities or level of understanding, it results in not just a single mistake, but a multitude of errors and issues. This is because the lack of wisdom or understanding in those chosen individuals will lead them to make poor decisions, resulting in chaos and damage.\n\nThis verse serves as a timeless wisdom, urging us to make decisions based on rationality and wisdom, rather than personal affection or sentimentality. It is a reminder that leadership and authority require knowledge and understanding, and these qualities should be the guiding factors when selecting individuals for such positions..The kural verse:தேரான் பிறனைத் தெளிந்தான் வழிமுறைதீரா இடும்பை தரும். ,translates to :To trust an untried stranger brings Endless troubles on all our kins,and it's explantion is :Kural 508 emphasizes the importance of careful consideration before forming alliances or partnerships. The verse warns of the enduring sorrow that may befall not just the individual, but also his lineage, if he hastily chooses to ally with a stranger without understanding their character or intentions.\n\nIn the broader context, this verse is a cautionary advice against impulsive decisions in forming relationships, be it personal, professional, or political. It underscores the need for due diligence, understanding, and mutual respect in any bond or partnership. Failure to do so can lead to distress and sorrow, not only for the individual but also for his descendants.\n\nThe verse also subtly hints at the concept of karma, suggesting that hasty and thoughtless actions can have long-lasting negative impacts, affecting not just the person responsible but also his lineage. It encourages a thoughtful and discerning approach to forming relationships and making decisions, highlighting the potential consequences of disregarding this wisdom. \n\nIn essence, Thirukural 508 implores us to be judicious in our alliances and reminds us of the lasting implications our choices can have on our lives and the lives of our future generations..The kural verse:தேறற்க யாரையும் தேராது தேர்ந்தபின்தேறுக தேறும் பொருள். ,translates to :Trust not without testing and then Find proper work for trusted men,and it's explantion is :The Kural 509 advises leaders on the careful selection of individuals for tasks and roles. It emphasizes the importance of thorough scrutiny before entrusting anyone with responsibilities. The verse suggests that leaders should not hastily assign duties to anyone without prior examination of their competence and integrity. \n\nAfter selecting an individual, based on their proven qualifications and abilities, the leader should then assign duties that are appropriate to their skills and capabilities. The verse discourages doubting the individual's abilities post-selection, implying the importance of trust in a leader-subordinate relationship. \n\nIn essence, this verse teaches the values of careful consideration, right delegation, and trust in leadership. It underscores the need for leaders to be discerning in their choices, ensuring that the selected individuals are well suited for the tasks they are entrusted with. This Kural remains highly relevant today, providing guidance for effective leadership and management..The kural verse:தேரான் தெளிவும் தெளிந்தான்கண் ஐயுறவும்தீரா இடும்பை தரும். ,translates to :Trust without test; The trusted doubt; Both entail troubles in and out,and it's explantion is :This verse speaks about the importance of discernment and trust in decision-making, especially when selecting a person for a role or responsibility. \n\nThe first half of the verse warns about the dangers of choosing someone without proper examination or understanding of their capabilities. The consequences of such impulsive decisions can lead to significant sorrow and regret, as the person chosen may not live up to the expectations or may even cause harm due to their incompetence.\n\nThe second half of the verse deals with the issue of doubting someone who has already been chosen after thorough examination. It suggests that once a person has been chosen based on a careful evaluation of their qualifications and capabilities, one should not entertain doubts about their competence or intentions. Doubting a person who has been thoroughly evaluated and chosen can lead to unnecessary distress and confusion, and may also undermine the person's confidence and performance.\n\nThus, the verse emphasizes the importance of careful evaluation before decision-making, and trust and confidence in the decisions made. It also highlights the potential harm and sorrow that can come from hasty decisions and unnecessary doubts..The kural verse:நன்மையும் தீமையும் நாடி நலம்புரிந்ததன்மையான் ஆளப் படும். ,translates to :Employ the wise who will discern The good and bad and do good turn,and it's explantion is :Kural 511 emphasizes the importance of discernment in leadership. It suggests that a king or any leader should employ individuals who have the ability to differentiate between the good and the bad. These individuals should not only have the capacity to understand the implications of their actions but also the wisdom to choose the right path after considering all possible outcomes.\n\nIn any undertaking, there are always potential benefits (good) and drawbacks (bad). The ability to weigh these outcomes carefully and choose the path that maximizes benefits while minimizing harm is a highly valued skill. It requires a deep understanding of the situation, foresight to predict possible outcomes, and the courage to make tough decisions. Those who possess this ability are most suited for leadership roles.\n\nThe verse also implies an ethical aspect. It suggests that leaders should lean towards actions that result in good, even after considering both good and bad outcomes. This highlights the moral responsibility of leaders to act in the best interest of their people.\n\nIn short, this verse encourages discernment, ethical decision-making, and the prioritization of beneficial outcomes in leadership. It advises rulers to appoint individuals with these qualities to roles of responsibility..The kural verse:வாரி பெருக்கி வளம்படுத்து உற்றவைஆராய்வான் செய்க வினை. ,translates to :Let him act who resource swells; Fosters wealth and prevents ills,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse advises on the qualities of an effective administrator or a leader, specifically a king in this context. The verse suggests that the person who should take on the responsibility of leading should be proficient in three key areas.\n\nFirstly, they should be capable of expanding the sources of income for their kingdom. This means being innovative and strategic in identifying and cultivating new avenues for revenue generation. This could involve engaging in profitable trade, encouraging economic activities, or implementing policies that promote financial growth.\n\nSecondly, the leader should be able to increase the wealth of the kingdom. Besides just generating revenue, they should have the ability to manage and multiply the wealth effectively. This might involve smart investments, prudent spending, and ensuring the wealth is used in a way that benefits the kingdom as a whole.\n\nLastly, the leader should have the foresight and wisdom to foresee potential mishaps or threats that could harm the kingdom's wealth and take preventive measures to avert them. This includes being vigilant about potential enemies, natural calamities, or economic downturns and having contingency plans to handle these situations.\n\nIn summary, this verse suggests that a leader should have the ability to expand revenue sources, increase wealth, and prevent potential threats to safeguard the kingdom's prosperity. These qualities make a leader competent and effective in their role..The kural verse:அன்பறிவு தேற்றம் அவாவின்மை இந்நான்கும்நன்குடையான் கட்டே தெளிவு. ,translates to :Trust him in whom these four you see: Love, wit, non-craving, clarity,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural emphasizes the qualities that an ideal ruler or leader should possess. The four attributes mentioned are love, knowledge, a clear mind, and freedom from covetousness.\n\n\"Love\" in this context refers to the benevolence and compassion that a leader should have towards his subjects or team. This love should be impartial, extending to all, irrespective of their status or position.\n\n\"Knowledge\" refers to the wisdom and understanding a leader must have. It encompasses not just academic or professional knowledge, but also the deeper understanding of people, society, and the natural order of things.\n\nA \"clear mind\" is about the ability to make sound decisions. The leader should not be clouded by emotions, prejudice, or personal bias. He should be able to analyze situations objectively and make decisions that are in the best interest of all.\n\n\"Freedom from covetousness\" highlights the importance of integrity and lack of greed. An ideal leader should not be driven by personal gain or avarice. He should be selfless, working for the welfare of his subjects or team, not for personal enrichment.\n\nIn essence, this Kural suggests that the ideal leader is one who combines compassion, wisdom, clarity of thought, and integrity. Such a leader is well-equipped to guide his people effectively and justly..The kural verse:எனைவகையான் தேறியக் கண்ணும் வினைவகையான்வேறாகும் மாந்தர் பலர். ,translates to :Though tried and found fit, yet we see Many differ before duty,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse refers to the unpredictability of human behavior, especially when given responsibilities or positions of power. Even when a leader has meticulously evaluated and observed individuals, there are always some who change in character and performance when they are entrusted with tasks or duties. This change can sometimes be for the worse, and they may not live up to the expectations that were placed upon them.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the need for leaders to be vigilant and adaptable, as individuals' behavior may vary based on the nature of the work they are assigned. It also serves as a warning that not all who seem capable initially will prove to be so in the long run, and leaders must be prepared to handle such situations. \n\nUltimately, the verse imparts the wisdom that human nature is complex and can be influenced by circumstances and responsibilities. It encourages leaders to exercise caution and discretion when assigning roles and responsibilities..The kural verse:அறிந்தாற்றிச் செய்கிற்பாற்கு அல்லால் வினைதான்சிறந்தானென்று ஏவற்பாற் றன்று. ,translates to :Wise able men with power invest Not by fondness but by hard test,and it's explantion is :The Kural 515 emphasizes the importance of wisdom and patience in leadership and decision-making, particularly in the context of a monarchy. According to the Kural, a king's work should only be entrusted to a person who has the wisdom to understand the intricacies of the task and the patience to endure any obstacles that may arise during its execution. The verse advises against assigning tasks based on personal affection or favoritism. \n\nThis Kural implies that the success of a task heavily depends on the abilities of the person performing it. Handing over responsibilities to an incapable person, solely based on personal affection or favoritism, can lead to failure and mishaps. In a broader perspective, this Kural advises us to make decisions based on rationality and merit, rather than emotions or personal relationships.\n\nIn essence, the Kural teaches us that in governance, as well as in life, wisdom, patience, and merit should be the guiding principles in decision-making, rather than personal attachments or favoritism. It reminds us that it is not just about getting the job done, but getting it done right, by the right person..The kural verse:செய்வானை நாடி வினைநாடிக் காலத்தோடுஎய்த உணர்ந்து செயல். ,translates to :Discern the agent and the deed And just in proper time proceed,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse 516 emphasizes the importance of strategic decision-making, especially in leadership roles. It suggests that before executing any task, three crucial aspects need to be thoroughly considered - the executor, the task itself, and the timing. \n\nFirstly, the 'executor' refers to the person who is assigned to carry out the task. The leader should evaluate the individual's capabilities, strengths, experiences, and weaknesses to ensure the person is competent enough for the job at hand. \n\nSecondly, the 'task' itself needs to be scrutinized. The leader should understand the intricacies of the task, its requirements, potential challenges, and the expected outcomes. This will enable the leader to provide clear instructions and resources necessary for the task's successful completion.\n\nLastly, 'timing' is a key factor. Every task has an appropriate time for it to be initiated and completed. This could be influenced by various factors like the urgency of the task, external circumstances or market conditions (in case of business decisions), etc. The leader should be able to discern the right time to start the task to ensure its effectiveness and success.\n\nIn summary, this verse advises that one should execute an action only after careful consideration of the executor's abilities, the nature of the task, and the suitable timing. This not only increases the chances of success but also ensures efficient and effective management..The kural verse:இதனை இதனால் இவன்முடிக்கும் என்றாய்ந்துஅதனை அவன்கண் விடல். ,translates to :This work, by this, this man can do Like this entrust the duty due,and it's explantion is :This verse of Thiru Kural advises on the importance of delegation in the context of leadership, particularly for a king or ruler. The essence of the verse is that a leader should thoroughly analyze a task and evaluate who is best suited to accomplish it, considering their skills, resources, and capabilities. Once convinced that a certain individual can perform the task efficiently, the leader should delegate the responsibility to them.\n\nThis Kural emphasizes the importance of task allocation and delegation in management. It guides that a successful leader should not only understand the nature of the task but also the capabilities of his people. By delegating tasks to those best equipped to handle them, leaders ensure that the work is done efficiently and effectively.\n\nThe verse also underscores the leader's role in empowering their subordinates, granting them the trust and autonomy to carry out assigned tasks. This approach not only ensures effective completion of tasks but also fosters a sense of responsibility and ownership among the subordinates, thereby enhancing their competence and confidence.\n\nIn summary, the Kural's wisdom is that effective leadership involves the judicious delegation of tasks, based on a careful assessment of both the task and the individual's ability to execute it. This principle holds true not just for kings or rulers, but for leaders in any realm, be it business, politics, or social organizations..The kural verse:வினைக்குரிமை நாடிய பின்றை அவனைஅதற்குரிய னாகச் செயல். ,translates to :His fitness for the duty scan Leave him to do the best he can,and it's explantion is :The Kural 518 emphasizes the importance of assigning the right person to the right job. It advises the king, or by extension any leader, to carefully evaluate an individual's skills, abilities, and suitability for a particular task or role before employing them. The essence of this verse is the principle of 'Right Person for the Right Job'. \n\nThis verse underscores the importance of understanding a person's strengths and aptitudes, and assigning them tasks that match their abilities. This will not only make the person more productive and efficient but also leads to job satisfaction, resulting in the overall growth and prosperity of the kingdom or organization. \n\nThe wisdom of this verse is as relevant today as it was when it was written. In today's context, this could apply to leaders in any field, be it business, education, or government, who should always strive to place individuals where their talents would be most effectively used. \n\nIn essence, the verse propagates the importance of role-fitment and leveraging individual's capabilities to the fullest for the collective benefit and progress. It is a timeless principle that is fundamental to human resource management and leadership..The kural verse:வினைக்கண் வினையுடையான் கேண்மைவே றாகநினைப்பானை நீங்கும் திரு. ,translates to :Who do duty for duty's sake Doubt them; and fortune departs quick,and it's explantion is :Kural 519 emphasizes the importance of trust in any relationship, particularly in the context of a king and his dutiful subjects or officials. It states that prosperity will abandon a ruler who unjustly doubts the loyalty of a person who is diligently fulfilling his duties.\n\nThis verse illustrates the concept that mistrust in a trustworthy person can lead to one's downfall. When a person is consistently working hard and fulfilling his responsibilities, doubting his loyalty or intentions can be counterproductive and damaging. In the case of a king, this could lead to the loss of a valuable asset, potential discord within the kingdom, and eventually, a decline in prosperity.\n\nThe Kural warns leaders, or anyone in a position of authority, to be judicious in their judgement of others' loyalty and commitment. Misplaced suspicion can lead not only to the loss of valuable allies, but also to the overall well-being and prosperity of the kingdom or organization.\n\nFurthermore, this verse underscores the value of trust in a successful leadership. It highlights that a good leader should be able to discern, trust, and value his diligent and committed subjects, as their contribution is essential for the prosperity and success of his reign. \n\nIn conclusion, Kural 519 teaches the detrimental consequences of unwarranted suspicion and emphasizes the critical role of trust in maintaining a prosperous and harmonious rule..The kural verse:நாடோறும் நாடுக மன்னன் வினைசெய்வான்கோடாமை கோடா துலகு. ,translates to :Worker straight the world is straight The king must look to this aright,and it's explantion is :Kural 520 emphasizes the crucial role of a ruler in ensuring the well-being and righteous conduct of his subjects. It asserts that the moral and ethical behavior of the people is directly influenced by the actions of their leader. \n\nThe verse suggests that the king or any leader must consistently supervise and monitor the conduct of his subordinates or subjects. By doing so, he ensures that they do not indulge in any dishonest or unethical activities. The clear implication is that when those in power lead by example and maintain a disciplined, virtuous system, it encourages the same behavior among the masses.\n\nThis Kural underscores the idea that a leader's actions have a cascading effect on society. If the leader is upright, so will be his subjects; if the leader is corrupt or neglectful, the society will inevitably reflect the same. It is a profound reminder to those in power of their responsibility towards their subjects and the larger society, emphasizing the need for vigilance, fairness, and moral integrity. \n\nIn essence, the verse is a call for leaders to lead with integrity and maintain a constant vigil on their administration, as this directly influences the harmony and justice of the world they govern..The kural verse:பற்றற்ற கண்ணும் பழைமைபா ராட்டுதல்சுற்றத்தார் கண்ணே உள. ,translates to :Let fortunes go; yet kinsmen know The old accustomed love to show,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse speaks about the enduring nature of true kinship, which remains unaltered even in the face of hardships and poverty. The verse implies that those who continue to treat a person with the same respect and affection, notwithstanding his losses and destitution, are his real relatives.\n\nIn the verse, Valluvar uses the notion of 'property all gone' as a metaphor for the worst possible situation a person can be in. This represents not just material loss but also the loss of social standing, respect, and dignity that usually accompanies financial ruin. Yet, there are those who stand by such a person, treating him with the same kindness and respect as before. These individuals are the 'relatives' Valluvar refers to - not necessarily blood relatives, but those who are bound by ties of love, respect, and kindness.\n\nThe verse stresses the importance of unconditional love and respect in relationships. It suggests that the true measure of a relationship is not how it fares in times of prosperity, but how it stands in times of adversity. True relatives are those who support and respect you, regardless of your socio-economic status.\n\nThis message is timeless and universal, holding relevance even in today's materialistic world. It reminds us to value people for their inherent worth, rather than their possessions or social standing..The kural verse:விருப்பறாச் சுற்றம் இயையின் அருப்பறாஆக்கம் பலவும் தரும். ,translates to :The gift of loving Kins bestows  Fadeless fortune's fresh flowers,and it's explantion is :Kural 522 emphasizes the importance of a loving and supportive family or social circle. It suggests that if a person's relatives or close ones maintain a constant and unwavering affection towards him, it becomes a fountain of ever-increasing wealth.\n\nThe term wealth here refers not just to material riches, but also to emotional wealth, moral support, guidance, and shared knowledge. In times of difficulty, this supportive network acts as a safety net, providing strength and resilience.\n\nFurthermore, the verse highlights the power of love and unity in a person's life. When a person is surrounded by a loving family and friends, their life becomes richer in many aspects - emotionally, socially, and even materially. Their overall wellbeing improves, their resilience strengthens, and they are likely to be more successful in their endeavors.\n\nThe verse also underlines the importance of being a loving and dependable family member or friend. It encourages individuals to be supportive and loving, as such relationships are a source of wealth and prosperity in life. \n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse can be interpreted as a call for harmony and unity in society. It emphasizes that a society where individuals support and care for each other is a prosperous and successful one..The kural verse:அளவளா வில்லாதான் வாழ்க்கை குளவளாக்கோடின்றி நீர்நிறைந் தற்று. ,translates to :A kinless wealth is like a tank Which overflows without a bank,and it's explantion is :Kural 523 emphasizes the value of familial and societal bonds in an individual's life. This Kural compares the life of a person who doesn't mingle freely with their relatives to a pond that is filled to the brim without any banks. \n\nIn the Tamil culture, familial and societal connections are considered a vital part of life. They not only provide material assistance but also emotional and moral support. The lack of these connections is seen as a downside, similar to a water body without banks. \n\nJust as water in a pond without banks is useless as it cannot be utilized effectively for irrigation or other purposes, the life of a person who doesn't maintain good relationships with their kin is also seen as futile. Their wealth and life lack meaningful purpose and are not beneficial to themselves or others.\n\nThis verse is a call for maintaining healthy relationships with family and community, suggesting that wealth and life acquire true meaning and purpose only when shared and enjoyed with others..The kural verse:சுற்றத்தால் சுற்றப் படஒழுகல் செல்வந்தான்பெற்றத்தால் பெற்ற பயன். ,translates to :The fruit of growing wealth is gained When kith and kin are happy found,and it's explantion is :Kural 524 emphasizes the true value of wealth. It posits that the real benefit of accumulating wealth is not for personal luxury or extravagance, but rather to live in harmony and mutual support with one's relatives and loved ones. \n\nThe verse indicates that wealth should serve as a tool to foster and maintain good relationships within one's family and community. It suggests that wealth has little worth if it doesn't contribute to a harmonious family life or if it isolates the wealthy individual from their relatives. \n\nSo, the essence of this Kural is about the social utility of wealth. It underscores the idea that wealth's real value lies in its capacity to facilitate a harmonious and supportive environment with one's kin, rather than in materialistic indulgence. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can also be perceived as a moral commentary on how one's wealth should be used wisely and responsibly, for the well-being and prosperity of not just oneself, but also one's family and community..The kural verse:கொடுத்தலும் இன்சொலும் ஆற்றின் அடுக்கியசுற்றத்தால் சுற்றப் படும். ,translates to :Loving words and liberal hand Encircle kith and kin around,and it's explantion is :Kural 525 speaks about the power of generosity and affability. These two virtues, when genuinely manifested in a person, have the ability to attract and amass a large number of relatives, friends, and well-wishers around him. \n\nThe first part of the verse, \"கொடுத்தலும் இன்சொலும் ஆற்றின்\" refers to the qualities of generosity and affability. Generosity here refers to the act of giving and sharing one's resources selflessly with others without expecting anything in return. Affability, on the other hand, refers to the ability to speak kindly and pleasantly to others, making them feel comfortable and valued.\n\nThe second part of the verse, \"அடுக்கிய சுற்றத்தால் சுற்றப் படும்\", highlights the outcome of possessing these virtues. When a person practices generosity and speaks kindly, he naturally attracts people towards him. He will be surrounded by an abundance of relatives and well-wishers, who appreciate and reciprocate his benevolence and kindness.\n\nIn essence, this Kural emphasizes the power of positive behavior and how it can attract a supportive community around an individual. It serves as a reminder that our actions and words have the power to shape our social environment and relationships..The kural verse:பெருங்கொடையான் பேணான் வெகுளி அவனின்மருங்குடையார் மாநிலத்து இல். ,translates to :Large giver and wrathless man Commands on earth countless kinsmen,and it's explantion is :Kural 526 delves into the traits of generosity and anger management as the pinnacles of popularity and acceptance in society.\n\nThe verse suggests that a person who is generous, particularly one who gives large gifts, earns the affection and respect of others. This generosity is not merely about materials or wealth, but also encompasses kindness, empathy, and help in times of need. Such a person becomes a magnet for others, attracting an ever-expanding circle of well-wishers, friends, and relatives.\n\nAlongside generosity, the verse also emphasizes the importance of controlling one's anger. A person who refrains from anger, who is patient, tolerant, and understanding, is appreciated and loved. The ability to manage anger indicates emotional maturity and a balanced mind. It fosters harmonious relationships and creates an environment of peace and goodwill.\n\nThus, the verse asserts that a person who embodies both these qualities - generosity and absence of anger - is unparalleled in the world. Such a person will have the most extensive circle of relatives and well-wishers, not by blood relation, but by virtue of their love and respect for him. In essence, the adage underscores the profound impact of our character and behavior on our social relationships..The kural verse:காக்கை கரவா கரைந்துண்ணும் ஆக்கமும்அன்னநீ ரார்க்கே உள. ,translates to :The crows hide not; thy call and eat Welfare abides a man of heart,and it's explantion is :Kural 527 emphasizes the virtue of sharing and generosity, using the behavior of crows as a metaphor. Crows are known to call out to their own kind when they find food, inviting them to share the meal instead of hoarding it for themselves. The principle here is straightforward: just as crows share their food with others, people who willingly share their wealth and resources with their kin and community will be the ones to enjoy prosperity.\n\nThis verse underscores the importance of generosity and community spirit in Tamil culture. It suggests that those who hoard or hide their wealth will not truly prosper. The true measure of wealth, according to this verse, is not in the accumulation of resources, but in the willingness to share them. By equating generosity with prosperity, Valluvar emphasizes that wealth should be used for the benefit of others, particularly one's relatives and community. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse encourages us to cultivate a spirit of giving, suggesting that altruism is not just a moral virtue, but also a path to personal growth and prosperity. The sharing spirit of the crows serves as a reminder that we are part of a larger community, and our actions should reflect this interconnectedness..The kural verse:பொதுநோக்கான் வேந்தன் வரிசையா நோக்கின்அதுநோக்கி வாழ்வார் பலர். ,translates to :From public gaze when kings perceive Each one's merits so many thrive,and it's explantion is :The Kural 528 emphasizes the importance of discernment and meritocracy in leadership. The verse suggests that a ruler should not treat everyone in a similar manner, but rather should recognize and appreciate each individual according to their unique abilities and merits. \n\nThe first line, \"பொதுநோக்கான் வேந்தன் வரிசையா\" implies that a king, or any leader, should not look at everyone in a generalized or common manner. There should be a system or order (varisai) based on individual capabilities and contributions.\n\nThe second line, \"நோக்கின் அதுநோக்கி வாழ்வார் பலர்\", suggests that when such a discerning approach is practiced, many individuals will appreciate it, embrace it, and choose to live under the leadership that values meritocracy. This not only motivates individuals to perform at their best but also fosters a sense of fairness and justice, which are key to maintaining harmony in any society or kingdom.\n\nIn essence, this Kural advises leaders to be discerning, to appreciate individual strengths, and to allocate roles and responsibilities based on merit rather than on general assumptions or favoritism. Such practice will attract more people to live under their leadership and contribute to the well-being of the society or kingdom..The kural verse:தமராகிக் தற்றுறந்தார் சுற்றம் அமராமைக்காரணம் இன்றி வரும். ,translates to :Forsaken friends will come and stay When cause for discord goes away,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural speaks about the dynamics of human relationships and the importance of personal character. It suggests that when friends part ways due to a certain disagreement or misunderstanding, they will return if they realize that the cause of the problem did not lie in the person they left.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse underlines the significance of personal integrity and fairness. It implies that if a person maintains his or her character, rectifies mistakes, and ensures that they are not the cause for discord, then people who have left will eventually return. It acknowledges the human tendency to gravitate towards those who are fair, just, and devoid of the flaws that once caused dissatisfaction.\n\nThe verse also highlights a crucial aspect of conflict resolution - the elimination of the cause of the disagreement. Once the cause is removed or rectified, there is room for reconciliation and the rebuilding of relationships. \n\nIn essence, this verse carries a profound lesson on the power of character, the value of self-improvement, and the possibility of reconciliation in human relationships. It encourages individuals to reflect on their actions, correct their mistakes, and maintain relationships by ensuring that they are not the cause of disharmony..The kural verse:உழைப்பிரிந்து காரணத்தின் வந்தானை வேந்தன்இழைத் திருந்து எண்ணிக் கொளல். ,translates to :Who leaves and returns with motive The king should test him and receive,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes on the virtue of forgiveness and insightful understanding in leadership. The poet, Thiruvalluvar, speaks directly to the rulers, advising them on how to handle a situation when a person who had once left them comes back due to certain reasons.\n\nThe verse suggests that if a person leaves the king or leader and then returns due to some reason, the king should not hastily reject or condemn him. Instead, the king should thoughtfully understand the reason for his return and try fulfilling his objectives. The idea here is to understand that people may have their reasons to leave, but if they return, it means they acknowledge the value of the leader or the establishment they left behind.\n\nThis verse also hints at the importance of second chances and advises leaders to be open-minded and patient, not impulsive or rigid. It reinforces the idea that leadership is not about exercising power, but about understanding, empathy, forgiveness and providing guidance and support to those governed.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar advocates for a wise and compassionate approach in leadership, one that values relationships and understands human fallibilities. This timeless advice is relevant not just for political leaders, but for anyone in a position of authority or influence..The kural verse:இறந்த வெகுளியின் தீதே சிறந்தஉவகை மகிழ்ச்சியிற் சோர்வு. ,translates to :Worse than wrath in excess is Forgetfulness in joy-excess,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse, 531, discusses the pitfalls of excess joy leading to forgetfulness and how it can be more harmful than uncontrolled anger. The poet, Thiruvalluvar, warns against the intoxication of extreme happiness, which can make one forget their duties, responsibilities, and even morals.\n\nThe verse underlines that while uncontrolled anger can lead to regrettable actions, the harm it causes is comparatively less than the damage caused by the forgetfulness that springs from excessive joy. This latter form of harm is insidious, as it can lead to the neglect of important actions or responsibilities, and the erosion of one's character and values. \n\nIn other words, Thiruvalluvar cautions us to moderate our emotions, both positive and negative. While it's important to experience joy, we should not let it cloud our judgement or make us negligent. Similarly, while anger is a natural emotion, we should strive to control it, to prevent it from leading to harmful actions.\n\nThis verse is a profound reminder of the virtues of balance and moderation in all aspects of life, as extremes of any emotion can lead to undesirable consequences..The kural verse:பொச்சாப்புக் கொல்லும் புகழை அறிவினைநிச்ச நிரப்புக் கொன் றாங்கு. ,translates to :Negligence kills renown just as Ceaseless want wisdom destroys,and it's explantion is :Kural 532 focuses on two integral aspects of human life: fame and knowledge. It warns of the destructive power of forgetfulness and constant poverty on these aspects, respectively.\n\n\"Forgetfulness will destroy fame, even as constant poverty destroys knowledge\" - the verse essentially compares the detrimental effects of forgetfulness and chronic poverty. Forgetfulness, in this context, does not merely refer to a lapse in memory, but a failure to uphold and remember one's duties, principles, and commitments. It suggests that when people forget their responsibilities or deviate from their path, it tarnishes their reputation, diminishing their fame.\n\nSimilarly, the verse highlights the adverse impact of ongoing poverty on knowledge. It underscores that without the necessary resources and stability, the pursuit and preservation of knowledge become challenging. As poverty strips away opportunities for learning and intellectual growth, it gradually depletes one's knowledge.\n\nThe Kural, thus, emphasizes the importance of memory in maintaining prestige and the necessity of financial stability in fostering knowledge. This reminder is as much an observation on the human condition as it is a moral guideline, urging individuals to stay committed to their responsibilities and strive for financial stability to nurture their intellect..The kural verse:பொச்சாப்பார்க் கில்லை புகழ்மை அதுஉலகத்துஎப்பால்நூ லோர்க்கும் துணிவு. ,translates to :Forgetful nature fails of fame All schools of thinkers say the same,and it's explantion is :Kural 533 emphasizes the importance of mindfulness and thoughtfulness in achieving fame and respect. According to this verse, those who are thoughtless or careless will never achieve fame. This principle is universally accepted, and it resonates across all scholarly treatises around the world.\n\nThe verse underscores the value of being attentive, thoughtful, and diligent in our actions, as it is these qualities that lead to respect and recognition. Conversely, a lack of thought or care in our actions leads to a lack of respect and recognition, a principle that is universally agreed upon across cultures and literatures.\n\nIn essence, the verse encourages us to cultivate mindfulness and attentiveness in all we do, as these traits are not only virtues in themselves, but also the path to earning respect and renown. Without these qualities, one's actions are unlikely to be recognized or celebrated, a notion that is universally acknowledged across various domains of knowledge and wisdom..The kural verse:அச்ச முடையார்க்கு அரணில்லை ஆங்கில்லைபொச்சாப் புடையார்க்கு நன்கு. ,translates to :The fearful find no fortress here The forgetful find good never,and it's explantion is :Kural 534 emphasizes the importance of courage and mindfulness in life. According to this verse, a coward, despite being surrounded by protective fortifications, lacks the real defense - courage. External protection or security measures cannot compensate for the internal fear that a coward experiences. Similarly, a person with thoughtlessness or heedlessness, regardless of the advantages they may have, lacks true benefit. Even if they enjoy privileges or high status, without mindfulness and conscious awareness, they are unable to utilize these advantages for their good or the good of others. The verse underlines the idea that the real strength and benefit come from within – from courage and mindfulness, rather than from external circumstances or advantages..The kural verse:முன்னுறக் காவாது இழுக்கியான் தன்பிழைபின்னூறு இரங்கி விடும். ,translates to :Failing foresight the guardless man Shall rue his folly later on,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural underlines the importance of foresight and preparedness in life. It suggests that a person who fails to anticipate potential issues and take necessary precautions will inevitably face regret and sorrow when difficulties arise.\n\nThe verse is a reminder to us that while we cannot always predict what the future holds, we can certainly prepare for the likelihood of challenges. It emphasizes the importance of preventive action over reactive measures. A person who neglects to prepare for possible calamities, due to thoughtlessness or negligence, will find themselves in a state of regret and despair when adversity strikes.\n\nIn a broader view, this verse advises us to be proactive and strategic in our approach to life, to think ahead, and to safeguard our interests and well-being by considering potential risks and making necessary arrangements to mitigate them. It teaches us that foresight, prudence, and preparation are key to avoiding unnecessary distress and regret in life.\n\nIn essence, this verse advises us to be mindful and prepared for the future, to avoid the regret that comes with unpreparedness. It emphasizes the value of foresight, planning, and preventive action in leading a fulfilled and regret-free life..The kural verse:இழுக்காமை யார்மாட்டும் என்றும் வழுக்காமைவாயின் அதுவொப்பது இல். ,translates to :Forget none; watch with wakeful care Miss none; the gain is sans compare,and it's explantion is :Kural 536 emphasizes the virtue of unfailing mindfulness or thoughtfulness towards all individuals, at all times. This verse extols the merit of having a constant and unwavering attentiveness, implying a sense of care, concern, and understanding towards others. It is a trait that involves not forgetting or neglecting one's duties, responsibilities, and interactions with others. \n\nThe verse asserts that there is no virtue that can match this quality of unfailing mindfulness. This could be interpreted as a call for empathy, understanding, and respect towards all, regardless of their status or relationship to oneself. It stresses the importance of being consistently thoughtful and considerate, which in turn can help build strong, respectful relationships and a harmonious society.\n\nIt's essentially about the power of being present, attentive, and thoughtful in all our interactions with others. It encourages us to be aware of and considerate towards the feelings, needs, and circumstances of others, always. It goes beyond mere politeness or courtesy; it's about genuine empathy, understanding, and respect. It's about being present in our interactions with others, not just physically, but emotionally and mentally as well. It's about seeing others not just as they appear to us, but as they truly are, with their own unique experiences, perspectives, and feelings.\n\nIn summary, the verse underlines the importance of consistent mindfulness and thoughtfulness in all our dealings with others. It suggests that such an approach can lead to a more harmonious and respectful society..The kural verse:அரியஎன்று ஆகாத இல்லைபொச் சாவாக்கருவியால் போற்றிச் செயின். ,translates to :With cautious care pursue a thing Impossible there is nothing,and it's explantion is :The Thiru Kural verse 537 emphasizes the immense power of human will and diligent effort. It conveys that there is no task or ambition that is too hard to achieve if pursued with unwavering determination and careful planning. \n\nThe verse highlights two primary elements for success. The first is conscientious effort, suggesting that success comes from not just working hard, but working smart, with careful planning and thoughtful execution. The second is persistence, represented by the term 'unflinching endeavour'. It implies that one must not give up or waver in the face of adversity or challenges.\n\nMoreover, the verse very subtly conveys the importance of having a strong mental resolve (signified by the term 'with no forgetfulness' in the Tamil explanation). It suggests that remembering one's goals and staying focused on them is crucial in achieving success.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse encourages us to believe in our capabilities and stresses that with the right approach and steadfast determination, we can overcome any obstacle and achieve our goals, irrespective of how difficult they might seem..The kural verse:புகழ்ந்தவை போற்றிச் செயல்வேண்டும் செய்யாதுஇகழ்ந்தார்க்கு எழுமையும் இல். ,translates to :Do what the wise commend as worth If not, for seven births no mirth,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural emphasizes the importance of upholding virtues that have been extolled by the wise. It encourages individuals to consciously observe and execute actions that are widely praised for their moral and ethical worth.\n\nThe verse points out that the neglect of these commendable actions can lead to a lack of prosperity, not only in the current life but across the cycle of seven births, a concept prevalent in Hindu philosophy which believes in reincarnation. The number seven is used here symbolically to indicate a long duration or endless cycle.\n\nIn essence, the verse underscores the principle of Karma, where one's actions in the present directly impact their future, not only within this life but also in the successive lives to come. It advocates for the pursuit of praiseworthy deeds that contribute to personal growth, societal well-being, and spiritual elevation.\n\nThe wise and learned individuals are often seen as moral compasses in society, and their commendations typically include values like truthfulness, righteousness, kindness, and selflessness. The verse thus promotes the idea of learning from these individuals and incorporating their wisdom into one's own life..The kural verse:இகழ்ச்சியின் கெட்டாரை உள்ளுக தாந்தம்மகிழ்ச்சியின் மைந்துறும் போழ்து. ,translates to :When joy deludes, their fate recall Whom negligence has made to fall,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural advises leaders (specifically kings, but the advice is applicable to any person in a position of power) to recall those who have been ruined due to negligence at times when they themselves are elated with joy. The reason behind this advice is to instill a sense of humility and caution in them. \n\nIn the throes of joy or success, it's easy for a leader to get carried away and neglect their responsibilities. This verse serves as a reminder that such negligence can lead to ruin, as it has for those before them. It is a call for mindful leadership, emphasizing that a leader should not let joy or success cloud their judgment or let them stray from their duties.\n\nIn essence, the verse encourages leaders to learn from the failures of the past and remain grounded, even in moments of great joy or success. This ensures they remain effective in their roles and don't fall into the same traps as those who have come before them. \n\nThe underlying moral is a universal one: that power comes with responsibility, and that we should never allow our personal emotions or successes to interfere with the duties we owe to others..The kural verse:உள்ளியது எய்தல் எளிதுமன் மற்றுந்தான்உள்ளியது உள்ளப் பெறின். ,translates to :Easy it is a thing to get When the mind on it is set,and it's explantion is :Verse 540 of Thirukkural emphasizes the power of persistent thought and determination for the attainment of one's goals. It suggests that when a person continuously thinks about a certain objective, it becomes easier for them to achieve it.\n\nThis verse underscores the importance of unwavering focus and determination. When we set a goal and constantly think about it, it becomes a part of our subconscious mind. This persistent thought process guides our actions towards achieving the goal, making it easier to attain. \n\nMoreover, this verse also subtly hints at the power of visualization and affirmation in our lives. It suggests that by repeatedly thinking and visualizing our objectives, we can manifest them into reality. \n\nIn a broader perspective, this Kural encourages us to have a clear vision, maintain steady focus, and be persistent in our efforts. With these qualities, it becomes easier to achieve our goals and aspirations.\n\nRemember, the power of our thoughts is immense. They shape our actions, our actions determine our habits, and our habits define our destiny. So, think positively, remain focused, and success will surely follow..The kural verse:ஓர்ந்துகண் ணோடாது இறைபுரிந்து யார்மாட்டும்தேர்ந்துசெய் வஃதே முறை. ,translates to :Test and attest impartially Consult and act the laws justly,and it's explantion is :Kural 541 emphasizes the principles that should govern a fair and just administration of justice.

It suggests that the authority should strive to act impartially towards all individuals involved, regardless of their status or relationship with the authority. Once the facts are established, the authority should then impose a wisely chosen punishment that fits the crime.\n\nThis verse encapsulates the essence of a just legal system- one that is unbiased, impartial, and judicious. It highlights the importance of fairness, impartiality, and wisdom in the administration of justice, principles that are universally acclaimed in any civilized society. \n\nIn essence, this verse teaches us that justice should be served with an unbiased mind and a balanced approach, ensuring that the punishment is appropriate and just..The kural verse:வானோக்கி வாழும் உலகெல்லாம் மன்னவன்கோல் நோக்கி வாழுங் குடி. ,translates to :The earth looks up to sky and thrives And mankind to king's rod of justice,and it's explantion is :Kural 542 illustrates the parallel between the importance of rain for life on Earth and a just king for the prosperity of his kingdom. \n\nJust as all life forms depend on rain for their survival, the wellbeing of the subjects of a kingdom is dependent on the fairness and justice of their ruler. Rain, when it falls, nourishes the Earth and sustains all living beings. Similarly, a just ruler creates an environment where his subjects can thrive. He ensures that justice prevails, protecting his people from unfairness and oppression.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the significance of good governance, likening it to a life-giving phenomenon like rain. It suggests that just as nature has a responsibility to provide rain for the sustenance of life, the king has a responsibility to rule with justice for the welfare of his people.\n\nThus, for a kingdom to prosper, it requires a ruler who governs with fairness, just as the Earth needs rain to nurture all forms of life..The kural verse:அந்தணர் நூற்கும் அறத்திற்கும் ஆதியாய்நின்றது மன்னவன் கோல். ,translates to :The Sage's scripture and virtue spring From the sceptre of a stately king,and it's explantion is :The verse 543 of Thiru Kural emphasizes the critical role of a just and righteous ruler in upholding the principles of the scriptures (referred to as Vedas) and all the virtues they prescribe. The scepter of the king symbolizes the authority and power of the ruler. The verse suggests that this power, when used righteously, forms the foundation for the preservation and propagation of the spiritual scriptures and the ethical codes they enshrine. \n\nIn the broader cultural context, this verse underscores the interdependence between political power and moral order. It implies that a stable, effective, and virtuous governance system is necessary to uphold and implement the teachings of the scriptures and to maintain the moral fabric of society. \n\nTherefore, the verse communicates an essential aspect of social ethics, that the rulers or leaders of society have a profound responsibility in safeguarding and promoting moral virtues and principles among their subjects. The king's scepter is not merely a tool of authority but a symbol of duty and responsibility to uphold righteousness and virtue..The kural verse:குடிதழீஇக் கோலோச்சும் மாநில மன்னன்அடிதழீஇ நிற்கும் உலகு. ,translates to :The world clings to the ruler's feet Whose sceptre clasps the people's heart,and it's explantion is :Kural 544 emphasizes the importance of benevolent leadership.

Such a leader's influence extends beyond his kingdom's boundaries, and he will be remembered and respected globally.

The verse metaphorically highlights that a king who rules with justice and fairness brings about an environment conducive to both abundant rainfall and plentiful harvests.\n\nThe 'rain' and 'plentiful crops' symbolize prosperity and abundance, while the 'king who sways his sceptre with justice' represents a fair and just ruler. The verse suggests that when a king rules with integrity and justice, he creates a harmonious society where nature also responds positively, resulting in sufficient rain and bountiful crops.\n\nIn essence, it means that a just ruler's governance ensures the well-being and prosperity of his people, reflecting in all aspects of life, including the natural environment.

It states that victory does not come from the might of the spear or the javelin, i.e., military might or use of force. Instead, it comes from the king's sceptre, which represents his authority and his rule. But this rule should not be unjust or cruel. \n\nIn other words, it implies that a king or ruler achieves true victory not through violence or brute force, but through just and fair governance. When a king rules with justice, fairness, and without any bias or partiality, he earns the respect, love, and loyalty of his people. This, in turn, strengthens his rule and brings him true victory.\n\nSo, this verse highlights the importance of moral values, fairness, and justice in leadership and governance. It emphasizes that true power lies in fairness and justice, not in force or violence. The verse also underscores the responsibility that comes with power and authority, urging leaders to use their power wisely and justly..The kural verse:இறைகாக்கும் வையகம் எல்லாம் அவனைமுறைகாக்கும் முட்டாச் செயின். ,translates to :The king protects the entire earth And justice protects his royal worth,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the fundamental role of justice in governance. It states that a king or ruler is entrusted with the responsibility of protecting and governing the entire world. However, the verse further elaborates that the king himself is safeguarded by his adherence to justice. \n\nThe verse underscores that when the king administers justice flawlessly, without any bias or favoritism, it creates a protective shield around him. This shield is not of soldiers or weapons, but of respect, trust, and loyalty from his subjects. It is this incorruptible commitment to justice that ensures the stability of his rule and the sustained prosperity of his kingdom.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can be applied to any leadership role, not just a king, emphasizing the importance of fairness, integrity, and justice in leadership. This timeless principle holds relevance even in today's world, where leaders are expected to uphold justice and fairness in their governance. It highlights that the strength of a leader is not in the power they wield, but in the justice they uphold. \n\nThe verse is a reminder that power should not be used for personal gain but should be exercised in a fair and just manner to ensure the well-being of all.

It warns that a ruler who does not provide easy access to his subjects, and does not listen, analyze, and pass fair judgments on their grievances, is bound to decline and perish in disgrace.\n\nThis verse highlights two critical responsibilities of a ruler. First, it stresses the need for the ruler to be approachable, signifying the importance of communication between the ruler and the ruled. It discourages the practice of maintaining a distance and suggests that a ruler should be open to hear the concerns of his subjects.\n\nSecond, it emphasizes the importance of justice. The ruler has a duty to impartially evaluate the issues brought before him and dispense justice accordingly. Neglecting this duty can lead to discontent and unrest among the subjects, thereby leading to the downfall of the ruler.\n\nIn essence, this verse suggests that good governance is not just about ruling, but also about serving the people by being accessible and delivering justice. Failure to do so can result in the ruler's own collapse and loss of dignity..The kural verse:குடிபுறங் காத்தோம்பிக் குற்றம் கடிதல்வடுவன்று வேந்தன் தொழில். ,translates to :Save his subjects and chide the wrong Is flawless duty of a king,and it's explantion is :The Kural 549 emphasizes the primary duties of a ruler. It explains that a king's foremost responsibilities are to protect his subjects from harm by others, as well as by himself, and to administer impartial justice by punishing those who commit wrong, regardless of their status or relationship to him. \n\nIn the first part, \"guarding his subjects (against injury from others)\" refers to the king's duty to ensure external security from invaders or enemies. It also includes internal safety from harmful elements within his kingdom. The second part, \"preserving them himself\" implies the king's responsibility to not cause harm to his subjects through his actions or policies. \n\nThe verse further underscores that a king should punish crime without any prejudice. No individual, irrespective of their stature or proximity to the king, should be spared if they commit a crime. This idea promotes fairness and impartiality in justice.\n\nIn essence, this verse suggests that a truly effective and just king is one who safeguards his subjects, causes no harm to them and maintains a just legal system, treating all his subjects equally before the law..The kural verse:கொலையிற் கொடியாரை வேந்தொறுத்தல் பைங்கூழ்களைகட் டதனொடு நேர். ,translates to :Killing killers, the king, behold Weeds removes from cropful field,and it's explantion is :Kural 550 emphasizes the role of a ruler or king in punishing the wicked or criminal elements in society. The verse uses the analogy of a farmer pulling out weeds from a field of green crops. Just as weeds hinder the growth of crops, criminals disrupt the harmony and progress of society. \n\nThe removal of weeds is essential for the healthy growth of crops. Similarly, punishing criminals is crucial for maintaining peace, law, and order within a kingdom or society. By doing so, the ruler protects the innocent and ensures the overall well-being of his subjects. \n\nThe verse stresses the fact that it is not merely a king's prerogative but his duty to administer justice. The forceful action against the wicked is seen as a necessary step, akin to the farmer's activity, whose end goal is an abundant and healthy harvest. The king's ultimate aim is to foster a society where justice prevails and the citizens live in peace and prosperity..The kural verse:கொலைமேற்கொண் டாரிற் கொடிதே அலைமேற்கொண்டுஅல்லவை செய்தொழுகும் வேந்து. ,translates to :The unjust tyrant oppressor  Is worse than cruel murderer,and it's explantion is :Kural 551 presents a sharp critique of rulers who act unjustly towards their subjects, leading them into oppression and suffering. It argues that such rulers, who wield immense power and yet misuse it to cause harm, are more dangerous and cruel than common murderers.\n\nThe verse metaphorically compares the oppressive ruler to a murderer, suggesting that while the murderer takes individual lives, the oppressive ruler kills the spirit and livelihood of an entire population. The comparison serves to highlight the gravity of the ruler's actions, as they have the potential to affect a much larger number of people.\n\nThe kural underscores the moral responsibility that comes with power. It suggests that those in positions of authority, such as rulers, have a duty to use their power to serve and protect their subjects, rather than exploit and oppress them. Failure to do so, the kural suggests, is a grave moral transgression, even worse than murder.\n\nThis verse also reflects the ethical values of Thiruvalluvar, who places great importance on justice, righteousness, and benevolent leadership. It serves as a warning to current and future leaders, reminding them of the potential harm they can cause if they fail to uphold these values..The kural verse:வேலொடு நின்றான் இடுவென் றதுபோலும்கோலொடு நின்றான் இரவு. ,translates to :Sceptered tyrant exacting gold Is \\\"give\\\" of lanced robber bold,and it's explantion is :Kural 552 criticizes rulers who misuse their power to exploit their subjects, comparing them to highway robbers. The sceptre, or the stick held by the ruler, is a symbol of authority. When the ruler, wielding this scepter, demands money or resources unfairly from their subjects, it is likened to a highway robber who stands with a weapon, intimidating travelers to surrender their wealth. This kural emphasizes the moral responsibility of those in power, reminding them that misuse of authority is equivalent to common thievery. It implies that the authority given to rulers is meant for the welfare of the people, not for personal gain or exploitation. The kural, thus, promotes ethical governance and condemns corruption..The kural verse:நாடொறும் நாடி முறைசெய்யா மன்னவன்நாடொறும் நாடு கெடும். ,translates to :Spy wrongs daily and do justice Or day by day the realm decays,and it's explantion is :Kural 553 emphasizes on the importance of a just and fair rule in the prosperity of a kingdom. The verse states that a king who does not routinely examine and rectify the injustices and wrongs committed in his kingdom, will eventually lead his nation to ruin. \n\nThe verse brings to light the essential role of a king (or any leader) as the pillar of justice and rectitude in his realm. An effective ruler, according to Thiruvalluvar, does not simply preside over his kingdom, but actively investigates the issues and conflicts within his jurisdiction. He then dispenses justice accordingly, ensuring fairness and peace among his subjects.\n\nThis kural emphasizes the principle of accountability in leadership. The king is portrayed as the ultimate guardian of his people’s rights and welfare. If he fails to fulfill this duty, the verse warns, his kingdom will inevitably decline and fall into ruin. The verse suggests a gradual, but relentless, decay - a consequence that unfolds 'daily,' as a result of the king's persistent neglect of his responsibilities.\n\nIn a broader context, this kural can be applied to modern governance and leadership, advocating for transparency, justice, and active problem-solving. Leaders, whether in politics, business, or any field, are encouraged to regularly evaluate their performance and rectify any issues, to maintain the health and prosperity of their respective domains.\n\nIn essence, Kural 553 upholds the principle of active and just leadership, warning against the dire consequences of neglect and injustice..The kural verse:கூழுங் குடியும் ஒருங்கிழக்கும் கோல்கோடிச்சூழாது செய்யும் அரசு. ,translates to :The king shall wealth and subjects lose If his sceptre he dares abuse,and it's explantion is :Kural 554 addresses the significance of adhering to justice in leadership. The verse warns against the consequences of acting unjustly or without proper consideration of the repercussions. \n\nAccording to this verse, a ruler who acts unjustly or makes hasty decisions without reflecting on the potential adverse consequences will lose both his wealth and the allegiance of his subjects. This loss is not just material but also symbolic, representing the loss of respect, trust, and loyalty - the core elements that hold a kingdom together.\n\nThe Kural highlights here the moral responsibility a leader holds in upholding justice and making wise decisions. It emphasizes that a leader's actions directly impact the well-being and prosperity of his people and his kingdom. Therefore, a leader should act with fairness, integrity, and foresight to sustain his rule and maintain the respect and loyalty of his people.\n\nThis verse is a timeless reminder of the effects of leadership on the prosperity and integrity of a community, be it a small group or a large nation. It underscores the importance of ethical leadership and the dire consequences of negligence and corruption..The kural verse:அல்லற்பட்டு ஆற்றாது அழுதகண் ணீரன்றேசெல்வத்தைத் தேய்க்கும் படை ,translates to :Groaning tears caused by tyrant's sway  File the royal wealth away,and it's explantion is :The Kural 555 emphasizes the consequences of a ruler's oppressive rule. It metaphorically states that the tears shed by the people, who are unable to tolerate the harshness and cruelty of their leader, can act as a weapon powerful enough to destroy his wealth and prosperity.\n\nThis verse underlines the importance of a just and empathetic rule. If a ruler is unjust and imposes unbearable suffering on his subjects, their pain and tears will eventually lead to his downfall. The tears are metaphorically referred to as a 'saw', indicating their potential to slowly but steadily erode the ruler's wealth, power, and prosperity.\n\nIn essence, this verse serves as a reminder to those in power about the impact of their actions on their subjects. If they rule with cruelty and oppression, the resultant suffering of their people will eventually lead to their own destruction. This moral lesson is not just applicable to rulers, but also to anyone in a position of power or authority..The kural verse:மன்னர்க்கு மன்னுதல் செங்கோன்மை அஃதின்றேல்மன்னாவாம் மன்னர்க் கொளி. ,translates to :Glory endures by sceptre right Without it wanes the royal light,and it's explantion is :This Kural (verse) 556 emphasizes the importance of righteous governance for the enduring fame of a ruler. Thiruvalluvar, the poet, suggests that the key to a king's enduring reputation and fame lies in their adherence to justice and righteousness. The virtue of 'Sengol', in Tamil, refers to a scepter, a symbol of righteous rule and justice. Thus, it metaphorically stands for the king's righteous governance. \n\nIn essence, the verse affirms that a ruler's fame and legacy are not built by their power or wealth, but by their commitment to justice, fairness, and the welfare of their subjects. If such righteousness is absent in their rule, their fame would be fleeting and impermanent. This verse, thus, underscores the moral responsibility of those in power, reminding them that their legacy depends on their ethical conduct and fair administration. \n\nIn a broader perspective, it is relevant to all forms of leadership, advising them that true respect and lasting reputation come from integrity, fairness, and consideration for those they lead..The kural verse:துளியின்மை ஞாலத்திற்கு எற்றற்றே வேந்தன்அளியின்மை வாழும் உயிர்க்கு. ,translates to :Dry like the earth without rainfall Is graceless king to creatures all,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse likens the absence of kindness in a ruler to a world without rain. Just as rain nourishes the earth and sustains life, kindness in a ruler cultivates prosperity and harmony among the people. \n\nThe verse asserts that when a king is devoid of compassion, it is as detrimental to the people as a drought is to the world. It brings hardship, suffering, and despair, just like the absence of rainfall can lead to drought, famine, and death. \n\nIn essence, the verse emphasizes the importance of empathy and benevolence in leadership. Just as rain is vital for the survival and well-being of all living things, kindness in rulership is essential for the welfare and progress of the people. It underscores the idea that a ruler's kindness is not just a virtue, but a necessity for the overall well-being of the society he governs. \n\nThe cultural context here refers to the traditional Indian belief in an ideal king (or ruler) as a father figure, who is expected to take care of his subjects with kindness and compassion, just like a parent would. An unkind and uncaring ruler is considered as catastrophic as a severe drought..The kural verse:இன்மையின் இன்னாது உடைமை முறைசெய்யாமன்னவன் கோற்கீழ்ப் படின். ,translates to :To have is worse than having not If ruler is unjust despot,and it's explantion is :Kural 558 emphasizes the importance of justice in leadership, particularly in the context of kingship. The verse suggests that living under the rule of a king who lacks fairness and justice is a source of greater sorrow than living in poverty. This is because, in such a society, wealth and property might become a source of misery, as they could be unjustly seized or exploited by the unjust ruler. \n\nThe verse essentially highlights the significance of justice and fair rule in governance. It underlines that the well-being of the subjects is not solely determined by their material wealth, but significantly influenced by the fairness, integrity, and justice of their ruler. A just ruler can make even a life of poverty bearable, while an unjust ruler can turn wealth into a source of anxiety and suffering. \n\nIn broader terms, the verse could be interpreted as a critique of any form of leadership or governance that lacks justice, suggesting that such an environment can turn even the most prosperous situations into sources of distress. Therefore, it underscores the importance of justice, fairness, and ethical leadership in creating a society where wealth and prosperity can truly benefit its members..The kural verse:முறைகோடி மன்னவன் செய்யின் உறைகோடிஒல்லாது வானம் பெயல். ,translates to :The sky withdraws season's shower If the king misuses his power,and it's explantion is :Kural 559 emphasizes the moral responsibility of the ruler or king towards maintaining justice in his realm. The verse metaphorically correlates the king's unjust actions with the natural imbalance, specifically referring to irregular rainfall or the withholding of rain altogether.\n\nIn ancient belief systems, particularly in Eastern philosophies, the natural world and human society were often seen as interconnected. It was believed that the actions of humans, especially those in power, could influence the natural elements. Thiruvalluvar, in this verse, alludes to this concept, asserting that a king's injustice could disrupt the harmony of nature, causing rainfall to become erratic or cease.\n\nThe verse is a powerful reminder to rulers and people in positions of power that their actions have far-reaching consequences. If a king fails to uphold justice, it isn't just the human societal order that suffers; even nature loses its balance. It signifies the importance of righteous leadership for the overall well-being of a kingdom or country, including its natural environment.\n\nThe verse is also a metaphorical warning that unprincipled governance can lead to the downfall of a society, marked by disruptions in essential elements like rainfall, which was critical for agriculture, the primary source of livelihood in ancient times. Thus, the Kural advocates for ethical leadership, linking it to the prosperity and survival of the society and the natural world..The kural verse:ஆபயன் குன்றும் அறுதொழிலோர் நூல்மறப்பர்காவலன் காவான் எனின். ,translates to :The *six-functioned forget their lore Cows give less if kings guard no more * the six functions are: learning, teaching,  giving,  getting, sacrificing, kindling sacrifice These are duties of Vedic savants,and it's explantion is :Kural 560 emphasizes the importance of a vigilant leadership in maintaining the prosperity and cultural wealth of a country. The verse metaphorically uses the 'produce of the cows' and 'Brahmins forgetting the Vedas' to illustrate the degradation of material and spiritual wealth, respectively.\n\nThe 'produce of the cows' refers to the wealth and prosperity of the land. In agricultural societies like ancient Tamil Nadu, cows were significant for their milk and their role in farming. Hence, their well-being was directly proportional to the prosperity of the land. If the guardian or the ruler neglects his duty, this prosperity declines.\n\nThe phrase 'Brahmins will forget the Vedas' refers to the spiritual and intellectual wealth of the society. Brahmins, who were the custodians of knowledge and spirituality, forgetting the Vedas, implies the decay of intellectual wisdom and moral values due to the lack of protection and support from the leadership.\n\nIn essence, the verse illustrates that a negligent ruler can lead to the downfall of both material wealth and spiritual wisdom in a society. Therefore, a leader must be vigilant and proactive in safeguarding the interests of his people, ensuring both their physical prosperity and intellectual growth..The kural verse:தக்காங்கு நாடித் தலைச்செல்லா வண்ணத்தால்ஒத்தாங்கு ஒறுப்பது வேந்து. ,translates to :A king enquires and gives sentence  Just to prevent future offence,and it's explantion is :The verse 561 of Thiru Kural emphasizes the role of a king (or a leader) in maintaining justice in his kingdom (or in his field of influence). The verse states that a king should scrutinize any reported injustice or wrongdoings impartially without any bias. After thorough examination, he should administer an appropriate punishment that would deter the wrongdoer from repeating the offense.\n\nThe verse not only discusses the role of the king, but also highlights the importance of a fair and just judicial system. It implies that punishment should not just be a form of retribution, but also a deterrent to prevent the recurrence of the crime. The verse also underscores the responsibility of a leader to maintain order and stability in society.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can also be applied to current leadership roles in various fields such as politics, business, and education. Leaders are expected to handle their responsibilities impartially and ensure that any wrongdoing is appropriately addressed and discouraged.\n\nIn conclusion, this verse is about the need for leaders to be fair and just, and to ensure that their decisions deter the repetition of wrong deeds. This is the essential duty of a king or a leader, according to Thirukkural..The kural verse:கடிதோச்சி மெல்ல எறிக நெடிதாக்கம்நீங்காமை வேண்டு பவர். ,translates to :Wield fast the rod but gently lay This strict mildness prolongs the sway,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural emphasizes the importance of balanced judgement and justice in leadership. \n\nThe verse advises that a king, or any leader, who wishes for long-term stability and prosperity in their realm, should approach issues with a stern yet fair mindset. It suggests that initial inquiries into any matter should be conducted with strict scrutiny, ensuring that all aspects are closely and carefully examined. This strictness in the preliminary stages serves as a deterrent, discouraging misbehavior or wrongdoings. \n\nHowever, when it comes to the execution of punishment or consequences, the leader should exhibit leniency and moderation. The punishment should not be excessive or unreasonably harsh, but should match the severity of the offence committed. This approach ensures that justice is served without breeding resentment or fear among the people.\n\nIn essence, this kural highlights the importance of a balanced approach to governance, recommending strictness in investigation and moderation in punishment, to ensure long-lasting prosperity and harmony in the kingdom..The kural verse:வெருவந்த செய்தொழுகும் வெங்கோல னாயின்ஒருவந்தம் ஒல்லைக் கெடும். ,translates to :His cruel rod of dreadful deed Brings king's ruin quick indeed,and it's explantion is :Kural 563 speaks about the flaws of autocratic leadership and the consequences of ruling by instilling fear in the hearts of the subjects. It says that a ruler who governs with a cruel hand, causing his people to live in fear, is sure to face a speedy downfall.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of benevolent leadership. A ruler's power and authority should not be used to intimidate or oppress the subjects, but rather to protect and guide them. Fear-based governance not only alienates the ruler from his subjects but also creates a fragile and unstable state that is destined for ruin.\n\nThe core message of the verse is the ethical conduct of power - it serves as a cautionary tale for leaders to exercise their power with kindness, respect, and understanding, rather than employing it as a tool for terror and oppression. The verse aligns with the universal principle that those who misuse power or rule with cruelty are bound to face a swift and inevitable downfall..The kural verse:இறைகடியன் என்றுரைக்கும் இன்னாச்சொல் வேந்தன்உறைகடுகி ஒல்லைக் கெடும். ,translates to :As men the king a tyrant call  His days dwindled, hasten his fall,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse, Kural 564, conveys that a ruler who is known for his cruelty will lose his power and prosperity quickly. His reign will be short-lived as his harshness will only lead to his downfall.\n\nThe verse highlights the importance of justice and benevolence in leadership. When a leader is cruel, he earns the resentment and scorn of his subjects. This negative image, denoted by the term 'cruel', is a mark of a leader's failure to fulfill his responsibilities towards his people with fairness and compassion.\n\nThe phrase 'his life becoming shortened' does not necessarily imply a physical shortening of the ruler's life. Instead, it symbolizes the rapid decline of his power, status, and influence. This is because the ruler's authority is not based on fear or oppression, but on the respect and loyalty of his subjects, which can only be earned through just governance.\n\nIn a wider sense, this verse also serves as a reminder that one's actions have consequences, and those who choose cruelty and oppression over kindness and justice will face their downfall sooner or later. It's a timeless message that rings true across different eras, cultures, and societies, emphasizing the universal values of justice, compassion, and good governance..The kural verse:அருஞ்செவ்வி இன்னா முகத்தான் பெருஞ்செல்வம்பேஎய்கண் டன்னது உடைத்து. ,translates to :Whose sight is scarce, whose face is foul His wealth seems watched by a ghoul,and it's explantion is :Kural 565 emphasizes the futility of wealth possessed by an individual who is inaccessible and carries an unwelcoming demeanor. The verse metaphorically compares such wealth to that gained by a devil, which is seen as a source of fear and dread. \n\nThis verse presents a moral lesson highlighting the importance of approachability and kindness. Wealth, no matter how immense, loses its value if the person holding it is unapproachable or carries a stern and harsh countenance. Such wealth might as well have been possessed by a devil (a being that most people fear and avoid) because it brings no joy or benefit to others. \n\nThe verse implies that wealth should be used for the betterment of society and should make the possessor more approachable and kinder. If it leads to the person becoming more aloof and stern, the wealth is not serving its purpose and is, in essence, a source of fear and dread, much like something a devil would possess.\n\nSo, the essence of this verse is about the correct usage of wealth and the behavior of the person possessing it. Wealth should make us more human, kind, and accessible, not turn us into beings that people fear and avoid..The kural verse:கடுஞ்சொல்லன் கண்ணிலன் ஆயின் நெடுஞ்செல்வம்நீடின்றி ஆங்கே கெடும். ,translates to :Whose word is harsh, whose sight is rude His wealth and power quickly fade,and it's explantion is :Kural 566 emphasizes the importance of kindness and gentle speech for a ruler or a person of power. The verse suggests that if a king or a leader uses harsh words and lacks compassion in his actions or looks, his wealth and prosperity will not last.\n\nThis interpretation is drawn from the belief that wealth and power are not just material but are also influenced by moral and ethical behavior. Harshness and lack of compassion are considered negative traits that can lead to the downfall of even the most prosperous.\n\nThe verse advises leaders to be kind and gentle in their words and actions. It implies that wealth and prosperity are not just about accumulating riches, but also about how one treats others. If a king is harsh and unkind, his wealth will perish quickly instead of lasting. The leader's character and behavior towards his subjects play a significant role in the longevity and stability of his reign.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can apply to anyone in a position of power or influence, not just kings. It emphasizes the importance of good character and kindness in leadership and wealth management. It suggests that people who are harsh and unkind may find their wealth and influence diminishing rather than enduring..The kural verse:கடுமொழியும் கையிகந்த தண்டமும் வேந்தன்அடுமுரண் தேய்க்கும் அரம். ,translates to :Reproofs rough and punishments rude Like files conquering power corrode,and it's explantion is :Kural 567 asserts the importance of balanced speech and fair punishment in a ruler’s conduct. It cautions that harsh words and disproportionate punishments can act as a detriment to the ruler's authority and can erode their strength. \n\nThe verse implies that a ruler's power is not merely physical but also moral. The strength of a king or any leader is not just in their ability to destroy their enemies, but also in their ability to win the hearts of their people. When a ruler uses severe words or metes out excessive punishments, they essentially weaken their own moral standing, thereby reducing their power and influence.\n\nThis verse underscores a timeless principle of leadership – that respect is not earned through fear or oppression, but through fairness, justice, and effective communication. A leader who fails to recognize this risks diminishing their own power and ability to lead effectively.\n\nIn a broader sense, this Kural emphasizes the values of empathy, understanding, and fair judgment in all aspects of life, not just in leadership. It serves as a reminder that our words and actions have consequences, and that harshness and cruelty can ultimately weaken our relationships and standing in society..The kural verse:இனத்தாற்றி எண்ணாத வேந்தன் சினத்தாற்றிச்சீறிற் சிறுகும் திரு. ,translates to :The king who would not take counsels Rages with wrath-his fortune fails,and it's explantion is :Kural 568 provides a critical insight into the nature of leadership and management of affairs. It warns against the perils of a king or a leader who delegates responsibilities to his ministers without any personal reflection or understanding of the matters at hand. It also cautions against the leader's tendency to respond with anger and blame towards his ministers when things go wrong.\n\nEssentially, this verse emphasizes the importance of active participation and understanding in leadership. A king or a leader should not blindly entrust everything to his ministers. He should actively engage in discussions, understand the intricacies of the tasks, and make decisions based on careful thought and reflection. \n\nMoreover, when things don't go as planned, the leader should not react with anger and blame his ministers. Such behavior not only creates a negative environment but also undermines the trust and relationship between the leader and his team.\n\nInstead, a wise leader should take responsibility for the failures, learn from them, and strive to make better decisions in the future. Leadership is not just about delegating tasks and holding others accountable, but it's also about self-accountability, understanding, and thoughtful decision-making.\n\nFailure to adhere to these principles can lead to a decline in the prosperity of the kingdom, as indicated by the verse. It suggests that thoughtless and angry leadership can lead to the downfall of a king's reign. It's a timeless reminder that successful leadership requires wisdom, patience, and active participation..The kural verse:செருவந்த போழ்திற் சிறைசெய்யா வேந்தன்வெருவந்து வெய்து கெடும். ,translates to :The king who builds not fort betimes Fears his foes in wars and dies,and it's explantion is :The Kural 569 emphasizes the importance of preparedness and foresight in leadership, particularly in times of conflict and unrest. This verse uses the metaphor of a king and a fortress to convey its message.\n\nThe verse states that a king who has not prepared his defenses well in advance will become gripped with fear and perish quickly when a war arises. In this context, the \"king\" can be seen as any leader or individual in a position of authority, and the \"fortress\" represents the protective measures or strategies that one should have in place to deal with potential threats and challenges.\n\nThe verse underscores the significance of strategic planning and readiness. Just as a king must fortify his kingdom to withstand potential attacks, leaders must anticipate potential difficulties and challenges and prepare their strategies accordingly. If they fail to do so, they may find themselves overwhelmed and defeated when adversity strikes.\n\nThe verse also gives a broader message about the importance of being prepared in life. It encourages individuals to think ahead, anticipate potential challenges, and build their personal and professional defenses accordingly. When we are prepared, we can face challenges with confidence and courage, instead of fear and panic.\n\nIn summary, Thiru Kural 569 emphasizes the value of foresight, preparedness, and strategic planning in leadership and life, reminding us that those who fail to prepare are essentially preparing to fail..The kural verse:கல்லார்ப் பிணிக்கும் கடுங்கோல் அதுவல்லதுஇல்லை நிலக்குப் பொறை. ,translates to :The crushing burden borne by earth Is tyrants bound to fools uncouth,and it's explantion is :Kural 570 delves into the negative impact of an oppressive regime that operates with the support of ignorant individuals. It suggests that there is no greater burden to the earth than a harsh and cruel rulership which employs uneducated or ignorant men to carry out its misdeeds.\n\nIn this verse, Thiruvalluvar uses the metaphor of a 'cruel sceptre' to refer to an oppressive regime or a tyrannical ruler. The 'ignorant men' whom this sceptre attaches to itself are those who, due to their lack of knowledge or wisdom, become the instruments of tyranny, aiding and abetting the oppressive system in its unfair practices.\n\nThe poet states that the weight of such a system is the heaviest burden that the earth has to bear. This statement underscores the grave harm that such a setup can cause to societies and the world at large. It is not just the physical burden, but also the moral and ethical toll that such a system takes on the earth and its inhabitants.\n\nThe verse is a strong indictment of autocratic leadership and emphasizes the importance of enlightened and moral governance. It also highlights the significance of education and wisdom in preventing one from becoming a tool in the hands of oppressive powers..The kural verse:கண்ணோட்டம் என்னும் கழிபெருங் காரிகைஉண்மையான் உண்டிவ் வுலகு. ,translates to :Living in the world implies The bounteous dame of benign eyes,and it's explantion is :Kural 571 emphasizes the importance of a \"gracious demeanor\", which in the original Tamil verse, is referred to as \"Kannottam\". This term can be translated as a kind, compassionate, and welcoming glance or demeanor. The verse states that it is this gracious demeanor, a valuable attribute of leaders and individuals alike, that upholds the world. \n\nThe verse suggests that the survival and prosperity of the world are contingent on the presence of individuals possessing this noble quality. It elevates \"Kannottam\" to a higher pedestal, terming it the \"greatest ornament\" one can possess. \n\nIn the broader context, this verse encourages individuals to cultivate a warm, compassionate, and welcoming demeanor. It advocates for kindness, empathy, and understanding as the cornerstones of a harmonious society and a better world.\n\nIn essence, Kural 571 underscores the power of benevolence and kindness, asserting that it is these qualities that prevent the world from descending into chaos and destruction. It serves as a reminder that a gracious demeanor is more than just a personal virtue; it's a social necessity and a driving force that sustains the world..The kural verse:கண்ணோட்டத் துள்ளது உலகியல் அஃதிலார்உண்மை நிலக்குப் பொறை. ,translates to :World lives by looks of lovely worth Who lack them are burdens of earth,and it's explantion is :Kural 572 emphasizes the importance of compassion and benevolence in the world. The term \"Kannottam\" in this verse refers to the act of looking at others with kindness and empathy. According to Thiruvalluvar, the prosperity and harmony of the world largely depend on this act of empathetic viewing. \n\nThe verse asserts that those who look at the world with compassion contribute positively to the world's wellbeing and progress. Their existence is valuable as they enhance the quality of life for others and promote a sense of unity and mutual respect among people.\n\nOn the contrary, those who lack this quality of compassion and empathy are considered a burden to the Earth. Their existence, rather than adding value to the world, makes it a more challenging place. This is because they are likely to act out of self-interest, disregarding the needs and feelings of others, thereby disrupting the harmony and balance of society.\n\nTherefore, this verse is a profound call for empathy and compassion, suggesting that these qualities are essential for a peaceful and prosperous world.\n\nIn the context of the original Tamil explanations, they all emphasize the same key message: the individuals who lack compassion and empathy are considered a burden, not contributing to the overall welfare of society. Therefore, cultivating and exhibiting kindness towards others is not just a personal virtue, but a societal responsibility..The kural verse:பண்என்னாம் பாடற்கு இயைபின்றேல் கண்என்னாம்கண்ணோட்டம் இல்லாத கண். ,translates to :Of tuneless song what is the use? Without gracious looks what are eyes?,and it's explantion is :The Kural 573 emphasizes the importance of harmony and kindness, using the metaphors of music and sight. \n\nThe first part of the Kural refers to song and harmony. Just as a song loses its beauty and purpose when it is not in harmony or lacks melody, so do actions lose their value when they are not in alignment with righteousness and morality. The song here symbolizes our actions and deeds, while harmony represents the moral and ethical principles that should guide these deeds. \n\nThe second part of the Kural talks about eyes and kindliness. It questions the purpose of eyes if they lack kindness. The eyes here symbolize our perception or viewpoint towards others. If our perception lacks kindness and empathy, it holds no true value. Just as eyes are meant to see, they should also be instruments of kindness, spreading warmth and understanding. \n\nIn essence, this Kural emphasizes that harmony in actions and kindness in perception are essential for a meaningful and virtuous life. Without these, our deeds and viewpoints are as useless as a song without melody or eyes without the ability to show kindness..The kural verse:உளபோல் முகத்தெவன் செய்யும் அளவினால்கண்ணோட்டம் இல்லாத கண். ,translates to :Except that they are on the face  What for are eyes sans measured grace,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse talks about the significance of kindness and compassion, qualities that should be inherent in the eyes of a person. The eyes are not just for physical sight but are also the windows to one's soul, reflecting their inner feelings and emotions. \n\nThe verse questions the purpose of eyes that lack a \"well-regulated kindness\", implying that eyes without empathy and compassion are of no good. It suggests that the real value of one's sight is not just in the physical vision but in the ability to perceive, understand and empathize with the pain, struggle, and emotions of others. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse emphasizes the importance of empathy and compassion in human interactions. It challenges the readers to cultivate these qualities in themselves, thus enriching their interactions and relationships with others. \n\nIn the cultural context, this verse aligns with the fundamental teachings of Thirukkural which advocate for compassion, kindness, and empathy as essential human virtues. It encourages humans to transcend beyond their physical senses and nurture their emotional intelligence. \n\nIn conclusion, the verse suggests that eyes without kindness and empathy are futile. The real value of sight lies not just in seeing the physical world but in understanding and empathizing with the emotional world of others..The kural verse:கண்ணிற்கு அணிகலம் கண்ணோட்டம் அஃதின்றேல்புண்ணென்று உணரப் படும் ,translates to :Kind looks are jewels for eyes to wear Without them they are felt as sore,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 575, from the Thirukkural, emphasizes the importance of empathy and compassion as reflected in one's gaze. The \"ornaments of the eyes\" here metaphorically refer to the expressions of kindness, warmth, and understanding that one's eyes can convey. \n\nIn essence, the verse suggests that the true value of the eyes lies not in their physical aspect, but in their ability to express and communicate kindness and empathy towards others. If the eyes lack this virtue of expressing compassion, they are considered no more than two sores, devoid of their true purpose. This metaphor of eyes being labeled as sores if devoid of kindness underscores the significance the poet attaches to empathy and compassion.\n\nThe eyes, according to the poet, are not just organs of sight, but powerful tools of communication that can reflect the inner state of a person. If that inner state is devoid of kindness, then the eyes, regardless of their physical health or beauty, are seen as unappealing or even diseased. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse illustrates the high importance that Thirukkural places on empathy and kindness, suggesting that these virtues are not just desirable, but essential to being considered truly human..The kural verse:மண்ணோ டியைந்த மரத்தனையர் கண்ணோடியைந்துகண் ணோடா தவர். ,translates to :Like trees on inert earth they grow Who don't eye to eye kindness show,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural speaks about the importance of empathy and compassion in human interactions. The poet, Thiruvalluvar, uses a metaphor comparing people who lack kindness despite having the ability to see, to trees. \n\nTrees, while being a part of nature and rooted to the earth, do not have the capacity to perceive or understand the needs and feelings of others. They exist, grow, and function, but do not interact with their surroundings in a compassionate way. Similarly, humans who possess the gift of sight, but do not use it to recognise the needs and emotions of others, are likened to these trees. \n\nThe verse underlines that having the ability to see is not merely about physical vision, but also about emotional perception. It is about using one's sight to perceive the suffering, joy, needs, and emotions of others and respond with kindness and compassion. \n\nBy equating people who lack compassion to trees, Thiruvalluvar is highlighting the importance of empathy in human relationships. He is suggesting that without kindness and compassion, humans are no better than inanimate objects that merely exist without engaging meaningfully with their surroundings. This verse serves as a reminder to use our abilities not just for our personal gain, but to contribute positively to the lives of others..The kural verse:கண்ணோட்டம் இல்லவர் கண்ணிலர் கண்ணுடையார்கண்ணோட்டம் இன்மையும் இல். ,translates to :Ungracious men lack real eyes Men of real eyes show benign grace,and it's explantion is :Kural 577 emphasizes the importance of empathy, compassion, and kindness in human interactions. The verse metaphorically equates \"eyes\" with the ability to offer kind and compassionate looks, stating that those who lack this kindness are effectively blind. In other words, the capacity to see physically does not hold much value unless it is combined with the ability to perceive with kindness and compassion. \n\nThis kural suggests that true sight is not merely about physical vision but also about emotional understanding and empathy. If one's eyes don't radiate kindness or compassion, it's as if they don't have eyes at all. Conversely, those who truly \"have eyes\" are never devoid of kind looks. They make use of their sight to bring warmth, understanding, and compassion to their interactions with others. \n\nIn essence, the verse underlines a profound moral teaching: the true function of the eyes is not just to see the physical world but to understand the emotional world and respond with kindness and empathy..The kural verse:கருமம் சிதையாமல் கண்ணோட வல்லார்க்குஉரிமை உடைத்திவ் வுலகு. ,translates to :Who gracious are but dutiful Have right for this earth beautiful,and it's explantion is :Kural 578 emphasizes the importance of both competence and compassion in leadership. It suggests that the world rightfully belongs to those leaders who are capable of performing their duties efficiently, without causing harm, and while also exhibiting kindness and empathy.\n\nIn the context of a king (or any leader), it is their responsibility to administer justice and govern their kingdom (or sphere of influence). However, this Kural suggests that it's not just about efficiency and effectiveness in their role. It's also about the way they carry out their duties. They should act without causing injury or harm, and they should do so with a sense of kindness and consideration. \n\nIn essence, it is a call for leaders to balance firmness and fairness, to be just without being harsh, and to deliver their responsibilities with a sense of empathy and kindness. Such leaders, according to Thiruvalluvar, truly have the right to rule the world. This verse is not only applicable for monarchs or political leaders, but also for anyone in a position of power or influence, including heads of families, business leaders, and administrators..The kural verse:ஒறுத்தாற்றும் பண்பினார் கண்ணும்கண் ணோடிப்பொறுத்தாற்றும் பண்பே தலை. ,translates to :To be benign and bear with foes Who vex us is true virtue's phase,and it's explantion is :The Thiru Kural verse 579 emphasizes the virtue of patience and forgiveness, even in the face of adversity or harm caused by others. It suggests that the highest form of ethical behavior is to respond to those who wish to harm us, not with retaliation, but with kindness and forbearance. \n\nThis verse encourages the reader to bear patiently with those who may cause grief or harm, showing them kindness instead of anger or revenge. It suggests that such an attitude is the pinnacle of moral excellence, as it requires great strength of character to maintain patience and kindness in the face of adversity. \n\nThe cultural context of this verse is rooted in the ancient Tamil philosophy that advocates for non-violence and compassion towards all beings. It aligns with the broader philosophical and spiritual framework advocated by Thiruvalluvar, which champions love, patience, and non-retaliation as the highest virtues. \n\nIn essence, this verse is a call for magnanimity and forgiveness. It encourages us to rise above our natural instincts of retaliation when wronged, and instead, respond with patience and kindness, making us better individuals in the process..The kural verse:பெயக்கண்டும் நஞ்சுண் டமைவர் நயத்தக்கநாகரிகம் வேண்டு பவர். ,translates to :Men of graceful courtesy Take hemlock and look cheerfully,and it's explantion is :Kural 580 explores the concept of urbanity, or civility, which is a quality of being courteous and considerate. From a broader perspective, it refers to a high degree of social refinement. The verse states that those who desire to cultivate such a level of urbanity that everyone admires, will maintain amicability even with those who have wronged them. \n\nThe metaphor of swallowing poison served by friends is a profound one. It suggests an act of betrayal or harm done by those close to us. Yet, the verse asserts that true urbanity lies in the ability to forgive such transgressions, assimilate them without retaliation, and continue to be friendly. This metaphorical 'swallowing of poison' essentially represents the act of enduring pain or insult without seeking revenge or harboring resentment.\n\nSo, the verse emphasizes the virtue of forgiveness and patience in maintaining social harmony. This is a significant principle in Tamil culture where the value of maintaining relationships and social cohesion is highly esteemed. It implies that the magnanimity to forgive and forget is the sign of a refined person, who is loved and respected by all. The moral lesson from the verse is to uphold dignity and grace in all circumstances, even in the face of betrayal or harm..The kural verse:ஒற்றும் உரைசான்ற நூலும் இவையிரண்டும்தெற்றென்க மன்னவன் கண். ,translates to :A king should treat these two as eyes  The code of laws and careful spies,and it's explantion is :Kural 581 emphasizes the importance of intelligence and law for a ruler. The verse metaphorically suggests that a ruler should consider a spy (intelligence network) and a universally esteemed book of laws as his 'eyes'. \n\nIn this context, the 'spy' represents a reliable source of information. A king should have trustworthy messengers or spies who can provide him with honest, accurate, and timely information about the state of his kingdom, the mood of his subjects, and any threats or challenges that might be arising. The importance of having a capable intelligence network can't be overstated, as it enables a ruler to make informed decisions and anticipate problems before they become crises.\n\nThe 'book of laws', on the other hand, symbolizes sound governance and justice. A universally esteemed book of laws indicates a set of rules and regulations that have been proven over time to be fair, just, and effective. A king should govern his kingdom based on these established laws, ensuring that justice is served and that his subjects are treated fairly.\n\nIn essence, this verse suggests that a successful ruler is one who combines effective intelligence gathering with fair and just governance. The king's 'eyes', in this metaphor, are the tools he uses to see and understand his kingdom, and these tools should be reliable (spies) and righteous (the book of laws)..The kural verse:எல்லார்க்கும் எல்லாம் நிகழ்பவை எஞ்ஞான்றும்வல்லறிதல் வேந்தன் தொழில். ,translates to :All that happens, always, to all  The king should know in full detail,and it's explantion is :The Kural 582 emphasizes the role of a king as a discerning observer. It underscores that it is the king's duty to promptly know everything that happens to everyone, at all times. This includes friends, enemies, and neutral parties. \n\nThe essence of this verse lies in the concept of vigilant governance. A king, or any leader, should have an in-depth understanding of all events happening in his kingdom, irrespective of the time or the people involved. This knowledge allows the king to make informed decisions, maintain peace, and ensure justice. \n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse can be applied to modern leadership as well, where a leader has to stay informed and aware of all developments amongst their team or organization for effective leadership. This constant vigilance and quick understanding of situations enable the leader to respond promptly to any issues and make wise decisions.\n\nTherefore, the verse talks about the importance of being informed and aware as a leader, be it a king in the olden days or a leader in the current times. It highlights the importance of vigilance, quick understanding, and the ability to respond promptly to situations as crucial leadership qualities..The kural verse:ஒற்றினான் ஒற்றிப் பொருள்தெரியா மன்னவன்கொற்றங் கொளக்கிடந்தது இல். ,translates to :Conquests are not for the monarch Who cares not for the Spy's remark,and it's explantion is :Kural 583 explores the importance of information gathering and strategic planning in governance, specifically in the context of a king or leader. \n\nThe verse suggests that a king who does not understand the value of information gleaned by a spy or informant is unlikely to achieve successful conquests or victories. This is because such information can provide crucial insights into the state of affairs, the strengths and weaknesses of enemies, and potential opportunities or threats.\n\nThe underlying message here is the importance of being well-informed and making strategic decisions based on thorough analysis and understanding. It emphasizes the necessity of intelligence gathering and strategic planning in any aspect of leadership, not just in warfare or conquests. \n\nIn broader terms, this verse resonates with modern concepts of leadership and management, where decision-making is often based on intelligence gathered from various sources and thorough analysis of data.\n\nThis Kural, therefore, advocates for proactive and strategic decision making, underlining the importance of information gathering, understanding, and execution for effective leadership and success in any endeavor..The kural verse:வினைசெய்வார் தம்சுற்றம் வேண்டாதார் என்றாங்குஅனைவரையும் ஆராய்வது ஒற்று. ,translates to :His officers, kinsmen and foes  Who watch keenly are worthy spies,and it's explantion is :Kural 584 speaks about the role and characteristics of a spy in a king's court. According to Valluvar, a true spy is someone who impartially observes and understands the actions and intentions of all people associated with the king. This includes those who work for the king, his relatives, and his enemies. \n\nThe spy's job is not to judge, but to gather information. They are required to observe everyone, regardless of their relationship with the king or their status in the court. By doing this, they are able to provide a clear and unbiased view of the activities in the kingdom, which can assist the king in making informed decisions.\n\nThe Kural here emphasizes the importance of impartiality and keen observation in espionage. It instructs that a good spy should not favor or discriminate against anyone, but should watch everyone equally to get a true understanding of the situation. This is a crucial skill for maintaining the stability and security of a kingdom..The kural verse:கடாஅ உருவொடு கண்ணஞ்சாது யாண்டும்உகாஅமை வல்லதே ஒற்று. ,translates to :Fearless gaze, suspectless guise  Guarding secrets mark the spies,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural talks about the qualities of a spy or a scout. In the context of ancient times, a spy was an essential part of a kingdom's defense and strategy. Their role was to infiltrate the enemy ranks, gather crucial information, and relay it back to their own kingdom without getting caught.\n\nIn this verse, the poet Valluvar describes the ideal characteristics of a spy. Firstly, a spy should be able to blend in with his surroundings, taking on an identity that arouses no suspicion. This could mean adopting the customs, language, and behavior of the people among whom he is spying to avoid detection.\n\nSecondly, a spy must be fearless. He should not be intimidated by anyone, regardless of their rank or power. This is crucial as his job often requires him to be in the presence of powerful individuals in the enemy ranks.\n\nLastly, and most importantly, a spy must be secretive. No matter what situations he faces or what pressures he is under, he should never reveal his true purpose. This is paramount as the success of his mission and often his own life depends on his ability to keep his true identity and purpose hidden.\n\nHence, this verse emphasizes the importance of adaptability, courage, and secrecy for a spy to be successful in his mission. These qualities, while described in the context of a spy, can also be applied to various aspects of life where tact, bravery, and discretion are required..The kural verse:துறந்தார் படிவத்த ராகி இறந்தாராய்ந்துஎன்செயினும் சோர்விலது ஒற்று. ,translates to :Guised as monks they gather secrets They betray them not under threats,and it's explantion is :The Kural 586 speaks about the characteristics of a perfect spy. According to this verse, a spy is one who disguises himself as an ascetic, which allows him to go to places without arousing suspicion. The ascetic disguise is a strategic choice because of the respect and acceptance they receive in society, allowing them unhindered access to various social and political environments.\n\nThe verse further adds that a spy should be able to investigate and gather necessary information without revealing his true purpose. In this process, he might face various challenges and hardships. It could be intense interrogation or even physical torture. However, a true and effective spy never reveals his identity or mission, no matter the amount of pressure or pain he is subjected to. \n\nThe primary objective of a spy is to obtain information without revealing his identity, and hence, the ability to endure hardships without confession is highly valued. This Kural essentially emphasizes the importance of resilience, stealth, and the ability to blend in for a spy, which are key to his success. \n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse can also be interpreted as highlighting the importance of dedication, perseverance, and the ability to maintain discretion in the face of adversity, which are valuable traits in many walks of life..The kural verse:மறைந்தவை கேட்கவற் றாகி அறிந்தவைஐயப்பாடு இல்லதே ஒற்று. ,translates to :A spy draws out other's secrets Beyond a doubt he clears his facts,and it's explantion is :Kural 587 emphasizes the role of a spy or an informant in the realm of governance and strategic planning. The verse delineates the essential qualities of a good spy, who is defined as someone capable of uncovering hidden or secret information and having no doubts or confusion about the information he has gathered. \n\nThe verse appreciates the ability of a spy to penetrate the secrecy of others, understand the truth behind their actions, and maintain absolute clarity about it. The spy, as described in this verse, has an uncanny knack for extracting information directly from the source without arousing suspicion. \n\nAdditionally, the spy is also expected to be devoid of misconceptions or doubts about the information obtained. This implies a high degree of intelligence, analytical ability, and discernment to separate the grain from the chaff, truth from falsehood, and make sense of the information gathered. \n\nIn this verse, Thiruvalluvar points out that the effectiveness of a spy lies not just in gathering information but also in comprehending its implications correctly without any ambiguity. In the grand scheme of governance, such a spy is an invaluable asset, enabling the ruler to make informed decisions based on accurate and reliable intelligence..The kural verse:ஒற்றொற்றித் தந்த பொருளையும் மற்றுமோர்ஒற்றினால் ஒற்றிக் கொளல். ,translates to :The reports given by one spy By another spy verify,and it's explantion is :Kural 588 emphasizes the importance of cross-validation and caution in accepting information, particularly in the context of governance and decision-making. \n\nThis verse advises a king not to accept the information provided by a spy at face value. Even if the spy is competent and trustworthy, the king should not rely solely on this single source. Instead, he should cross-verify the information with another spy before concluding its veracity. This recommendation reflects the ancient wisdom of not basing crucial decisions on unverified information, a principle that is still relevant in today's world, especially in matters of leadership, governance, and policy-making.\n\nThe underlying moral lesson is the need for critical examination and the avoidance of hasty judgments based on singular sources. It also signifies the importance of verification and the risk of misinformation, suggesting that one should always seek multiple perspectives to arrive at the truth. This kural thus offers practical advice for leaders and decision-makers to ensure informed and accurate decisions..The kural verse:ஒற்றெற் றுணராமை ஆள்க உடன்மூவர்சொற்றொக்க தேறப் படும். ,translates to :Engage the spies alone, apart When three agree confirm report,and it's explantion is :This Thirukkural emphasizes the importance of information validation and secrecy in governance. It advises a ruler to employ spies who are not aware of each other's existence or operations. This ensures that the information they gather is not influenced or manipulated by each other, maintaining the integrity of their intelligence.\n\nThe Kural then talks about the verification of information. It suggests that if the data gathered independently by three spies aligns, then it can be considered as reliable. This implies a system of cross-verification, adding an additional layer of security and accuracy to the intelligence. \n\nOverall, this Thirukkural provides a wise approach to information gathering and decision making in leadership. It underscores the need for meticulous planning, secrecy, independent operations, and stringent verification processes to ensure the validity of intelligence. This not only applies to governance but also to any situation where crucial decisions are made based on the gathering and analysis of information, like in business, research, or investigation..The kural verse:சிறப்பறிய ஒற்றின்கண் செய்யற்க செய்யின்புறப்படுத்தான் ஆகும் மறை. ,translates to :Give not the spy open reward It would divulge the secret heard!,and it's explantion is :This verse advises rulers on the delicate management of their spies or secret informants. It emphasizes that a leader should not publicly acknowledge or reward a spy, as it could lead to exposure of both the spy's identity and the king's secret information. \n\nThe verse uses a spy as a metaphor to underscore the importance of discretion in sensitive matters. By giving a spy public recognition, a ruler risks revealing not only the spy's covert role but also the confidential matters the spy was trusted to handle. This could jeopardize the effectiveness of the spy and potentially compromise the safety of the kingdom. \n\nThe broader ethical lesson here is the importance of prudence and discretion in leadership. Leaders must carefully manage sensitive information and those entrusted with it, ensuring their actions do not inadvertently reveal what is intended to be confidential. This Kural teaches us that acknowledgement and reward, while important, must be handled with care and wisdom, especially in sensitive contexts..The kural verse:உடையர் எனப்படுவது ஊக்கம் அஃதில்லார்உடையது உடையரோ மற்று. ,translates to :To own is to own energy All others own but lethargy,and it's explantion is :This Kural suggests that energy or willpower is the true wealth of a person. It asserts that only those possessing energy or determination are considered truly wealthy, regardless of their material possessions. Those who lack such energy, no matter what they physically own, cannot be deemed as truly wealthy. \n\nThe essence of this Kural lies in the idea that ownership is not just about physical possession but also about the ability to utilize and manage what one owns. This can be achieved only through willpower and energy. If one lacks the drive and determination, they cannot truly 'own' or make the most of their possessions, as they won't be able to use them effectively. Hence, true possession is not just about material wealth, but also about the inner strength and energy to make the best use of it.\n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse encourages the cultivation of inner strength and determination, emphasizing that they are more important than material wealth. This has relevance in today's world too, where success is not just defined by what one owns, but by the determination and willpower behind achieving it..The kural verse:உள்ளம் உடைமை உடைமை பொருளுடைமைநில்லாது நீங்கி விடும். ,translates to :Psychic heart is wealth indeed Worldly wealth departs in speed,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of mental strength and determination, stating that it is the true wealth a person can possess. The verse says that the ownership of material wealth is transient and does not stay with one forever. \n\nThe term \"possession of the mind\" refers to the inner strength, motivation, and willpower an individual has. According to Valluvar, this is the true and permanent asset that an individual can possess. It is this mental energy that drives a person to strive, overcome obstacles, and achieve their goals.\n\nOn the other hand, material wealth, though valued highly in the worldly sense, is described as fleeting. It can be acquired and lost, and does not remain constant. Material wealth also does not guarantee happiness or contentment. Thus, Valluvar emphasizes that it is not a true possession.\n\nIn essence, this verse advocates the development of inner strength and resilience, as they are the real assets that help an individual navigate through life's challenges. It also subtly reminds us of the impermanence of material wealth, urging us to not be overly attached to it..The kural verse:ஆக்கம் இழந்தேமென்று அல்லாவார் ஊக்கம்ஒருவந்தம் கைத்துடை யார். ,translates to :The strong in will do not complain  The loss of worldly wealth and gain,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of unwavering determination and resilience in the face of adversity. It suggests that those who possess an enduring spirit or energy will not lament over their lost wealth or property. \n\nThe essence of this verse is that material possessions, such as wealth or property, may come and go, but what truly matters is one's inner resolve and determination. This inner strength, once established, is not easily shaken, not even by significant material loss. \n\nIn other words, regardless of external circumstances, one's inner strength or drive (referred to as \"ookkam\" in Tamil) should remain unyielding. This internal energy is the real asset one should aim to possess, as it remains untouched by external losses or gains. \n\nUltimately, the verse teaches the importance of resilience, urging us not to be swayed by material losses but to focus on nurturing and maintaining our inner strength and resolve. It encourages us to view setbacks not as a reason for despair, but as opportunities for growth and strengthening of our character..The kural verse:ஆக்கம் அதர்வினாய்ச் செல்லும் அசைவிலாஊக்க முடையா னுழை. ,translates to :Fortune enquires, enters with boom Where tireless strivers have their home,and it's explantion is :The Kural verse 594 emphasizes the power of relentless determination and unwavering energy. It essentially says that wealth inevitably finds its way to the person who possesses unyielding enthusiasm and ceaseless energy, indicating that prosperity is drawn towards those who exhibit such qualities.\n\nThe verse asserts that it is not merely enough to desire wealth, but one must also possess the drive, motivation, and perseverance to work towards it. Wealth doesn't merely come to those who wish for it, but to those who tirelessly strive for it with great intensity and determination.\n\nThis idea is a common theme in many cultures and philosophies, emphasizing the importance of hard work, eagerness, and an unwavering resolve in achieving success and prosperity. It encourages individuals to cultivate these qualities to attract wealth and prosperity in their lives.\n\nThe verse also subtly indicates that wealth is not a static entity but a dynamic one, constantly on the move, seeking those who are worthy of it based on their efforts and energy. It reinforces the belief that wealth, success, and prosperity are not mere matters of luck or fate, but the results of one's efforts and determination..The kural verse:வெள்ளத் தனைய மலர்நீட்டம் மாந்தர்தம்உள்ளத் தனையது உயர்வு. ,translates to :Water depth is lotus height  Mental strength is men's merit,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse 595 offers a vivid analogy to express the concept of personal growth and self-development. The verse likens the growth of water-flower stalks to the depth of the water they grow in, to the greatness of people being proportionate to the depth of their minds.\n\nIn simpler terms, the verse implies that the deeper the water, the taller the water-flower stalks can grow. Similarly, the more profound and expansive a person's mind and thoughts are, the greater their potential for personal growth and achievements. \n\nThe depth of water represents the capacity for growth and the potential for development. Just as the water-flower stalks require deep waters to reach their full height, individuals need a deep and expansive mindset to reach their full potential. \n\nTherefore, the verse sends a clear message that personal greatness and high accomplishments are directly proportionate to the depth and expansiveness of one's mind. It encourages cultivating profound thoughts and a broad mind to achieve greatness in life. \n\nIn essence, this verse suggests that the mind's depth and quality significantly influence an individual's growth, development, and success. It underscores the importance of mental strength, contemplative thought, and a positive mindset in achieving personal growth and success. It is a timeless reminder of the power of the mind in shaping our lives and destinities..The kural verse:உள்ளுவ தெல்லாம் உயர்வுள்ளல் மற்றதுதள்ளினுந் தள்ளாமை நீர்த்து. ,translates to :Let thoughts be always great and grand  Though they fail their virtues stand,and it's explantion is :The verse speaks about the importance of ambition and the attitude of perseverance in a leader or a king. Every thought that a king has should be filled with the aspiration for greatness and elevated stature. This doesn't mean an excessive desire for power or control, but rather, the pursuit of excellence in leadership, administration, and welfare of his people.\n\nThe second part of the verse adds a crucial perspective - even if the planned greatness seems unattainable or gets thwarted by unforeseen circumstances, the king should not relinquish his ambition. It emphasizes that one must persist in their pursuit of greatness despite setbacks or failures. \n\nThe verse underscores that such an attitude of unyielding perseverance gives an impression of high stature and greatness, even if the initial objective was not fulfilled. This is because the act of striving for greatness and not giving up in the face of adversity is a sign of true leadership and is respected by others. \n\nIn essence, this Thiru Kural verse encourages leaders to harbour high aspirations and persist in their pursuit, irrespective of the challenges faced. It highlights that the journey towards greatness, marked by relentless effort and resilience, is as important as the achievement of the goal itself..The kural verse:சிதைவிடத்து ஒல்கார் உரவோர் புதையம்பிற்பட்டுப்பா டூன்றுங் களிறு. ,translates to :Elephants are firm when arrows hit Great minds keep fit ev'n in defeat,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse emphasizes the unyielding spirit and resilience of the strong-minded individuals. It compares them to an elephant that stands firm even when it is wounded by a shower of arrows. \n\nThe verse metaphorically suggests that just as an elephant, despite being injured, maintains its majesty and strength, so does a person with a strong mind and determination remain unshaken even when faced with significant setbacks or losses. \n\nThrough this comparison, the poet Valluvar highlights the importance of mental fortitude and resolve. He implies that it is our inner strength and determination, rather than our external circumstances, that truly define us. Even in the face of adversity, a strong-minded individual does not succumb to despair but continues to stand firm, just like the elephant that does not falter under a shower of arrows. \n\nThus, the verse teaches us the value of resilience, mental toughness, and the power of a resolute mind in overcoming challenges and adversities..The kural verse:உள்ளம் இலாதவர் எய்தார் உலகத்துவள்ளியம் என்னுஞ் செருக்கு. ,translates to :Heartless persons cannot boast \\\"We are liberal to our best\\\",and it's explantion is :Kural 598 emphasizes the importance of generosity and the joy it brings. The verse suggests that those who lack a generous spirit, or 'greatness of mind', will never experience the joy and pride of being known as a benefactor in the world. The term 'liberality' here signifies the act of giving or sharing freely without expecting anything in return. \n\nIn the societal and cultural context of Thiruvalluvar's time, generosity was considered a virtue of the highest order. It was seen as a sign of nobility and moral superiority. Those known for their generosity were held in high esteem and respect. Therefore, the verse implies that without the spirit of generosity, one would miss out on the joy and social prestige associated with being a benefactor.\n\nThe verse also subtly underscores the psychological rewards of generosity. It suggests that it's not just the recipient who benefits from an act of giving, but the giver too, as it instills a sense of fulfillment, self-worth, and happiness. Therefore, it encourages individuals to cultivate and exercise generosity for their personal joy and societal recognition..The kural verse:பரியது கூர்ங்கோட்டது ஆயினும் யானை஦வ்ருஉம் புலிதாக் குறின். ,translates to :Huge elephant sharp in tusk quails  When tiger, less in form, assails,and it's explantion is :The Kural 599 emphasizes the significance of courage over physical strength. Even though the elephant is mighty, with a large body and sharp tusks, it fears the attack of a tiger. This is because the tiger, though physically smaller, embodies the power of courage.\n\nThis verse metaphorically highlights the importance of inner strength, bravery, and determination. It suggests that physical attributes are less significant when compared to the mental strength and courage of an individual. In our lives, this could be interpreted as a reminder that the strength of our character, confidence, and determination often matter more than our physical abilities in tackling challenges and overcoming obstacles.\n\nJust as the elephant, despite its size and strength, fears the smaller but courageous tiger, individuals with seemingly less physical power but greater courage can often overcome stronger opponents..The kural verse:உரமொருவற்கு உள்ள வெறுக்கைஅஃ தில்லார்மரம்மக்க ளாதலே வேறு. ,translates to :Mental courage is true manhood Lacking that man is like a wood,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of mental energy or motivation in a person's life. It suggests that the real strength or wealth of a person lies not in their physical abilities or material possessions, but in their mental vigor.\n\nThe verse uses a powerful metaphor to illustrate this point. It compares people who lack mental energy to trees, suggesting that they are only human in form but not in essence. Just like a tree, they might be physically present, but without the capacity for action, thought, or emotion, they are not truly living their human lives. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse encourages us to nurture our mental energy, as it is the driving force behind our actions and achievements. It reminds us that being human means more than just existing - it involves thinking, feeling, and actively participating in life.\n\nThe verse also subtly criticizes those who are passive or disinterested in their lives, likening them to inanimate objects. It calls for an active, energetic approach to life, emphasizing the value of inner strength and determination.\n\nIn sum, this Kural verse illuminates the critical role of mental energy in leading a fulfilling and meaningful life. It underscores the idea that our inner strength, embodied in our willpower and motivation, is what truly defines us as human beings..The kural verse:குடியென்னும் குன்றா விளக்கம் மடியென்னும்மாசூர மாய்ந்து கெடும். ,translates to :Quenchless lamp of ancestry goes When foul idleness encloses,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural emphasizes the destructive influence of idleness on one's reputation and family stature. The verse metaphorically calls family reputation an \"indestructible lamp,\" a beacon that illuminates one's identity and social standing. However, it cautions that this lamp can be extinguished by the \"darkness of idleness.\"\n\nIn the Tamil society and many others, a person's family or lineage (Kudi) holds significant importance and is considered a symbol of their identity and honor. This idea is represented by the metaphor of the powerful, bright lamp. The Kural warns that despite this brightness, idleness - the lack of activity or unwillingness to work - can slowly diminish this light, causing the family reputation to fade and eventually disappear.\n\nThe Kural, hence, encourages active engagement in one's responsibilities and hard work, highlighting the potential repercussions of sloth. It also underlines the interconnectedness of individual behavior with the family's reputation, urging individuals to uphold their family honor through diligent efforts. This verse is as much a call to personal responsibility as it is a commentary on the societal importance of maintaining one's family reputation..The kural verse:மடியை மடியா ஒழுகல் குடியைக்குடியாக வேண்டு பவர். ,translates to :To make your home an ideal home Loath sloth as sloth; refuse it room,and it's explantion is :The Kural 602 emphasizes the importance of diligence and effort towards enhancing the reputation and stature of one's family. If one aspires for their family to be distinguished and respected, they must eradicate all forms of laziness from their behaviour. \n\nThe verse advises individuals to adopt a proactive and industrious attitude, rather than being idle or passive. Laziness is seen as a detrimental trait that hinders the progress and growth of a family's stature, and therefore, must be eliminated. \n\nThis Kural imparts a universal lesson that success and respect are attained not merely by desire, but through consistent effort and hard work. It reinforces the idea that one's family reputation is a reflection of one's actions and attitudes, and therefore it's important to act responsibly and diligently. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar advocates for active engagement in one's responsibilities and duties as the path to uplift one's family reputation and achieve success..The kural verse:மடிமடிக் கொண்டொழுகும் பேதை பிறந்தகுடிமடியும் தன்னினும் முந்து. ,translates to :The fool who fosters sluggishness Before he dies ruins his house,and it's explantion is :Kural 603 is a stark warning against the destructive nature of laziness, particularly when it becomes a prevalent trait in an individual. The verse emphasizes that laziness is not merely a personal failing, but its effects can lead to the downfall of the entire family or lineage to which the individual belongs. \n\nThe phrase 'destructive laziness' is used to underline the severity of the impact of this habit. It isn't an innocuous or benign trait but a corrosive one that can erode the foundation of even a well-established family. \n\nThe latter part of the verse, \"even before he is dead\", suggests that the repercussions of this harmful habit are felt not in some distant future, but in the immediate present. This indicates the rapidity with which laziness can lead to ruin.\n\nIn a cultural context, the verse also highlights the importance placed on industriousness and diligence in Tamil society. Laziness is seen as the antithesis of these virtues, leading to decline and disrepute. The verse sends a clear message that the preservation of a family's reputation and prosperity depends on the active, diligent efforts of its members. \n\nIn a broader moral sense, the kural encourages personal responsibility, action, and the avoidance of complacency as essential elements of a respectable and successful life. It warns that laziness is not just a personal weakness, but a habit that can affect others, underscoring the interconnectedness of individuals within a family or society..The kural verse:குடிமடிந்து குற்றம் பெருகும் மடிமடிந்துமாண்ட உஞற்றி லவர்க்கு. ,translates to :Who strive not high, sunk deep in sloth Ruin their house by evil growth,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural emphasizes the detrimental effects of laziness and lack of effort. It states that when a person falls into the trap of idleness and refrains from making any constructive effort, it not only leads to the amplification of his/her faults but also brings down the prestige and honor of their family.\n\nThe verse is a strong reminder of the importance of hard work and diligence. In a cultural context, it resonates with the traditional Indian values that place a great emphasis on the respect and honor of the family. It cautions that apathy and lack of motivation not only harm the individual but also tarnish the family's reputation.\n\nFurthermore, the verse implies that inactivity is a breeding ground for vices. When one doesn't engage in meaningful activities, it's easy to fall prey to negative habits or behaviors. Therefore, it encourages individuals to be diligent and active, as it not only enhances personal growth but also contributes to the overall well-being and honor of one's family. \n\nIn essence, Thirukkural 604 is a call to action, urging individuals to shun laziness, strive for excellence, and uphold the honor of their family through their actions..The kural verse:நெடுநீர் மறவி மடிதுயில் நான்கும்கெடுநீரார் காமக் கலன். ,translates to :To lag, forget, idle and doze These four are pleasure boats of loss,and it's explantion is :This Thirukkural verse speaks about four detrimental habits that can lead to a person's downfall or destruction. These habits are procrastination, forgetfulness, idleness, and excessive sleep.\n\n1. Procrastination: This refers to the habit of delaying or postponing tasks. It can lead to a lack of productivity and missed opportunities. This verse warns against letting time slip away without accomplishing anything meaningful, which is a common trait of those heading towards ruin.\n\n2. Forgetfulness: This can be a sign of a lack of focus or attention. It might result in important tasks being overlooked or neglected, leading to unfavorable outcomes. The verse indicates that forgetfulness is a trait of those who are destined for failure.\n\n3. Idleness: This is a state of inactivity or laziness. An idle person does not make any effort to achieve goals or make progress in life. This Kural suggests that idleness is a characteristic of those who are on a path of destruction.\n\n4. Excessive sleep: While sleep is essential for health and well-being, too much sleep can be a sign of lethargy and a lack of motivation. Excessive sleep can lead to wasted time and missed opportunities. This verse implies that those who sleep excessively are likely to face ruin.\n\nIn essence, this verse encourages active engagement, mindfulness, diligence, and balance in sleep to avoid a path of destruction. The \"vessel\" metaphorically refers to the destructive path that these traits lead to, indicating that those who indulge in these habits are choosing to board a ship destined for failure..The kural verse:படியுடையார் பற்றமைந்தக் கண்ணும் மடியுடையார்மாண்பயன் எய்தல் அரிது. ,translates to :With all the wealth of lords of earth The slothful gain nothing of worth,and it's explantion is :The verse 606 from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of industriousness and the futility of idleness, regardless of one's wealth and status. The verse suggests that even if one possesses the wealth equivalent to that of kings who ruled vast lands, if they are idle by nature, it is unlikely for them to derive significant benefit from it.\n\nThis verse serves as a reminder that wealth and resources alone are not enough to bring prosperity or honor. It underscores the vital role of personal effort, industriousness, and the correct utilization of resources in achieving success and honor. Without these qualities, even the vast wealth can lay wasted, providing no substantial benefit to the person.\n\nThe verse thus promotes the virtues of hard work and active engagement, while cautioning against the pitfalls of idleness, irrespective of one's wealth and possessions. The moral conveyed is universal and timeless, stressing that the key to success lies not just in the abundance of resources, but in their effective utilization through active engagement and effort..The kural verse:இடிபுரிந்து எள்ளுஞ்சொல் கேட்பர் மடிபுரிந்துமாண்ட உஞற்றி லவர். ,translates to :The slothful lacking noble deeds Subject themselves to scornful words,and it's explantion is :Kural 607 emphasizes the adverse effects of idleness on an individual's reputation and dignity. The verse suggests that those who willingly choose a life of laziness, avoiding any form of disciplined and dignified effort, will inevitably face the consequence of being disrespected and ridiculed by others. \n\nThe verse points out that society tends to view inaction or lack of effort as a sign of weakness. It also indicates that those who do not make any effort to better themselves or their situation, choosing instead a life of idle ease, will be subjected to the scorn and ridicule of others. They will be made fun of, their words will be disregarded, and they will be belittled due to their lack of initiative or ambition.\n\nThis Kural serves as a reminder and a caution against the perils of idleness. It underlines the importance of hard work, perseverance, and the need to strive for improvement and growth. In essence, it's a call to action, urging individuals to engage in meaningful and dignified exertions, for it is through such endeavors that one can earn respect and preserve their dignity..The kural verse:மடிமை குடிமைக்கண் தங்கின்தன் ஒன்னார்க்குஅடிமை புகுத்தி விடும். ,translates to :If sloth invades a noble house It will become a slave of foes,and it's explantion is :Kural 608 is a cautionary verse on the perilous effects of idleness, especially in the context of leadership and nobility. \n\nThe verse states, \"If idleness take up its abode in a king of high birth, it will make him a slave of his enemies.\" This implies that even if a person is born into a prestigious family or holds a high position such as a king, indolence or lethargy can lead to their downfall. This is because laziness or lack of motivation can prevent a leader from performing their duties effectively, thereby making them vulnerable to their adversaries. \n\nThe verse underscores the importance of diligence and constant vigilance for those in power. It suggests that irrespective of one's social standing, idleness can lead to the loss of power and prestige, and even result in subjugation by one's enemies. The verse hence serves as a reminder that one's social position or birthright should not lead to complacency, and that continuous effort and hard work are crucial for maintaining one's status and warding off potential threats. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can be applied to all individuals, not just leaders. It suggests that laziness can lead to failure and loss of respect, and emphasizes the importance of hard work and diligence in achieving and maintaining success..The kural verse:குடியாண்மை யுள்வந்த குற்றம் ஒருவன்மடியாண்மை மாற்றக் கெடும். ,translates to :The blots on race and rule shall cease When one from sloth gets his release,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 609, is a profound commentary on the detrimental effects of idleness and the transformative power of diligence.\n\nThe verse states that when a person eradicates idleness from their life, the reproach or dishonor that had tainted both his personal reputation and his family's standing will dissipate. The 'reproach' here refers to the negative connotations and unfavorable judgments associated with a person who is idle or unproductive. In many cultures, including ancient Tamil society, idleness was considered a sign of irresponsibility and lack of initiative.\n\nThe 'family' in this context can be interpreted broadly to include not only the immediate family but also the lineage or clan. In many traditional societies, an individual's actions were seen to reflect on their entire family or even their community. Therefore, an individual's idleness could bring disrepute not only upon themselves but also upon their family.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the transformative power of diligence and hard work. By abandoning idleness, the individual can restore their own honor and that of their family. This suggests a moral and ethical framework where personal initiative and productivity are highly valued, and where one has the power to shape their own reputation and standing through their actions. \n\nIn short, this verse underscores the negative impact of idleness and the positive power of proactive action in shaping one's personal and familial reputation..The kural verse:மடியிலா மன்னவன் எய்தும் அடியளந்தான்தாஅய தெல்லாம் ஒருங்கு. ,translates to :The slothless king shall gain en masse *All regions trod by Lord apace * Hindu mythology holds that Lord Vishnu measured with his feet the three worlds,and it's explantion is :Kural 610 carries a profound message about the virtue of diligence and the perils of idleness. The verse metaphorically refers to a king, but the moral it enshrines is applicable to anyone in a position of leadership or responsibility.\n\nThe king in the verse symbolizes a leader or a person with power and responsibility. The verse states that a king who does not succumb to idleness will obtain complete possession or control of his realm. The verse employs a beautiful metaphor from Hindu mythology - the reference to \"him who measured the worlds with His foot\" is a nod to the Vamana avatar of Lord Vishnu, who is said to have measured the entire universe with just three steps.\n\nThe underlying message is about the power of diligence and active engagement in one's duties. Whether in the context of a king ruling his kingdom, a leader guiding his team, or an individual managing his life, a proactive and industrious approach is crucial. Idleness, in contrast, can lead to stagnation, missed opportunities, and eventual decline.\n\nIn a broader sense, the verse is a reminder that success, be it in leadership, governance, or personal life, requires constant effort and active engagement. The verse urges us to embrace diligence and vigilance as vital tools for growth and accomplishment. \n\nMoreover, the verse also subtly alludes to the concept of 'divine right' or 'karma' - implying that diligent and righteous actions align us with the divine order of the universe, enabling us to gain rightful rewards and prosper..The kural verse:அருமை உடைத்தென்று அசாவாமை வேண்டும்பெருமை முயற்சி தரும். ,translates to :Feel not frustrate saying This hard Who tries attains striving's reward,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of perseverance and the strength of willpower. It advises against succumbing to the feeling of inadequacy or the belief that a task might be too challenging or beyond one's capabilities. Instead, it encourages the reader to persevere with unyielding determination and effort.\n\nThe verse advocates the idea that nothing is impossible if one is willing to put in the required effort. It can be understood as a call to action against self-doubt and a reminder of the power of human determination. By stating that \"labour will give the greatness (of mind) which is necessary (to do it),\" it suggests that the act of striving towards a goal, despite the difficulties, is in itself a sign of greatness and strength of character.\n\nIn a broader cultural context, this verse aligns with the core values of perseverance and diligence that are often seen in Tamil philosophy and literature. It encourages the belief in one's abilities and the willingness to face challenges head-on, reinforcing the concept that hard work and determination can overcome obstacles and lead to success.\n\nIn short, this verse is a motivational reminder that discouragement and self-doubt should not prevent one from attempting to achieve their goals. Instead, it encourages persistent effort and resilience as a means to develop the inner strength required to overcome challenges and achieve success..The kural verse:வினைக்கண் வினைகெடல் ஓம்பல் வினைக்குறைதீர்ந்தாரின் தீர்ந்தன்று உலகு. ,translates to :In doing work don't break and shirk The world will quit who quits his work,and it's explantion is :The Kural 612 encourages unwavering diligence and persistence in any undertaking. It advices not to abandon or give up halfway through any work or task. In the larger context, the verse is a commentary on the importance of consistency and tenacity in action. \n\nIt suggests that the world respects and appreciates those who complete their tasks with determination and without faltering in the face of difficulties. On the other hand, those who abandon their work halfway, due to challenges or lack of perseverance, are often disregarded or abandoned by society. \n\nThe message conveyed is a call to develop a strong work ethic, dedication, and resilience, as these are values highly regarded in society. It stresses that the successful completion of a task, regardless of its magnitude, earns one respect and recognition in society. \n\nIn other words, commitment to one's duty until its completion, irrespective of the obstacles faced, is a virtue that is esteemed by the world. Those who lack this commitment are likely to be overlooked or forgotten. \n\nThis principle applies to all aspects of life, be it personal, professional, or societal. Thus, this verse serves as a timeless reminder of the value of perseverance and the importance of seeing tasks through to their end. \n\nThis Kural is a part of the chapter on 'Perseverance' in Thiru Kural, and it is as relevant today as it was when it was written, emphasizing the timeless nature of the wisdom contained in Thiru Kural.\n.The kural verse:தாளாண்மை என்னும் தகைமைக்கண் தங்கிற்றேவேளாண்மை என்னுஞ் செருக்கு. ,translates to :On excellence of industry Depends magnanimous bounty,and it's explantion is :Kural 613 extols the virtue of hard work and the nobility that comes from it. This verse intricately ties the act of generosity to the dignity of labor. It suggests that the ability to be generous or munificent is a direct result of one's willingness to work hard. \n\nIn the context of this Kural, 'munificence' refers to the act of giving or helping others, which is usually associated with wealth or surplus. However, the Kural posits that this trait is not solely dependent on one's material wealth, but rather on one's efforts or laboriousness. \n\nThe 'dignity of laboriousness' is an elevated trait, a sign of a strong character that embraces effort and hard work. This trait is praised as it leads to the ability to help others, an act of kindness that is deeply valued. \n\nIn essence, this Kural emphasizes that the glory of generosity rests upon the dignity of hard work. Hence, the ability to give and help others is not merely a function of wealth, but a testament to one's diligence and perseverance. \n\nThis verse gives a profound message about the importance of hard work and the virtue of generosity, a lesson that emphasizes the inseparable relationship between effort and reward, not just in terms of material wealth, but also in terms of personal character and integrity..The kural verse:தாளாண்மை இல்லாதான் வேளாண்மை பேடிகைவாளாண்மை போலக் கெடும். ,translates to :Bounty of man who never strives Like sword in eunuch's hand it fails,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural emphasizes the importance of effort and labor in being generous or helpful. The verse metaphorically compares a person who wants to be generous without putting in any effort to a hermaphrodite who carries a sword but lacks the courage to use it.\n\nThe term \"hermaphrodite\" here symbolizes a person who is indecisive or lacks the strength to act, despite having the necessary tools or resources. Similarly, a person who wishes to be generous without any effort or labor is like holding a sword without the courage to use it. Such generosity will eventually fail because it lacks the foundation of hard work and effort.\n\nIn essence, Valluvar underlines that generosity is not merely about having resources or the desire to help, but it demands active labor and effort. Without this active contribution, any form of generosity or charity becomes empty and ineffective, much like a sword in the hand of someone who lacks the courage or the will to wield it..The kural verse:இன்பம் விழையான் வினைவிழைவான் தன்கேளிர்துன்பம் துடைத்தூன்றும் தூண். ,translates to :Work who likes and not pleasure  Wipes grief of friends, pillar secure,and it's explantion is :The Kural 615 emphasizes the importance of work ethics and selflessness. It suggests that an individual who does not seek personal pleasure but rather takes pleasure in hard work becomes a reliable support for his family and community. Such a person is capable of alleviating the troubles of his loved ones and fellow beings.\n\nThis verse encourages us to embrace laborious work and find satisfaction in it, rather than seeking immediate gratification or pleasure. It highlights the virtue of hard work, self-sacrifice and service to others. It portrays the individual who practices these principles as a pillar - a symbol of strength and reliability that can bear the weight of others' sufferings and help in eliminating them.\n\nThe cultural context of this verse lies in the ancient Tamil society's emphasis on community, hard work, and service to others. The verse encourages individuals to be selfless, work hard, and contribute towards the wellbeing of their community.\n\nIn essence, the verse imparts the moral teaching that pleasure derived from selfless work and service to others is more rewarding than personal gains. A person who embodies this principle stands as a source of strength and solace for their loved ones and community, helping to alleviate their troubles..The kural verse:முயற்சி திருவினை ஆக்கும் முயற்றின்மைஇன்மை புகுத்தி விடும். ,translates to :Industry adds prosperity Indolence brings but poverty,and it's explantion is :Kural 616 emphasizes the importance of effort and labor in achieving prosperity and warns against the pitfalls of idleness. It states that diligent work is the key to wealth creation, while a lack of effort leads to impoverishment.\n\nThe verse underscores the fundamental principle that success is largely dependent on the amount of effort one puts into their endeavor. Hard work can elevate one's status and bring prosperity, whereas idleness or lack of effort can lead to poverty and destitution. This principle holds true not just for material wealth, but for all aspects of life where growth and progress are sought.\n\nMoreover, the Kural suggests that labor is a form of worship or devotion, capable of bringing divine blessings in the form of wealth. On the other hand, idleness is seen as a state of inertia that drags one towards poverty and hardship.\n\nThis Kural, therefore, encourages individuals to embrace hard work and shun laziness for a prosperous and fulfilling life. It emphasizes that one's actions and efforts directly influence their outcomes, a timeless principle that holds relevance even today..The kural verse:மடியுளாள் மாமுகடி என்ப மடியிலான்தாளுளான் தாமரையி னாள். ,translates to :Illuck abides with sloth they say *Laxmi's gifts with labourers stay *Laxmi the Goddes of wealth and prosperity,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural highlights the significant role of effort and industriousness in achieving prosperity, against the backdrop of two Hindu goddesses - Mudevi, the goddess of adversity or misfortune, and Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity.\n\nThe verse metaphorically states that Mudevi, often associated with laziness and inactivity, finds her abode in the lives of those who are idle and unproductive. In contrast, Lakshmi, symbolizing prosperity, blesses those who are industrious and diligent in their work.\n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes that laziness breeds adversity while hard work brings prosperity. It underscores the vital principle of karma, where one's actions determine their fate. If one is lazy and unproductive, they are likely to face hardships, symbolized by the presence of Mudevi. On the other hand, those who work hard and diligently are likely to be rewarded with prosperity, symbolized by the blessings of Lakshmi.\n\nThe cultural context of this verse is tied to the Hindu belief system, where deities are often invoked to symbolize different aspects of human life and behavior. However, the moral lesson it offers - the importance of hard work and the pitfalls of laziness - is universal and timeless. It encourages individuals to take responsibility for their lives, to strive and work hard for their goals, and not to succumb to idleness or complacency..The kural verse:பொறியின்மை யார்க்கும் பழியன்று அறிவறிந்துஆள்வினை இன்மை பழி. ,translates to :Misfortune is disgrace to none The shame is nothing learnt or done,and it's explantion is :Kural 618 emphasizes the importance of knowledge and effort. It argues that an unfortunate fate or adverse circumstances are not a disgrace to anyone but rather an aspect of life that can affect anyone. The uncontrollable factors in life should not be a cause for shame or embarrassment. \n\nHowever, the Kural suggests that not making an effort to improve one's situation and not seeking knowledge is indeed a disgrace. This implies a lack of initiative, a lack of drive, and a disregard for personal growth, which are considered far more detrimental than any unfortunate circumstance one might face.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar underscores the importance of self-improvement, initiative, and the pursuit of knowledge. He suggests that these are the things that are truly in our control, unlike fate, and that we should focus on these aspects to live a dignified life. \n\nThe Kural encourages us to take control of our lives, to seek knowledge diligently, and to make an effort in all our endeavors, as these are the true markers of a person's character and worth, and not the circumstances that they might find themselves in due to fate. \n\nTherefore, the real disgrace, according to Thiruvalluvar, is not in facing adversity, but in failing to learn, grow, and act in the face of such adversity..The kural verse:தெய்வத்தான் ஆகா தெனினும் முயற்சிதன்மெய்வருத்தக் கூலி தரும். ,translates to :Though fate is against fulfilment Hard labour has ready payment,and it's explantion is :This particular Kural, verse 619, emphasizes the power and significance of hard work and perseverance. Even when the desired outcome seems unattainable, and even though it may appear that fate or divine intervention is against one's efforts, the verse suggests that the exertion of effort and labour will not go unrewarded.\n\nThe verse proposes that the hard work itself, and the bodily exertion that comes with it, has an intrinsic value that will yield its own reward. This could be interpreted as both a physical and a spiritual reward: physically, in the sense of the accomplishment that comes from hard work and determination; and spiritually, in the sense of the personal growth and development that comes from persevering in the face of adversity.\n\nThis verse encourages individuals to persist in their endeavours, despite any obstacles they may face. It suggests that no effort is truly wasted, and that every struggle carries with it the potential for reward. In essence, it is a call to resilience and perseverance, and a testament to the power of hard work..The kural verse:ஊழையும் உப்பக்கம் காண்பர் உலைவின்றித்தாழாது உஞற்று பவர். ,translates to :Tireless Toiler's striving hand Shall leave even the fate behind,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse emphasizes the power of relentless effort and perseverance. It suggests that those who work tirelessly, without fear or hesitation, will eventually overcome fate, which is often considered an insurmountable force.\n\nThe term \"fate\" or \"destiny\" (often referred to as \"ஊழ்\" in Tamil) is generally perceived as a predefined path or outcome that cannot be changed or defeated. However, this Kural challenges that notion by asserting that even fate can be put behind one's back through persistent effort.\n\nThe underlying message is that of human resilience and courage. It encourages individuals not to be deterred by the challenges that come their way and to continue striving without losing heart. It emphasizes that no external force, including fate, can deter a determined soul from achieving its goal.\n\nThe verse embodies the spirit of resilience, determination, and the ability to shape one's own destiny through hard work and perseverance. It serves as a reminder that we should not succumb to the concept of fate but strive to surpass it with our efforts..The kural verse:இடுக்கண் வருங்கால் நகுக அதனைஅடுத்தூர்வது அஃதொப்ப தில். ,translates to :Laugh away troubles; there is No other way to conquer woes,and it's explantion is :Kural 621 encourages resilience in the face of adversity. It implores us to meet troubles with a smile, as it is the most effective way to dispel sorrow. Instead of brooding over hardship, we should maintain a cheerful disposition, which can significantly diminish the impact of the trouble.\n\nThis verse emphasizes the power of a positive attitude that can help one conquer the hardest of times. A smile or a laugh, in this context, does not merely represent physical expressions but symbolizes an inner state of happiness and acceptance. It is about maintaining an unfaltering spirit and finding joy, even in the most challenging circumstances.\n\nThe wisdom of the verse lies in its subtle reminder that suffering is a part of life, and our reaction to it determines our ability to cope with it. By choosing to \"laugh\" at our troubles, we are not dismissing them, but we are taking away their power to bring us down.\n\nIn essence, this Kural teaches us that the best way to overcome adversity is to face it with a positive and undeterred spirit. There's no better strategy to defeat sorrow than to counter it with happiness and a smile..The kural verse:வெள்ளத் தனைய இடும்பை அறிவுடையான்உள்ளத்தின் உள்ளக் கெடும். ,translates to :Deluging sorrows come to nought When wise men face them with firm thought,and it's explantion is :Kural 622 emphasizes the power of wisdom and courageous thinking even during times of distress. It compares adversities to a flood, which is an overwhelming natural disaster, but suggests that even such a colossal trouble can be overcome by wise and courageous thoughts.\n\nThe verse signifies that the mind of a wise person, even when engulfed by sorrows or problems as vast as a flood, will not succumb to despair. Instead, it will contemplate on ways to overcome the predicament. The wisdom of such a person enables them to gauge the depth of the problem and strategize a solution accordingly. This mental fortitude and strategic thinking eventually leads to the problem receding and disappearing, just like a flood eventually subsides.\n\nIn essence, this verse teaches us about the importance of resilience and resourcefulness in the face of adversity. It encourages us to face our problems with courage and wisdom, rather than succumbing to despair or fear. It reassures us that every problem, no matter how large, can be overcome with the right mindset and strategy..The kural verse:இடும்பைக்கு இடும்பை படுப்பர் இடும்பைக்குஇடும்பை படாஅ தவர். ,translates to :Grief they face and put to grief Who grieve not grief by mind's relief,and it's explantion is :Kural 623 is a reflection on resilience and the power of maintaining a positive mindset even in the face of adversity. The verse suggests that those who do not succumb to sorrow during times of hardship essentially \"give sorrow to sorrow\". This means that they overcome their struggles and turn their misfortune into an opportunity to grow and succeed. \n\nThis kural emphasizes the importance of resilience and the ability to cope with difficulties. It suggests that those who do not let their troubles overpower them, but rather face them head-on, can turn their hardships into a source of strength. They do this by not letting their spirits be dampened by their troubles, and by using their challenges as stepping stones towards victory. \n\nIn essence, this verse encourages us to adopt a positive mindset in the face of hardship. It suggests that we should not allow our difficulties to bring us down, but instead use them as a catalyst to strengthen our resolve and achieve success. This is a powerful message of resilience, strength, and the power of a positive outlook. \n\nIn cultural context, the Thiru Kural often draws upon universal human experiences and values, and this verse is no different. It speaks to the human capacity for resilience and the ability to overcome adversity, which is a universally applicable and inspiring message. It encourages us to face our difficulties with courage and determination, and to not let them bring us down..The kural verse:மடுத்தவா யெல்லாம் பகடன்னான் உற்றஇடுக்கண் இடர்ப்பாடு உடைத்து. ,translates to :Who pulls like bulls patiently on Causes grief to grieve anon,and it's explantion is :The Kural 624 emphasizes the power of relentless effort and resilience in the face of adversity. It conveys that if a person continues to struggle against difficulties without giving up, even the most formidable troubles will crumble and eventually disappear.\n\nThe verse uses the metaphor of an ox pulling a heavily loaded cart across a rough path. Just like the ox that continues to pull the load with unyielding determination, a person who faces adversities with such relentless effort can cause the hardships themselves to feel troubled and eventually vanish.\n\nThe Kural thus encourages the virtue of perseverance and tenacity. It suggests that no matter how tough the challenge is, one should not shy away from it but confront it with unwavering determination and resilience. The hardships will then lose their power and one can overcome them triumphantly.\n\nIn essence, the Kural teaches that relentless effort and courage in the face of adversity can make even the toughest troubles disappear. It is a powerful message of hope, resilience, and the indomitable human spirit..The kural verse:அடுக்கி வரினும் அழிவிலான் உற்றஇடுக்கண் இடுக்கட் படும். ,translates to :Before the brave grief grieves and goes Who dare a host of pressing woes,and it's explantion is :Kural 625 emphasizes the power of resilience and tenacity in the face of difficulties. This verse states that if a person stands firm and unshaken, irrespective of the hardships that keep coming at him, those hardships themselves will eventually be defeated and disappear.\n\nThe underlying principle here is the strength of the human will and the power of perseverance. Despite the density or intensity of the problems one faces, if one does not yield or abandon their purpose, the troubles themselves will start to weaken and crumble. It is a reflection of the philosophy that troubles persist only till they are fed with fear and despair. Once confronted with unwavering determination, they lose their power and dissipate.\n\nThis verse advocates for unwavering courage and mental robustness. It encourages us to stay resolute and steadfast in the face of adversities, and assures that with such an attitude, no trouble is unconquerable. This is a timeless message that holds true across cultures and ages, and is particularly relevant in times of crisis or difficulty.\n\nIn essence, Thirukkural 625 teaches us that the key to overcoming one's troubles is to face them with unwavering courage and resolve, for it is such resilience that will eventually bring about the downfall of the troubles themselves..The kural verse:அற்றேமென்று அல்லற் படுபவோ பெற்றேமென்றுஓம்புதல் தேற்றா தவர். ,translates to :The wise that never gloat in gain Do not fret in fateful ruin,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural talks about the virtue of generosity and the perception of wealth. It asks a rhetorical question whether those who, during their prosperous times, don't cling to their wealth with excessive attachment and freely share it with others, would ever lament \"we are destitute\" during periods of adversity or loss.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that those who understand the transitory nature of wealth and do not hoard it out of greed, but instead use it to help others, will not be overly distressed or grieve during times of financial hardship. They won't cry out in despair, because they understand that wealth comes and goes, and the real value lies not in hoarding it, but in using it for good deeds.\n\nThe underlying moral of this verse is to encourage the act of giving and discourage greed. It conveys the message that wealth should serve as a means to help and support others, rather than being an end in itself. It also highlights that the individuals who understand and follow this principle will be able to face adversity without despair, as they realize the impermanent nature of material wealth..The kural verse:இலக்கம் உடம்பிடும்பைக் கென்று கலக்கத்தைக்கையாறாக் கொள்ளாதாம் மேல். ,translates to :The wise worry no more of woes Knowing body's butt of sorrows,and it's explantion is :The Kural 627 emphasizes the wisdom of understanding the inherent nature of the human body to experience trouble or discomfort. The verse encourages a philosophical perspective, suggesting that wise and enlightened individuals do not regard physical troubles as a cause for distress or anxiety.\n\nThe human body, by its very nature, is prone to discomfort and disease. This is a fundamental truth, a part of the human condition. Those who understand this, the 'great' as referred to in the verse, do not panic or get distressed when they face physical trouble. They accept it as something natural and inherent to the physical existence.\n\nThis verse encourages a stoic approach to life's troubles. It suggests that we should not let physical discomfort unduly disturb our mental peace. Instead, we should accept it as a normal part of life. This acceptance helps us to maintain our composure and equanimity even in the face of trouble.\n\nThe verse also subtly hints at the impermanent and transient nature of physical existence. It advocates an attitude of detachment and acceptance, which can help us navigate through life's challenges with grace and resilience. \n\nIn summary, Kural 627 teaches us to have a realistic understanding of the human body's susceptibility to discomfort and to bear such discomfort with equanimity and courage..The kural verse:இன்பம் விழையான் இடும்பை இயல்பென்பான்துன்பம் உறுதல் இலன். ,translates to :Who seek not joy, deem grief norm By sorrows do not come to harm,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 628, emphasizes the importance of not seeking pleasure and accepting distress as a part of life. \n\nThe verse suggests that a person who does not actively chase after pleasures is less likely to experience sorrow. This is because the pursuit of pleasure often leads to attachment and desire, which in turn causes disappointment and suffering when these pleasures are lost or unattained. \n\nFurthermore, the verse also conveys the wisdom of accepting distress or sorrow as a natural part of human existence. Life is a mix of both happiness and sorrow, and accepting this reality helps individuals to maintain a balanced state of mind, regardless of the circumstances they find themselves in. \n\nIn essence, the verse encourages a sense of detachment and acceptance, which can lead to a state of contentment and peace, free from the highs and lows of joy and sorrow. This aligns with the core principles of many philosophical and spiritual traditions, which advocate for equanimity and acceptance of life as it is..The kural verse:இன்பத்துள் இன்பம் விழையாதான் துன்பத்துள்துன்பம் உறுதல் இலன். ,translates to :In joy to joy who is not bound In grief he grieves not dual round!,and it's explantion is :Kural 629 emphasizes the importance of equanimity or balanced mind in both joy and sorrow. It states that the person who does not overly indulge or become excessively attached to pleasure when it occurs, will not be deeply affected or suffer when faced with sorrow or pain. \n\nThis verse is a reminder to maintain a composed and steady mind regardless of the circumstances. It encourages individuals to not get overly excited or overly despondent with the ups and downs of life. By doing so, one can ensure that the pleasure does not control them, and similarly, sorrow does not cause them undue suffering. \n\nIn essence, the verse promotes the philosophy of detachment and balance, which is a common theme in many spiritual and philosophical traditions. It suggests that while we cannot always control what happens to us, we can control our reactions to these events, thereby reducing the impact of sorrow and enhancing our overall well-being..The kural verse:இன்னாமை இன்பம் எனக்கொளின் ஆகுந்தன்ஒன்னார் விழையுஞ் சிறப்பு. ,translates to :His glory is esteemed by foes Who sees weal in wanton woes!,and it's explantion is :Kural 630 emphasizes the strength of character and resilience. It suggests that if one can perceive difficulties or pain as pleasure or a learning experience, they will attain a level of respect and admiration, even from their enemies. \n\nThis Kural provides a unique perspective on how one should deal with hardship. By viewing pain as pleasure, one not only transcends the immediate discomfort but also cultivates a mental fortitude that is admirable. This mental strength allows one to face any challenges head-on, without being deterred by the fear of pain or failure.\n\nThe verse also subtly implies that the ability to reinterpret a negative situation positively is a mark of exceptional character. Such a person will be respected and esteemed by everyone, even by those who oppose them. It underscores the importance of maintaining a positive outlook in life, regardless of the circumstances. \n\nIn a broader perspective, this Kural encourages us to embrace life's challenges and use them as stepping stones towards personal growth and development. The respect and admiration that follow are natural by-products of this attitude. \n\nIn essence, Kural 630 extols the virtues of resilience, mental fortitude, and a positive outlook, which are universally admired and respected qualities..The kural verse:கருவியும் காலமும் செய்கையும் செய்யும்அருவினையும் மாண்டது அமைச்சு. ,translates to :He is minister who chooses Right means, time, mode and rare ventures,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural speaks about the qualities of an efficient minister or administrator.

A good minister knows how to utilize these resources efficiently to achieve the desired outcome. \n\nTiming is also a critical factor in administration. An efficient minister recognizes the right moment to initiate a task or a project, understanding that the success of any undertaking often hinges on its timing.\n\nThe method of execution is another important aspect. A good minister knows not just what needs to be done, but how it should be done. They can devise effective strategies and procedures to ensure that tasks are carried out smoothly and effectively.\n\nLastly, the verse also emphasizes the ability to handle complex tasks. A capable minister is not daunted by the complexity or difficulty of a task.

He should be equipped with knowledge, courage, commitment, and unwavering firmness to effectively lead and protect his people..The kural verse:பிரித்தலும் பேணிக் கொளலும் பிரிந்தார்ப்பொருத்தலும் வல்ல தமைச்சு. ,translates to :A minister cherishes friends Divides foes and the parted blends,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the essential qualities of a competent minister or advisor. According to the verse, a capable minister is one who can skillfully create discord among enemies, effectively maintain the goodwill and loyalty of his allies, and has the ability to reconcile with those who have separated from him, thereby bringing them back into the fold.\n\nThe first quality, creating discord among enemies, refers to the strategic ability of the minister to weaken the enemy's forces by sowing seeds of dissent among them. This is an essential quality for a minister in order to protect his own country or organization from external threats.\n\nThe second quality, maintaining the goodwill of his allies, speaks of the importance of nurturing healthy relationships within one's own group. A minister must ensure the unity and morale of his own people to maintain a strong and stable administration.\n\nThe third quality, reconciling with those who have separated, highlights the minister's diplomatic skills to mend broken relationships and restore alliances. This could apply both internally, within the organization, and externally, in dealing with other groups or nations.\n\nOverall, the verse provides a blueprint for what makes an effective minister - strategic acumen, relationship management, and diplomacy. It emphasizes that a minister's strength lies not just in dealing with external threats, but also in managing internal relationships and maintaining unity and harmony..The kural verse:தெரிதலும் தேர்ந்து செயலும் ஒருதலையாச்சொல்லலும் வல்லது அமைச்சு. ,translates to :A minister must sift reflect Select and say surely one fact,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural talks about the qualities of an ideal minister or advisor. According to the verse, such a person should possess three specific capabilities:\n\n1.

This includes understanding the complexities, potential challenges, and the expected outcomes. This understanding will help in making informed decisions and planning strategically.\n\n2. Execution: Apart from understanding, the minister should also be capable of executing the task in the most efficient and effective manner. This involves devising the right strategies, making use of resources wisely, and ensuring that the task is completed successfully.\n\n3.

It suggests that there is no obstacle or challenge that can withstand the force of a person who possesses both inherent acuity and scholarly learning.\n\nThe first line refers to \"natural acuity in addition to learning\". This implies a combination of innate intelligence and formal education or learned knowledge. In the context of Thiru Kural, \"natural acuity\" can be seen as intuitive understanding, quick thinking, or natural talent. The second part, \"learning\", refers to acquired knowledge, wisdom gained through education or personal experiences.\n\nThe second line asks rhetorically about the existence of any contrivances or strategies that can resist such individuals. The rhetorical question implies that no matter how complex or intricate a challenge or problem might be, it cannot withstand the combined power of natural intellect and learned knowledge.\n\nIn essence, the Kural emphasizes the potency of a blend of inherent intellect and learned knowledge. It encourages individuals to seek education and wisdom, while also honing and trusting their innate intelligence. It assures that those who incorporate their natural wit with their learned wisdom can overcome any obstacle and achieve their goals, no matter how formidable the challenges may seem..The kural verse:செயற்கை அறிந்தக் கடைத்தும் உலகத்துஇயற்கை அறிந்து செயல். ,translates to :Albeit you know to act from books Act after knowing world's outlooks,and it's explantion is :Kural 637 emphasizes the importance of understanding and adapting to the practical realities and norms of the world, even when one is well-versed in the theoretical aspects of a task or action. The verse advises that while theoretical knowledge is essential, it is equally important to comprehend the practical nuances and methods of the world. One should not just rely on theoretical knowledge but also understand the ways of the world and adjust their actions accordingly. \n\nIt implies that wisdom is not just about acquiring knowledge but also about applying it in a way that is pragmatic and aligned with the world's realities. It suggests a balance between theory and practice, between knowledge and wisdom, and between ideals and realities. This verse encourages practical wisdom, which involves applying theoretical knowledge in real-world contexts in a way that is effective and appropriate. \n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse also underscores the importance of cultural sensitivity and context awareness.

Even if the king lacks knowledge and understanding, the minister's responsibility is to provide him with sound and wise advice. His duty does not waver, regardless of the king's ignorance or reluctance to listen.\n\nThis verse suggests that the success of a kingdom doesn't solely depend on the king's wisdom but also on the guidance he receives from his ministers. The minister must possess the courage to speak the truth and guide the king in the right direction, regardless of the king's initial resistance or ignorance.\n\nIn broader interpretation, this Kural underscores the importance of having informed advisors or consultants in any decision-making process, be it in governance, business, or personal life.

The verse, in simple English, suggests that it is far better for a king to have seventy crores of enemies than to have a dishonest minister by his side. In essence, a deceitful minister who is only focused on his own gain rather than the welfare of the kingdom can cause more harm than millions of enemies.\n\nThe minister is a key figure in the administration of a kingdom. He is supposed to provide valuable advice, help in decision-making, and contribute significantly to maintaining the welfare of the kingdom. However, if such a person harbors ill-intentions and plans the downfall of the king or the state, the damage he can inflict is enormous. He has the power to destabilize the kingdom from within, which is far more dangerous than an external threat.\n\nIn the broader perspective, this verse also advocates for honesty, loyalty, and the importance of righteous conduct in positions of power and influence. It warns of the grave danger that can be posed by deceit and personal greed, especially when it comes from someone close and trusted..The kural verse:முறைப்படச் சூழ்ந்தும் முடிவிலவே செய்வர்திறப்பாடு இலாஅ தவர். ,translates to :The unresolved, though well designed To fulfil an act they have no mind,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural emphasizes the importance of execution ability in leadership roles, especially that of ministers or administrators.\n\nThe verse states that even if these individuals have planned their tasks meticulously, their efforts will fall short if they lack the execution skills. They might have the best of intentions and the most well-thought-out plans, but without the ability to execute these plans efficiently, they would end up delivering half-baked results.\n\nIn essence, the verse underlines the fact that planning and execution are two sides of the same coin. While planning is certainly important, it is execution that ultimately determines the success or failure of a plan. Therefore, it is crucial for those in leadership positions to possess not just strategic and planning skills, but also the ability to carry out their plans effectively. \n\nThis teaching is not only relevant to political or administrative contexts but also applies to various other aspects of life, including personal goals, business strategies, or any project management scenario. It highlights the value of practical skills in addition to theoretical knowledge, thus promoting a balanced approach towards accomplishing tasks..The kural verse:நாநலம் என்னும் நலனுடைமை அந்நலம்யாநலத்து உள்ளதூஉம் அன்று. ,translates to :The goodness called goodness of speech Is goodness which nothing can reach,and it's explantion is :Kural 641 emphasizes the supreme value of eloquence or the power of effective speech. This verse essentially says that the goodness of articulate and persuasive speech, referred to as 'Naanalum', surpasses all other forms of goodness, making it the most precious wealth one can possess. \n\nThis Kural suggests that eloquent speech is not just a personal benefit but it also benefits others, making it more valuable than any material wealth. The power of eloquence lies in its ability to convey ideas and emotions effectively, to persuade, to inspire, and to bring about change. It's a tool that can be used to educate, to resolve conflicts, to negotiate, and to achieve a multitude of other outcomes.\n\nIn the cultural context, the Thirukural often highlights the importance of speech, emphasizing that it should be truthful, kind, and helpful. This verse takes it a step further, suggesting the mastery of speech as a form of goodness in itself, which has the power to surpass all other forms of goodness. Therefore, developing the ability to communicate effectively and articulately is seen as an invaluable asset..The kural verse:ஆக்கமுங் கேடும் அதனால் வருதலால்காத்தோம்பல் சொல்லின்கட் சோர்வு. ,translates to :Since gain or ruin speeches bring Guard against the slips of tongue,and it's explantion is :Kural 642 emphasizes the importance of mindful speech, particularly for those in positions of power and influence like ministers.

Therefore, it is vital for people, especially those entrusted with the responsibility of advising or governing others, to exercise caution in their speech. \n\nThey should guard against any flaw or error in their words as faulty speech can lead to unfortunate consequences. The verse highlights the need for careful thought before speaking, promoting the idea of mindful communication. This principle is not only applicable to ministers but to everyone, as our words hold the power to shape our lives and the world around us. \n\nThis verse also underscores the belief in the power of the spoken word prevalent in Tamil culture and many other cultures worldwide. The verse suggests that wise and careful speech can lead to prosperity, while careless or harmful words can lead to downfall or disaster. Therefore, it encourages individuals to be mindful of their words, speaking thoughtfully and responsibly..The kural verse:கேட்டார்ப் பிணிக்கும் தகையவாய்க் கேளாரும்வேட்ப மொழிவதாம் சொல். ,translates to :A speech is speech that holds ears And attracts ev'n those that are averse,and it's explantion is :Kural 643 speaks about the power of a minister's or a leader's words. According to this Kural, the true effectiveness of a leader's speech lies in its ability to bind friends closer and also to attract those who are not yet friends or even considered enemies. In other words, his words should be persuasive, insightful, and appealing, leading everyone who hears them to appreciate and seek his friendship.\n\nThis Kural emphasizes the importance of diplomacy and tact in leadership. A leader's words should not only strengthen existing bonds but also be capable of mending fences and extending friendships. The essence of this Kural is that skillful communication can turn potential adversaries into allies, and solidify existing relationships, an attribute that is crucial in leadership.\n\nThe communication referred to here goes beyond mere eloquence. It requires deep understanding, wisdom and empathy to be able to connect with a diverse range of people. This Kural is a timeless principle applicable to leaders in all fields, from politics to business, from community organization to international diplomacy..The kural verse:திறனறிந்து சொல்லுக சொல்லை அறனும்பொருளும் அதனினூஉங்கு இல். ,translates to :Weigh thy words and speak; because  No wealth or virtue words surpass,and it's explantion is :Kural 644 emphasizes the importance of thoughtful communication. It advises one to understand the character, background, education, ethics, wealth, appearance, and age of the listener before speaking. This kural underlines that effective communication is not just about conveying your thoughts but also about considering the listener's perspective and their ability to comprehend your message. \n\nThe verse highlights that there is nothing superior to the skill of delivering the right speech to the right person at the right time, not even virtue or wealth. This means that the ability to communicate effectively, considering your listener's attributes, is more valuable than any material wealth or moral virtue.\n\nThe essence of this kural is that understanding your audience and framing your words accordingly is a significant skill. It's a subtle art that can lead to more effective communication, better relationships, and overall success in various aspects of life..The kural verse:சொல்லுக சொல்லைப் பிறிதோர்சொல் அச்சொல்லைவெல்லுஞ்சொல் இன்மை அறிந்து. ,translates to :Speak out thy world so that no word Can win it and say untoward,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of thoughtful communication.

This verse is a part of the Thirukkural's chapter on the 'Qualities of a Minister' and outlines two fundamental aspects of effective communication: speaking in a manner that engages the listener and comprehending the essence of what others convey.\n\nThe first part of the verse emphasizes that a minister should speak in a way that not only captivates his listeners but also inspires them to want to hear more. This involves the use of eloquence, wit, clarity, and a keen understanding of the audience's interests and needs. It underlines the significance of not just being a speaker, but an engaging one.\n\nThe second part of the verse underscores the importance of active listening. It suggests that a minister should be adept at understanding and deriving the intended meaning and utility from what others say. This requires patience, focus, analytical thinking, and an open mind.\n\nIn essence, the verse extols those who are free from defects in diplomacy, meaning those who are proficient in both articulating their thoughts effectively and interpreting others' speeches accurately. These qualities are deemed vital for anyone in a position of influence, such as a minister, as they facilitate better decision-making and foster harmonious relationships..The kural verse:சொலல்வல்லன் சோர்விலன் அஞ்சான் அவனைஇகல்வெல்லல் யார்க்கும் அரிது. ,translates to :No foe defies the speaker clear Flawless, puissant, and free from fear,and it's explantion is :The Kural 647 emphasizes the strength of an individual who is eloquent in speech, fearless, and untiring. This person is said to be unbeatable by any trickery or deceit. \n\nThe verse underlines three essential qualities of a strong individual. Firstly, the ability to articulate thoughts, ideas, and feelings clearly and effectively. This skill allows us to communicate with others fluently and persuasively, garnering respect and understanding. Secondly, the verse highlights the importance of being fearless. Fearlessness signifies the courage to face adversity without retreating, demonstrating resilience and determination. Lastly, it highlights the trait of tirelessness, indicating a person's ability to persist in their efforts, regardless of the challenges or obstacles they face.\n\nThus, the verse communicates that a person possessing these three qualities - eloquence, fearlessness, and tirelessness - is virtually unconquerable by any form of scheming or plotting by others. This is because the person's communication skills can counteract deception, their fearlessness can withstand intimidation, and their tirelessness ensures they will not succumb to fatigue or give up easily. \n\nIn essence, the verse extols the virtues of communication, courage, and perseverance, portraying them as shields against any form of manipulation or deceit. Such individuals, the verse implies, are invincible in the face of intrigue or conspiracy..The kural verse:விரைந்து தொழில்கேட்கும் ஞாலம் நிரந்தினிதுசொல்லுதல் வல்லார்ப் பெறின். ,translates to :The world will quickly carry out The words of counsellors astute,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 648, speaks about the power of articulate and organized communication. Valluvar asserts here that if someone is adept in articulating thoughts in an orderly and appealing manner, they are readily accepted and sought after by society.\n\nThe underlying principle is the importance of effective communication. It's not just about what we say, but also how we say it. The ability to present thoughts in a structured, coherent, and engaging manner is a valuable skill that can make a person influential in their societal or professional circles.\n\nThe verse also subtly introduces the idea of adaptability. If one can speak about 'various subjects', it means they have a broad knowledge base and the adaptability to address different topics. This flexibility, combined with eloquence, can make a person's words more appealing to a larger audience.\n\nIn essence, Valluvar is emphasizing the power of good communication skills and how they can lead to societal acceptance and influence. This is a timeless concept, as relevant today in our world of public speaking, presentations, and media, as it was when Valluvar penned it centuries ago..The kural verse:பலசொல்லக் காமுறுவர் மன்றமா சற்றசிலசொல்லல் தேற்றா தவர். ,translates to :They overspeak who do not seek A few and flawless words to speak,and it's explantion is :Kural 649 emphasizes the significance of precision and clarity in communication. Thiruvalluvar, the poet, suggests that those who struggle to express their thoughts succinctly and accurately tend to use an excess of words. This tendency is often born out of an inability to articulate their ideas with a few precise and flawless words.\n\nThis verse underscores the importance of effective communication skills, particularly brevity and clarity. It suggests that verbosity or excessive use of words is not a sign of knowledge or wisdom. Instead, it might indicate a lack of understanding or inability to articulate thoughts clearly and succinctly. \n\nThis Kural, therefore, advises one to focus on the quality of their speech rather than the quantity. It promotes the idea that one's words should be carefully chosen, meaningful, precise, and free from errors. It is a reminder that eloquence lies not in the amount of words used, but in the ability to convey one's thoughts effectively with fewer, faultless words..The kural verse:இணருழ்த்தும் நாறா மலரனையர் கற்றதுஉணர விரித்துரையா தார். ,translates to :Who can't express what they have learnt Are bunch of flowers not fragrant,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of effective communication of one's knowledge. The verse metaphorically compares people who lack the ability to articulate their learned knowledge to \"flowers that bloom in a cluster but lack fragrance\". Just as a flower's true value comes not just from its beauty but also its fragrance, a person's worth is not just in the knowledge they possess, but in their ability to effectively communicate, share, and apply that knowledge.\n\nIn the cultural context, the Thiru Kural is emphasizing the principle of shared knowledge and wisdom. In ancient Tamil society, as in many other cultures, knowledge was considered a communal asset, something to be shared for the betterment of society.\n\nIn a moral interpretation, the verse is urging individuals to strive not just for personal learning and development, but also for the skill to communicate and share that knowledge with others. The verse suggests that knowledge kept to oneself and not shared or applied is of little value, just like a flower that lacks fragrance. It encourages the cultivation of communication skills along with the pursuit of knowledge. Knowledge, when shared and communicated effectively, can enlighten and benefit others, amplifying its value..The kural verse:துணைநலம் ஆக்கம் த்ருஉம் வினைநலம்வேண்டிய எல்லாந் தரும். ,translates to :Friendship brings gain; but action pure Does every good thing we desire,and it's explantion is :This Kural, number 651, speaks about the power of action and the benefits of having good allies or support. The verse points out that having supportive allies can indeed bring prosperity or wealth, but it is the quality and efficacy of one's own actions that will yield all that one desires. \n\nBy this verse, Thiruvalluvar emphasizes the importance of individual effort and action over dependency on others. While good support can provide material wealth, it is ultimately one's own actions that determine the variety of benefits one can attain, including those beyond material wealth. It implies that personal initiative, diligence, and perseverance in action are critical to achieving comprehensive success and fulfilling all desires. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse also encourages self-reliance, hard work, and the power of personal efforts in shaping one's life, destiny, and the attainment of desired goals. It underlines the philosophy that while external support is beneficial, it is our actions that truly shape our outcomes..The kural verse:என்றும் ஒருவுதல் வேண்டும் புகழொடுநன்றி பயவா வினை. ,translates to :Eschew always acts that do not  Bring good nor glory on their part,and it's explantion is :Kural 652 emphasizes the importance of actions that not only bring fame, but also yield benefits for the future. It advises ministers, or leaders in general, to always avoid engaging in actions that, despite bringing them temporary fame or recognition, do not yield any lasting benefits or contribute positively to the future.\n\nIn other words, this verse advocates for long-term thinking and ethical conduct. It suggests that our actions should always be beneficial, not just for the present moment, but also for the future. Furthermore, they should be morally sound and bring us good repute.\n\nThis Kural, like many others in the Thirukkural, highlights the importance of ethical conduct and foresight in leadership. It serves as a reminder that leaders should not be swayed by the lure of instant fame or recognition, but should instead focus on actions that yield lasting benefits and enhance their reputation in the long run..The kural verse:ஒஓதல் வேண்டும் ஒளிமாழ்கும் செய்வினைஆஅதும் என்னு மவர். ,translates to :Those in the world desire for fame Should shun the deed that dims their name,and it's explantion is :Kural 653 emphasizes the importance of maintaining one's reputation while striving for self-improvement and growth. Those who aspire to elevate themselves, in terms of personal or professional growth, should be cautious not to engage in actions that might tarnish their reputation or credibility. The pursuit of growth and betterment should not come at the cost of one's honor and dignity.\n\nIn other words, aspiring for progress is commendable, but it should be done with moral integrity and ethical conduct. Any actions that could potentially damage one's reputation should be avoided. This principle is relevant in all spheres of life, including personal relationships, professional endeavors, and societal interactions. \n\nThe verse underscores the value of good character and the necessity to uphold it while striving for progress and success. It teaches us that true growth is not just about achieving higher status or wealth, but also about maintaining our good name and integrity..The kural verse:இடுக்கண் படினும் இளிவந்த செய்யார்நடுக்கற்ற காட்சி யவர். ,translates to :Though perils press the faultless wise Shun deeds of mean, shameful device,and it's explantion is :This Kural (verse 654) emphasizes the importance of good judgment and integrity, even in the face of adversity or personal danger. It suggests that individuals who possess clear and infallible judgment will not engage in disgraceful acts, even if they are under threat or experiencing hardship. This is because their sound judgment allows them to understand the long-term implications of their actions. \n\nThe verse promotes the values of moral steadfastness and ethical decision-making. It implies that those who have experienced or learnt from the disgraceful acts of their predecessors will strive not to repeat the same mistakes, regardless of the challenges they face. This kind of prudent judgement is highly esteemed and considered a mark of wisdom.\n\nIn essence, this verse is a reminder that one's characters is truly tested in times of difficulty. Those who maintain their integrity even in perilous situations are the ones who possess true wisdom, according to Thiruvalluvar. Their commitment to doing what is right, irrespective of the circumstances, distinguishes them from others..The kural verse:எற்றென்று இரங்குவ செய்யற்க செய்வானேல்மற்றன்ன செய்யாமை நன்று. ,translates to :Do not wrong act and grieve, \\\"Alas\\\"  If done, do not repeat it twice,and it's explantion is :This Kural highlights the importance of careful action and the avoidance of regret in the role of a minister. According to it, a minister should never commit an act which he might later regret, thinking, \"what have I done?\" Such regret often arises from impulsive decisions or actions that are not well thought out, leading to unforeseen negative consequences.\n\nHowever, the Kural also acknowledges human fallibility and suggests that if a minister does commit such an act, the best course of action is to not repeat it. This implies learning from one's mistakes and ensuring they are not repeated in the future.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can be applied to anyone in a position of responsibility or authority. It advises prudence and foresight in decision-making, as well as the wisdom to learn from one's mistakes and avoid repeating them. This is a crucial aspect of good leadership and effective management..The kural verse:ஈன்றாள் பசிகாண்பான் ஆயினுஞ் செய்யற்கசான்றோர் பழிக்கும் வினை. ,translates to :Though she who begot thee hungers Shun acts denounced by ancient seers,and it's explantion is :Kural 656 is a profound verse that imparts a moral lesson on integrity and righteous behaviour. It essentially says, \"Even if one witnesses their mother suffering from hunger, they should not resort to dishonorable actions that would invite the scorn of the wise.\" \n\nThis Kural underlines the importance of upholding one's dignity and moral values, even in the face of dire circumstances. It stresses that desperate situations should not be used as an excuse for unethical actions, as these would only bring contempt from virtuous and learned people.\n\nThe mother's suffering mentioned in the verse symbolizes the extreme conditions that might push someone towards wrongful deeds. The verse strongly suggests that, irrespective of the severity of one's personal trials, maintaining righteousness should be paramount.\n\nIn brief, this verse from Thiru Kural teaches us that no matter how desperate our circumstances, we should always strive to uphold our ethics and dignity, avoiding actions that would be considered disgraceful by the virtuous..The kural verse:பழிமலைந்து எய்திய ஆக்கத்தின் சான்றோர்கழிநல் குரவே தலை. ,translates to :Pinching poverty of the wise Is more than wealth hoarded by Vice,and it's explantion is :Kural 657 discusses the distinction between wealth gained through wrongful means and the poverty experienced by the righteous. \n\nThe verse suggests that the abject poverty of those who are wise, just, and morally upright is far superior to the wealth amassed through sinful actions. The accumulation of wealth without the consideration of morality or ethics, according to Valluvar, leads to spiritual degradation and is therefore not desirable. \n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes the importance of moral and ethical behavior over materialistic wealth. It suggests that living a life of integrity, even if it entails poverty, is far more commendable than living a life of wealth obtained through dishonesty or sinful deeds. \n\nThe verse upholds the age-old wisdom that wealth does not equate to happiness or superiority if it is not earned through righteous means. Hence, it encourages individuals to prioritize morality, righteousness, and wisdom above material gains. \n\nIt's a reminder that wealth, when accumulated through unjust means, can lead to downfall and disgrace, whereas a life lived with integrity, irrespective of the financial status, always holds its head high in dignity..The kural verse:கடிந்த கடிந்தொரார் செய்தார்க்கு அவைதாம்முடிந்தாலும் பீழை தரும். ,translates to :Those who dare a forbidden deed Suffer troubles though they succeed,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse emphasizes the consequences of indulging in actions or deeds that are explicitly forbidden or discouraged by the wise and the learned. The verse suggests that even if such actions lead to temporary success or accomplishment, they will ultimately result in sorrow and regret. \n\nThe essence of this verse lies in the understanding that moral and ethical boundaries are not meant to restrict but to guide one's actions towards righteousness. When these boundaries, set by the learned and wise, are ignored or violated, the initial outcomes might appear beneficial. However, in the long run, they will lead to distress and unhappiness, reflecting the universal law of cause and effect.\n\nThis verse also underscores the importance of self-restraint and adherence to moral principles. It encourages individuals to refrain from engaging in activities deemed inappropriate or harmful by the wise, no matter how enticing they may appear. The temporary success achieved by such means will eventually lead to sorrow, thereby emphasizing the importance of ethical conduct for long-term peace and happiness..The kural verse:அழக்கொண்ட எல்லாம் அழப்போம் இழப்பினும்பிற்பயக்கும் நற்பா லவை. ,translates to :Gains from weeping, weeping go Though lost, from good deeds blessings flow,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse emphasizes the significance of fairness and morality in acquiring wealth or possessions. The first part of the verse, \"All that has been obtained with tears (to the victim) will depart with tears (to himself)\", indicates that if one acquires wealth by causing suffering or distress to others, that wealth will not stay with them for long. It suggests the concept of karma, where the suffering inflicted on others will eventually return to the inflictor, causing them to lose what they unjustly gained.\n\nThe second part of the verse, \"but what has been by fair means; though with loss at first, will afterwards yield fruit\", underscores the importance of righteous means in acquiring wealth. Even if one faces a loss initially, the wealth acquired through just and fair means will eventually bring benefits. This part of the verse highlights the enduring value of morality and fairness, suggesting that good actions might not always yield immediate rewards, but they are bound to bear fruit in the long run.\n\nOverall, this verse of Thiru Kural teaches us that wealth obtained through unjust means is ephemeral and fraught with sorrow, whereas wealth obtained through fair means, even if it seems less profitable initially, will yield lasting and fruitful results. It encourages us to uphold moral values and fairness in our endeavors, assuring us that righteousness will always lead to enduring prosperity..The kural verse:சலத்தால் பொருள்செய்தே மார்த்தல் பசுமண்கலத்துள்நீர் பெய்திரீஇ யற்று. ,translates to :The wealth gathered in guilty ways Is water poured in wet clay vase,and it's explantion is :This Kural is about the ethical responsibilities of a minister in governing a kingdom. The verse metaphorically illustrates the consequences of protecting a ruler using wealth obtained through unethical means.\n\nThe analogy that Thiruvalluvar uses here is of a vessel made of wet clay. Just as filling such a vessel with water will lead to its disintegration rather than its preservation, similarly, a kingdom sustained by ill-gotten wealth will eventually break down rather than thrive.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar advises ministers to avoid unethical means of acquiring wealth for the kingdom's protection. This advice is not just applicable to ministers but to all individuals in positions of power. The verse emphasizes the importance of integrity and ethical conduct in governance, suggesting that ill-gotten gains can never lead to long-term stability or prosperity.\n\nThiruvalluvar's wisdom in this verse is timeless, reminding us that short-term gains obtained through foul means can lead to long-term destruction. This can be applied to modern contexts as well, where leaders and people in authority must uphold ethical standards and avoid corruption. The verse underlines the importance of transparency, honesty, and fair play in leadership roles, whether in governance, business, or any other field..The kural verse:வினைத்திட்பம் என்பது ஒருவன் மனத்திட்பம்மற்றைய எல்லாம் பிற. ,translates to :A powerful mind does powerful act And all the rest are imperfect,and it's explantion is :Kural 661 emphasizes the importance of mental determination in achieving success in any action or endeavor. According to the verse, the true strength of an action doesn't lie in the physical abilities or the resources at one's disposal, but in the firmness of their mind. It suggests that the resolve or determination within one's mind is the real force behind the successful execution of any task.\n\nThe verse asserts that if an individual lacks mental determination, then despite having all other abilities or resources, their actions might not yield the desired results. This is because it's the mind's firmness that directs and fuels the action towards its goal. Hence, success in any action is largely determined by the strength of one's mental resolve. The verse underscores the power of mental fortitude and its pivotal role in shaping our actions and their outcomes.\n\nIn summary, Kural 661 highlights that firmness in action is primarily a reflection of one's mental resolve. All other abilities, resources, or factors are secondary and cannot ensure success in the absence of a resolute mind..The kural verse:ஊறொரால் உற்றபின் ஒல்காமை இவ்விரண்டின்ஆறென்பர் ஆய்ந்தவர் கோள். ,translates to :Shun failing fuss; fail not purpose These two are maxims of the wise,and it's explantion is :The verse 662 of Thirukkural urges one to exercise discernment and resilience in their actions. The first part of the verse advises not to engage in actions that could lead to ruin, suggesting the importance of foresight and wisdom in making decisions. It is a call to be cautious, to think ahead, plan well and avoid actions that predictably lead to unfavorable consequences.\n\nThe second part of the verse emphasizes on maintaining resilience despite the ruinous outcome of an action. It encourages one to remain undeterred by failures or setbacks. This resilience is what allows one to learn from their mistakes and to continue striving towards their goals, without losing heart in the face of adversity.\n\nSo, the two principles that the verse upholds are foresight and resilience. It is the belief that those who have mastered these two qualities are the ones who have truly understood the nature of actions and their consequences. This wisdom then guides their actions, enabling them to navigate through life effectively, avoiding potential harm and maintaining their spirit even when things do not go as planned. \n\nIn essence, this verse is about wise decision making and resilience in face of adversity - two key life skills for anyone who wishes to lead a successful and fulfilling life..The kural verse:கடைக்கொட்கச் செய்தக்க தாண்மை இடைக்கொட்கின்எற்றா விழுமந் தரும். ,translates to :The strong achieve and then display Woe unto work displayed midway,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 663, emphasizes the importance of discretion and secrecy when undertaking a task. It suggests that true strength or manliness lies not in proclaiming one's intentions and actions beforehand, but in quietly performing one's duties and revealing the results only after the task has been completed. \n\nThe reason for this is that prematurely announcing one's plans may lead to obstacles, complications, and even failure, due to various reasons such as unnecessary scrutiny, sabotage from others, or undue pressure and expectations. This could result in \"irremediable sorrow\" as the verse warns, causing distress and disappointment that could have been avoided. \n\nHence, the verse advocates for discretion, patience, and the element of surprise as key aspects of successful action. This is a practical advice that can be applied to various spheres of life, including personal goals, professional projects, or even strategic decisions in politics and warfare. \n\nIn essence, the Kural promotes the wisdom of the old adage, \"Actions speak louder than words.\" It encourages us to let our achievements speak for themselves, rather than making premature announcements that may not only hamper our progress but also lead to avoidable sorrow..The kural verse:சொல்லுதல் யார்க்கும் எளிய அரியவாம்சொல்லிய வண்ணம் செயல். ,translates to :Easy it is to tell a fact But hard it is to know and act,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the discrepancy between words and actions. It highlights the fact that talking about doing something is easy and can be done by anyone. It requires no real effort or commitment. However, actually implementing what has been said is far more challenging. It requires determination, discipline, and hard work.\n\nThe verse underscores the importance of actions over words. It gently criticizes those who are quick to offer advice or instructions but fail to follow through on their own words. This Kural encourages individuals to walk their talk, to embody their own advice, and demonstrate their commitment through action, not just words. In essence, it promotes integrity and consistency in one's actions and words.\n\nIn a broader cultural context, this verse reflects the timeless wisdom of Tamil philosophy, urging us to strive not just for eloquence in speech, but for excellence and consistency in action. Thiru Kural, through this verse, advocates for authenticity and accountability in our conduct, reminding us that our actions speak louder than words..The kural verse:வீறெய்தி மாண்டார் வினைத்திட்பம் வேந்தன்கண்ஊறெய்தி உள்ளப் படும். ,translates to :Dynamic deeds of a doughty soul Shall win the praise of king and all,and it's explantion is :This verse (Kural 665) emphasizes the power and influence of actions by those who have achieved greatness through their exceptional abilities. It states that the impact of their actions, characterized by steadfastness and determination, does not just stop at them but extends to the rulers or kings as well. Such is the magnitude of their actions that they can influence even those in power.\n\nThe verse also underlines the importance of excellence in one's actions and its resultant influence. Those who have become great through their skills and talents have the ability to shape the decisions and actions of the king or ruler. Their actions, marked by precision and effectiveness, will be recognized and esteemed by all, including the highest authority in the land.\n\nIn essence, the verse lauds the power of excellence and the capacity of talented individuals to influence the course of events, even at the highest levels of governance. It encourages us to strive for greatness in our actions, as it has the potential to create a ripple effect, influencing others in society, including those in power. This is a timeless message that remains relevant across cultures and eras..The kural verse:எண்ணிய எண்ணியாங்கு எய்துவர் எண்ணியார்திண்ணியர் ஆகப் பெறின். ,translates to :The will-to-do achieves the deed When mind that wills is strong indeed,and it's explantion is :Kural 666 emphasizes the importance of firmness and determination in the execution of any planned undertaking. It suggests that if one approaches a task with unwavering resolve and determination, they will be successful in achieving their desired outcome, exactly as they envisioned it.\n\nThis verse underscores the power of steadfastness and perseverance in executing any plan. It implies that planning alone is not sufficient to achieve success. The implementation of the plan with unwavering resolve and determination is equally important. The verse encourages individuals to be resolute in their actions as it is a key factor that leads to success.\n\nIn the broader cultural and moral context, this verse reaffirms the timeless principle that success is the result of hard work, determination, and perseverance. It encourages the reader to not only dream and plan but also to act with steadfast determination to make the dream a reality.\n\nIn summary, Kural 666 states that those who plan and execute their plans with firm determination will achieve their goals exactly as they have envisioned them..The kural verse:உருவுகண்டு எள்ளாமை வேண்டும் உருள்பெருந்தேர்க்குஅச்சாணி அன்னார் உடைத்து. ,translates to :Scorn not the form: for men there are Like linchpin of big rolling car,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 667, advises against belittling or overlooking someone based on their physical size or appearance. The analogy used here is that of a linchpin in a large chariot, which may be small in size but plays a crucial role in the functioning of the chariot. Similarly, the verse suggests that individuals, regardless of their physical stature, can have significant roles and capabilities.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of recognizing and appreciating the value of all individuals, irrespective of their physical size. It reminds us that size or appearance does not dictate the worth or capability of a person. Just as the small linchpin is vital for the smooth operation of a large chariot, small or seemingly insignificant individuals may possess exceptional abilities and can make substantial contributions.\n\nThis verse promotes respect and appreciation for all individuals, regardless of their physical appearances. It encourages us to look beyond superficial attributes and recognize the true qualities and potential within each person. It advocates for a non-judgmental and inclusive approach towards others, emphasizing the importance of their roles and contributions rather than their outward appearance..The kural verse:கலங்காது கண்ட வினைக்கண் துளங்காதுதூக்கங் கடிந்து செயல். ,translates to :Waver not; do wakefully  The deed resolved purposefully,and it's explantion is :Kural 668 emphasizes the significance of firm resolution and swift action in executing any task. Once an action or a decision has been made with a clear and unconfused mind, it's crucial to carry it out with the same level of commitment and without any delay or hesitation. \n\nThis verse suggests that procrastination and lethargy can be the biggest obstacles in the path of accomplishing a task. Therefore, when a task has been decided upon, it must be pursued with steadfastness, speed, and without any slackness. \n\nThe underlying principle here is about the importance of decisiveness, dedication, and promptness in our actions. This is not just a strategy for successful task completion but also a broader philosophy for effective living. \n\nIn a cultural context, this verse reflects the Tamil ethos of diligence, determination, and timely action.

It underlines a sense of optimism and firmness, a quality much appreciated in the Tamil culture.

Even if an individual possesses various talents or abilities, the world will not value or respect them if they lack firmness and steadfastness in their actions. This kural underscores the fact that it is not just talent or ability that matters, but the consistent application of these talents in a determined and unwavering manner. \n\nThis concept aligns with many cultures' emphasis on the virtue of perseverance. It is often not the most talented or smartest who succeed, but those with the most grit and determination to persist in their efforts, regardless of the challenges they face. The kural is a reminder that the world values deeds and actions that are backed by a strong will and unwavering commitment. \n\nIn essence, the verse encourages one to not just possess talents or abilities, but also to apply them consistently and persistently, thereby achieving both personal success and societal respect..The kural verse:சூழ்ச்சி முடிவு துணிவெய்தல் அத்துணிவுதாழ்ச்சியுள் தங்குதல் தீது. ,translates to :When counsel takes a resolve strong Weak delay of action is wrong,and it's explantion is :Kural 671 focuses on the importance of timely execution following thorough deliberation.

Such delay can lead to missed opportunities, decreased effectiveness, and could potentially turn the outcome of the initially beneficial decision into an adverse one. \n\nIn essence, the Kural emphasizes the need for swift action following careful thought, warning against the pitfalls of procrastination. This message is not just relevant to major decisions in governance or leadership, but also applies to our daily lives, encouraging us to act promptly on our well-considered decisions..The kural verse:தூங்குக தூங்கிச் செயற்பால தூங்கற்கதூங்காது செய்யும் வினை. ,translates to :Delay such acts as need delay Delay not acts that need display,and it's explantion is :Kural 672 emphasizes the importance of understanding the urgency of different tasks and acting accordingly. It advises that actions which do not require immediate attention can be done leisurely or \"slept over\", but tasks that demand immediate action should not be delayed or \"slept over\". The term \"sleep over\" here refers metaphorically to delaying or postponing action.\n\nThis Kural, thus, promotes the wisdom of time management and prioritizing tasks based on their importance and urgency. It warns against the danger of procrastination, especially when it comes to critical tasks that require immediate attention. It teaches the principle of discernment in action - understanding what needs to be done now and what can wait.\n\nIn a broader perspective, this Kural is also a lesson in responsibility and diligence. It encourages us to be prompt and efficient in our actions, especially when they are of significant consequence. It is a reminder that delay in such matters can lead to missed opportunities or adverse outcomes. \n\nOverall, the verse emphasizes the importance of discernment, urgency, responsibility, and efficient time management in our actions..The kural verse:ஒல்லும்வா யெல்லாம் வினைநன்றே ஒல்லாக்கால்செல்லும்வாய் நோக்கிச் செயல். ,translates to :It's best to act when feasible If not see what is possible,and it's explantion is :The verse 673 of Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of strategic decision-making, especially in situations of conflict or adversity. It essentially suggests that direct confrontation or fighting is a valid and commendable method when you have the capability and resources to overcome your adversary. However, it also advises that when direct confrontation is not possible or fruitful, one should not insist on it stubbornly but should instead explore and employ other more effective strategies or methods to achieve the desired outcome.\n\nThis verse is deeply relevant in many contexts, from personal conflicts to business strategies and international diplomacy. It advises us to always evaluate our capacities and circumstances before embarking on any course of action, and to be flexible and adaptive in our strategies, rather than rigid and unyielding.\n\nIn essence, this verse is a wise counsel on strategic thinking and effective problem-solving, urging us to choose our battles wisely and to adapt our strategies to the changing realities and dynamics of life. It teaches us that success lies not just in confrontation, but also in understanding, adaptation, and strategic maneuvering.

It suggests that leaving any task or hostility half-done or unresolved is like leaving embers of a fire unextinguished. They might seem harmless for a while, but over time, they can reignite, grow, and cause significant destruction.\n\nThe analogy of the remnant of a fire is used to illustrate the danger of neglecting to fully address a task or an enemy. Just as a fire, even when it seems to be out, can still hold embers that can reignite and cause a devastating fire, an unfinished task or unresolved hostility can grow and lead to unexpected and potentially disastrous consequences.\n\nThis verse encourages us to be thorough and resolute in our actions. When we start a task, we should see it through to its completion. Likewise, if we have a conflict or a disagreement, we should aim to resolve it fully rather than leave it simmering. Unattended issues, like unextinguished embers, can flare up when least expected, leading to detrimental outcomes.\n\nIn essence, the kural advises us to be mindful and diligent in our endeavors, taking care to see things through to the end, thus preventing future troubles that may arise from incompletion..The kural verse:பொருள்கருவி காலம் வினையிடனொடு ஐந்தும்இருள்தீர எண்ணிச் செயல். ,translates to :Money and means, time, place and deed Decide these five and then proceed,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse, Kural 675, emphasizes the importance of thorough planning before undertaking any action. It suggests that five key factors should be meticulously considered to ensure the success of an endeavor. These factors are:\n\n1. Money: Assessing the financial aspect of any endeavor is crucial. Ensure that the necessary funds are available and that the action is economically viable.\n\n2. Means: The tools, resources, and capabilities required to execute the action must be at hand. This includes the skills, manpower, and materials necessary.\n\n3. Time: Timing is critical in any endeavor. The action should be taken when the time is most opportune, taking into account various factors like market conditions, socio-political climate, or personal readiness.\n\n4. Execution: The method or procedure of carrying out the action should be well thought out. This includes understanding the steps involved, potential challenges, and ways to overcome them.\n\n5. Place: The location or environment in which the action takes place can significantly impact its success.

Therefore, this verse is a practical guide that encourages strategic thinking and careful planning in any endeavor..The kural verse:முடிவும் இடையூறும் முற்றியாங்கு எய்தும்படுபயனும் பார்த்துச் செயல். ,translates to :Weigh well the end, hindrance, profit  And then pursue a fitting act,and it's explantion is :Kural 676 emphasizes the importance of foresight and careful planning before embarking on any action. \n\nThe verse advises that we should thoroughly contemplate on three aspects before initiating any task: the effort required to complete it, the potential obstacles that could arise in the process, and the ultimate profit or benefit that could be gained upon its successful completion. \n\nThe first aspect, exertion, refers to the physical and mental effort, time, resources, and energy required to accomplish the task. Knowing this helps us to prepare ourselves adequately and allocate necessary resources.\n\nThe second aspect, obstacles, refers to the potential challenges or hurdles that could hinder the progress or even prevent the completion of the task. Anticipating these obstacles allows us to devise strategies to overcome them or mitigate their impact.\n\nThe third aspect, profit, refers to the benefits or rewards that the completion of the task could bring. This understanding helps us to decide whether the task is worth undertaking, considering the required effort and potential obstacles.\n\nThe verse, thus, emphasizes the importance of strategic planning, foresight, and cost-benefit analysis in our actions. It suggests that such a thoughtful approach can lead to efficient use of resources, effective problem-solving, and ultimately, the successful accomplishment of our goals. \n\nThis wise counsel is relevant across various domains of life, be it personal, professional, social, or political, underscoring the timeless wisdom of Thiru Kural..The kural verse:செய்வினை செய்வான் செயன்முறை அவ்வினைஉள்ளறிவான் உள்ளம் கொளல். ,translates to :Know first the secret from experts That is the way of fruitful acts,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 677, emphasizes the importance of understanding and leveraging the knowledge of those who are more experienced in a specific task before embarking on that task ourselves. It suggests that the most effective way to perform an action is to comprehend the insights and experiences of those who have previously engaged in that action and have deep understanding of its secrets.\n\nIn other words, before undertaking an action, one should seek the advice and counsel of those who have already done it and have been successful. Their experience and understanding of the nuances and subtleties of the task can provide valuable insights that can help avoid pitfalls and ensure success.\n\nThis principle can be applied in many contexts such as in business, where it's common to seek the mentorship or advice of successful entrepreneurs; in academics, where we learn from the research and findings of previous scholars; and in life, where we often seek the wisdom of those older and more experienced. \n\nBy doing so, it ensures that our actions are informed, effective and contribute to our growth and success. This Kural thus emphasizes the timeless wisdom of learning from others' experiences..The kural verse:வினையான் வினையாக்கிக் கோடல் நனைகவுள்யானையால் யானையாத் தற்று. ,translates to :Lure a tusker by a tusker Achieve a deed by deed better,and it's explantion is :This Thirukkural verse (Kural 678) speaks about the wisdom of multitasking and achieving multiple objectives through a single action. \n\nThe metaphor used in the verse is that of capturing one elephant by using another. In ancient times, a common method of capturing wild elephants was by using a trained or tamed elephant. This verse suggests that our actions should be like the trained elephant, capable of accomplishing more than one task.\n\nIn other words, it encourages efficiency and strategic thinking. Instead of focusing on one task at a time, we should aim to accomplish multiple related tasks through a single action, thereby maximizing our productivity and effectiveness. \n\nThis principle can be applied to various aspects of life, including personal tasks, business strategies, and even social initiatives. By making one task a means to accomplish another, we not only save time and resources, but also gain a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. \n\nTherefore, this verse advises us to be strategic and efficient in our actions, ensuring that every effort we make is fruitful in multiple ways..The kural verse:நட்டார்க்கு நல்ல செயலின் விரைந்ததேஒட்டாரை ஒட்டிக் கொளல். ,translates to :Than doing good to friends it is More urgent to befriend the foes,and it's explantion is :Kural 679 provides strategic advice on managing relationships in a scenario of conflict or competition. It suggests that it is more beneficial to quickly align with the enemies of one's enemies than to merely carry out good deeds for one's friends. This is a pragmatic view based on the premise that 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend'. \n\nThe verse counsels that forming alliances with those who oppose our foes can create a powerful counterbalance to those who wish us harm. This approach is more effective and urgent than simply performing good actions for our friends. It implies the importance of strategic alliances, and the need for foresight and proactive action in managing relationships.\n\nIn essence, this verse introduces a principle of strategic alliances often found in political or competitive scenarios. It encourages one to recognize potential allies in unexpected places, and to act swiftly in forming alliances when the opportunity arises.

The verse is saying that the leaders or ministers of smaller states, out of fear that their people might get frightened or intimidated, tend to yield to their larger, more powerful counterparts if they offer a chance of reconciliation or compromise.\n\nThe verse is essentially about the reality of political survival and the balance of power. It highlights the fact that those in positions of lesser power often find themselves compelled to submit to or acknowledge their more powerful adversaries, particularly if it can result in peace or potential benefits for their people. The fear of conflict or aggression from bigger powers often pushes the leaders of smaller states to take conciliatory steps and maintain a harmonious relationship.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, this verse can also be interpreted as an advice on the importance of wisdom and pragmatism in managing relationships and conflicts. It suggests that it is often wiser to choose peace and compromise over conflict, especially when the odds are stacked against us..The kural verse:அன்புடைமை ஆன்ற குடிப்பிறத்தல் வேந்தவாம்பண்புடைமை தூதுரைப்பான் பண்பு. ,translates to :Love, noble birth, good courtesy Pleasing kings mark true embassy,and it's explantion is :The Kural 681 emphasizes on the essential characteristics that an ambassador should possess. These include genuine affection towards his people and nation, a reputable lineage, and attributes that are appealing to the ruling class or royalty. \n\nThe first attribute, affection, ensures that the ambassador genuinely cares for the welfare of his people and nation, enabling him to represent them effectively. \n\nThe second attribute, a commendable lineage, lends credibility and respect to the ambassador, making his words and actions more impactful.\n\nLastly, having pleasing attributes that appeal to the royalty ensures that the ambassador can communicate and negotiate with the rulers effectively, benefiting his people and nation. \n\nIn essence, this verse teaches us that an effective ambassador is not just about diplomatic skills, but also about genuine affection, respectable lineage, and traits that appeal to those in power. It's a timeless wisdom that applies not only to diplomats but also to anyone in a position of representation or leadership..The kural verse:அன்பறிவு ஆராய்ந்த சொல்வன்மை தூதுரைப்பார்க்குஇன்றி யமையாத மூன்று. ,translates to :Envoys must bear love for their prince Knowledge and learned eloquence,and it's explantion is :The Thiru Kural verse 682 emphasizes the essential qualities that an ambassador should possess. The verse highlights three crucial attributes - love for the sovereign, understanding of his affairs, and the ability to articulate effectively before other rulers. \n\nThe first attribute, love for the sovereign, indicates the ambassador's loyalty and dedication to their leader. This love ensures that the ambassador will always act in the best interest of their leader and their homeland. \n\nThe second attribute, knowledge of the sovereign's affairs, underscores the importance of being well-informed. An ambassador should have a deep understanding of their leader's policies, perspectives, and priorities to effectively represent them in foreign lands. \n\nThe third attribute, discriminating power of speech, points to the importance of communication skills. An ambassador should be able to articulate their leader's views clearly, persuasively, and diplomatically, being mindful of the cultural and political sensitivities of the different audiences they interact with.\n\nThese three qualities - love, knowledge, and eloquence - are not just desirable but indispensable for an ambassador, as they form the foundation of effective diplomacy. They enable the ambassador to build strong relationships, negotiate effectively, and promote their leader's interests abroad..The kural verse:நூலாருள் நூல்வல்லன் ஆகுதல் வேலாருள்வென்றி வினையுரைப்பான் பண்பு. ,translates to :Savant among savants, he pleads  Before lanced king, triumphant words,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse 683 emphasizes the need for an ambassador or a diplomat to be well-learned and skilled in the art of communication and politics.

It serves as a reminder that knowledge and effective communication are essential tools for successful diplomacy..The kural verse:அறிவுரு வாராய்ந்த கல்விஇம் மூன்றன்செறிவுடையான் செல்க வினைக்கு. ,translates to :Who has these three: good form, sense, lore Can act as bold ambassador,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural emphasizes the qualities required in an individual who is entrusted with the important task of being a diplomatic envoy or a messenger. It states that there are three key attributes one should possess to effectively fulfill this role.\n\nFirstly, he should have 'natural sense' or innate intelligence. This intelligence should allow him to understand complex situations, perceive nuances, and make effective decisions. He should be able to understand the underlying implications of words and actions which may not be explicitly stated.\n\nSecondly, he should have an 'attractive bearing'. This does not just refer to physical attractiveness, but also to charm, etiquette, and charisma. He should be able to present himself well, communicate effectively, and engage gracefully with others. This quality is important as it can influence how well received his messages are.\n\nLastly, he should have 'well-tried learning'. This implies a deep and broad understanding of various subjects and domains. He should be well-versed in the language, culture, customs, and norms of both his own and the foreign lands he will interact with. This knowledge should be well-tested and proven to be reliable.\n\nThe verse signifies that if an individual embodies these three qualities, he is well-equipped to undertake diplomatic missions. These qualities ensure that he can represent his ruler or country effectively, navigate diplomatic relations tactfully, and promote peace and understanding between nations..The kural verse:தொகச்சொல்லித் தூவாத நீக்கி நகச்சொல்லிநன்றி பயப்பதாந் தூது. ,translates to :Not harsh, the envoy's winsome ways Does good by pleasant words concise,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse emphasizes the qualities of an effective ambassador or envoy. According to Thiruvalluvar, the ideal envoy is someone who communicates succinctly, without causing offense or discomfort. This individual should also be able to make the listener feel at ease, perhaps by using humor or pleasant conversation. \n\nThe purpose of the envoy's communication should be to bring benefits back to his own sovereign or nation. To do this, he must be adept at presenting information in a concise and effective manner, while also filtering out any unnecessary or potentially harmful details. \n\nThe verse suggests that diplomacy is not just about conveying messages; it's also about building understanding, fostering good relations, and securing benefits for one's own side. This requires a delicate balancing of tact, eloquence, and strategic thinking. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can also be applied to our everyday communication. It encourages us to speak in a way that is brief, pleasant, and beneficial, while avoiding harsh or unnecessary words..The kural verse:கற்றுக்கண் அஞ்சான் செலச்சொல்லிக் காலத்தால்தக்கது அறிவதாம் தூது. ,translates to :Learned; fearless, the envoy tends Convincing words which time demands,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural talks about the qualities of an effective ambassador or diplomat. \n\nThe verse suggests that an adept ambassador is one who has a deep knowledge of the subject matter or politics. He is an eloquent speaker who can convey his thoughts and ideas impressively, keeping the audience captivated. His confidence is such that he is not intimidated by the stern or angry looks of his adversaries. \n\nMoreover, an effective diplomat knows how to employ the art of timing. He understands the importance of delivering the right message at the right time. He is aware that the impact of a message can vary greatly depending on when it is delivered, and thus, he waits for the appropriate moment to convey his thoughts.\n\nTo sum up, the verse highlights the importance of knowledge, confidence, eloquence, and a keen sense of timing, as the key attributes of a successful ambassador. It teaches us that diplomacy is not just about negotiating but also about understanding the nuances of human behavior and the art of effective communication..The kural verse:கடனறிந்து காலங் கருதி இடனறிந்துஎண்ணி உரைப்பான் தலை. ,translates to :Knowing duty time and place The envoy employs mature phrase,and it's explantion is :Kural 687 emphasizes the pivotal role of an ambassador and the characteristics that make him exceptional. The verse identifies four critical abilities: understanding his duty (or the message to be conveyed), recognizing the appropriate time for communication, identifying the most suitable place for the conversation, and delivering the message after careful consideration.\n\nThe ambassador's role is crucial because he acts as a bridge between two parties or nations. The verse states that an exceptional ambassador is one who thoroughly understands the message he needs to deliver. He is aware of his responsibilities and the potential implications of his communication.\n\nNext, the verse highlights the importance of timing in diplomatic communication. An excellent ambassador is one who not only knows what to say but also when to say it. He understands that the impact of his message can vary significantly depending on when it is delivered.\n\nThirdly, the verse underscores the importance of choosing the right place for communication. Just like timing, the location can also influence how the message is received. A skilled ambassador can assess the environment and choose a location that would be most conducive to his purpose.\n\nLastly, the verse highlights the value of careful consideration before delivering the message. A superior ambassador does not speak impulsively. Instead, he contemplates on his message, reflecting on its possible interpretations and consequences before he delivers it.\n\nIn conclusion, Kural 687 describes the ideal qualities of an ambassador, emphasizing his role as a discerning, tactful, and strategic communicator..The kural verse:தூய்மை துணைமை துணிவுடைமை இம்மூன்றின்வாய்மை வழியுரைப்பான் பண்பு. ,translates to :The true envoy of three virtues Is pure helpful and bold in views,and it's explantion is :Kural 688 emphasizes the essential qualities of a messenger, particularly one who is responsible for delivering a sovereign's message. \n\nThe first quality is purity, which refers to the individual's moral and ethical integrity. The messenger should be free from corrupt practices, and should not be swayed by temptations or bribes. This ensures that the message is delivered without any alterations or misinterpretations.\n\nThe second quality is the support of foreign ministers. The messenger should be able to establish good relationships with officials from other regions or countries. This diplomatic skill ensures the message is received and understood clearly, fostering good communication and cooperation between different parties.\n\nThe third quality is boldness or courage. The messenger should have the courage to deliver the message accurately, even if it contains sensitive or unpleasant news. This quality ensures that the messenger does not shy away from their responsibility due to fear or intimidation.\n\nIn addition to these three qualities, the verse also emphasizes truthfulness. The messenger should always deliver the message truthfully, without adding or omitting information. This ensures that the message retains its original intent and meaning, and is received as intended by the sovereign.\n\nThus, the verse highlights the qualities of an ideal messenger who is responsible for delivering a sovereign's message - purity, diplomatic support, boldness, and truthfulness. These qualities ensure that the message is communicated effectively and accurately, thereby contributing to good governance and diplomacy..The kural verse:விடுமாற்றம் வேந்தர்க்கு உரைப்பான் வடுமாற்றம்வாய்சேரா வன்கணவன். ,translates to :The envoy who ports the king's message Has flawless words and heart's courage,and it's explantion is :Kural 689 emphasizes the importance of discretion and careful communication, particularly for those entrusted with relaying messages from a king or any sovereign. It suggests that the ideal messenger is one who possesses the discernment not to utter anything, even accidentally, that could potentially discredit or harm the reputation of the one he represents.\n\nThe essence of this couplet is about the ability to maintain confidentiality, to avoid miscommunication, and to uphold the dignity and honour of the one being represented. This is an essential quality for anyone in a position of trust, especially for ambassadors or diplomats who serve as intermediaries between different parties or nations.\n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse also highlights the importance of mindful speech in everyday life. It encourages us to think before we speak, to ensure that our words bring no harm or dishonour to others, and to maintain the trust that others have placed in us. \n\nThis Thirukkural, thus, underlines the need for integrity, discretion, and mindfulness in communication, particularly while representing others..The kural verse:இறுதி பயப்பினும் எஞ்சாது இறைவற்குஉறுதி பயப்பதாம் தூது. ,translates to :Braving death the bold envoy Assures his king's safety and joy,and it's explantion is :The 690th verse of Thiru Kural explains the characteristics of a true ambassador. According to this verse, the ideal messenger or ambassador is one who is fearless in the pursuit of his sovereign's welfare, even if it costs him his life. \n\nThis verse emphasizes the qualities of fearlessness, dedication, and loyalty. The ambassador is expected to fearlessly carry out his duty, undeterred by any potential harm or danger to himself. The primary aim of the ambassador is to secure the good of his king or leader, regardless of the personal cost. \n\nIn a broader context, this verse speaks to the virtue of selflessness and courage in service. It underscores the moral principle that one's duty to one's sovereign, or in a broader sense, to one's community or cause, should surpass concerns for one's own safety or wellbeing. These qualities are not only applicable to ambassadors but are also admirable in any individual, making this verse a timeless reminder of the values of courage, loyalty, and selflessness..The kural verse:அகலாது அணுகாது தீக்காய்வார் போல்கஇகல்வேந்தர்ச் சேர்ந்தொழுகு வார். ,translates to :Move with hostile kings as with fire  Not coming close nor going far,and it's explantion is :Kural 691 narrates the delicate balance that needs to be maintained when one is in the service of a ruler or a person of high authority. The verse uses the metaphor of a person who warms himself near a fire. Just like this person should be close enough to benefit from the heat, but not so close that he gets burnt, one should maintain a neither too distant nor too close relationship with those in power.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of prudence and discretion in dealing with those who wield power. If one is too close, they may risk offending or overstepping boundaries. On the other hand, if one is too distant, they may miss out on opportunities and the possibility of influence. \n\nThus, the verse advises that individuals who dwell under the rule of a powerful king should act with caution and wisdom, maintaining a balanced and respectful distance, just like a person warms himself near a fire without getting too close to get burnt or too far to feel the warmth. The moral implication here is the importance of maintaining the right distance in relationships of power to ensure one's safety and wellbeing..The kural verse:மன்னர் விழைப விழையாமை மன்னரால்மன்னிய ஆக்கந் தரும். ,translates to :Crave not for things which kings desire  This brings thee their fruitful favour,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse emphasizes on the virtue of selflessness and integrity in the role of ministers or advisors to the king. It states that those who do not covet what their king desires will be rewarded with enduring wealth by the king himself.\n\nIn governance, a minister or an advisor should be devoid of personal aspirations that align with the king's desires. This is because their primary role is to serve the king and the kingdom, rather than satisfying their own ambitions. Their responsibility is to provide unbiased advice and guidance to the king, keeping the welfare of the kingdom in mind. \n\nIf the ministers focus on their personal gains, it may lead to corruption and misgovernance, which would eventually cause harm to the king and the kingdom. On the other hand, if they act selflessly and do not covet what the king desires, it builds trust and respect in the eyes of the king. Recognizing their integrity and dedication, the king would reward them with everlasting wealth, which is not just materialistic but also includes respect, trust, and a place of honor in the kingdom.\n\nThis verse thus encourages the virtues of selflessness, integrity, and dedication in individuals who are in positions of power and influence. It reminds us that the path of righteousness and selflessness yields lasting rewards..The kural verse:போற்றின் அரியவை போற்றல் கடுத்தபின்தேற்றுதல் யார்க்கும் அரிது. ,translates to :Guard thyself from petty excess Suspected least, there's no redress,and it's explantion is :Kural 693 emphasizes the importance of a minister's integrity and the avoidance of grave errors in their conduct. It suggests that those who wish to safeguard their position and reputation must refrain from committing serious offenses or mistakes that could arouse the king's suspicion. \n\nIn the context of this verse, the 'king' symbolizes all those in positions of power or authority. The verse suggests that once suspicion is aroused in a person of authority, it is virtually impossible to erase. This underlines the importance of maintaining a consistent display of honesty, integrity, and competence. This principle can also be applied to modern contexts such as workplaces, where maintaining trust and confidence with one's superiors is of utmost importance.\n\nThe verse, therefore, advises that one should always act with caution and wisdom, especially when they are in a position where their actions could be closely scrutinized by those in power. It teaches that suspicion, once aroused, is difficult to dispel, and therefore it is best to avoid situations that could lead to such doubt in the first place. This is a timeless piece of wisdom that promotes honesty, integrity, and conscientiousness in one's professional conduct..The kural verse:செவிச்சொல்லும் சேர்ந்த நகையும் அவித்தொழுகல்ஆன்ற பெரியா ரகத்து. ,translates to :Whisper not; nor smile exchange Amidst august men's assemblage,and it's explantion is :Kural 694 emphasizes the importance of maintaining a respectful demeanor in the presence of a person of great authority or stature, such as a king or a high-ranking official. It advises against engaging in private conversations (whispering to someone's ear) or sharing a light moment (smiling at someone) in such a setting. \n\nThe verse underscores the importance of decorum and respect. Whispering or giggling in the presence of a person of authority can be perceived as disrespectful or inappropriate, as it can give the impression of secrecy or frivolity. \n\nThis Kural, while contextually referring to a royal court setting, holds relevance even today. It speaks to the universal principle of respect towards those in authority, which can be applicable in all walks of life, including professional environments, formal gatherings, and in any situation where there is a clear hierarchy. It encourages a sense of discipline, professionalism, and respect for authority and hierarchy..The kural verse:எப்பொருளும் ஓரார் தொடரார்மற் றப்பொருளைவிட்டக்கால் கேட்க மறை. ,translates to :Hear not, ask not the king's secret Hear only when he lets it out,and it's explantion is :Kural 695 emphasizes the importance of discretion, particularly in the context of a king's council or any leader's advisory board. It advises that ministers or advisors should not eavesdrop or pry into secret counsels of the leader. They should not seek to overhear or investigate what is being discussed. Instead, they should await till the leader reveals the matter themselves.\n\nThis Kural not only showcases a vital trait required for anyone in a position of trust, but also upholds the value of confidentiality in leadership. It underscores that it is inappropriate and disrespectful to invade someone's privacy, especially if that someone is a leader or a ruler. \n\nFurthermore, it also relates to the general ethic of not intruding into anyone's private conversations unless invited to. This Kural, thus, propounds a significant moral conduct for ministers, advisors, and anyone in a position of trust, ensuring respect for privacy, patience, and appropriate conduct..The kural verse:குறிப்பறிந்து காலங் கருதி வெறுப்பிலவேண்டுப வேட்பச் சொலல். ,translates to :Discern his mood and time and tell No dislikes but what king likes well,and it's explantion is :This verse of Thirukkural emphasizes the art of effective communication, particularly in the context of a minister advising a king. It advises that the speaker should be aware of the listener's disposition and choose the right time to present their thoughts. The advice should be desirable and agreeable to the listener, avoiding anything that may cause displeasure.\n\nThe verse is a practical guide for diplomacy and tactful communication. It suggests that understanding the mood and mindset of the person you're communicating with is crucial. The right timing is also important - certain messages may be better received at specific times. The content of the message should be considered carefully too. It should be something that the listener finds agreeable and useful, not something that they would dislike or find disagreeable.\n\nThis verse, while specifically referring to a minister advising a king, can be applied to various scenarios in life. Whether it's a business conversation, a friendly advice, or a critical feedback, understanding the other person's perspective, choosing the right time, and ensuring the message is both agreeable and beneficial can make the communication more effective and productive..The kural verse:வேட்பன சொல்லி வினையில எஞ்ஞான்றும்கேட்பினும் சொல்லா விடல். ,translates to :Tell pleasing things; and never tell Even if pressed what is futile,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse 697 emphasizes the importance of honesty and discretion in an advisory role, particularly for those who serve in the capacity of ministers or counselors to leaders.\n\nThe verse suggests that advisors should always deliver advice that is beneficial and agreeable, regardless of whether the leader has asked for it or not. However, it also strongly advises against recommending actions or strategies that are futile or unproductive, even if they are specifically requested by the leader.\n\nThis verse highlights the essential role of advisors in steering the course of leadership. It underscores their responsibility to ensure the leader's actions are advantageous and meaningful, rather than simply pleasing or agreeable. The verse also reflects the importance of ethical integrity in advisory roles, suggesting that advisors should refuse to endorse or propagate unproductive strategies, even under pressure from the leader.\n\nIn essence, this verse is a reminder that the role of an advisor is not just to echo the leader's preferences, but to provide honest, beneficial advice and to discourage actions that are counterproductive. This is a crucial message not only for political or royal advisors, but for anyone in a position of influence or leadership. It emphasizes the value of ethical, beneficial advice over misleading or harmful counsel..The kural verse:இளையர் இனமுறையர் என்றிகழார் நின்றஒளியோடு ஒழுகப் படும். ,translates to :As young and kinsman do not slight; Look with awe king's light and might,and it's explantion is :Kural 698 emphasizes the importance of ministers respecting their kings, regardless of their age or familial relation. It suggests that ministers should not let these factors cloud their judgment or affect their behavior towards the king.\n\nIn many traditional societies, age and familial ties are often considered significant indicators of respect and authority. However, this kural warns against such prejudices, particularly in a political context. It underscores that a king's authority, symbolized here as a divine light, should be respected and upheld irrespective of his age or relation to the ministers. \n\nThe verse advises ministers not to underestimate or belittle their kings based on age or familial ties, but to treat them with the respect and reverence their position warrants. This is crucial for the smooth functioning and integrity of the administration, as a lack of respect for the king could potentially lead to discord, disloyalty, and inefficiency within the government.\n\nIn essence, the kural emphasizes the necessity of recognizing and respecting the authority of the king, irrespective of his age or familial connections, in order to ensure harmony and efficiency within the kingdom. The focus is on the king's role and contributions rather than his personal attributes or relationships..The kural verse:கொளப்பட்டேம் என்றெண்ணிக் கொள்ளாத செய்யார்துளக்கற்ற காட்சி யவர். ,translates to :The clear-visioned do nothing base Deeming they have the monarch's grace,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural speaks about the wisdom and prudence of those individuals who are endowed with firm judgement and discerning intelligence. These individuals, according to the verse, would never indulge in actions that are disagreeable or displeasing to their sovereign or leader. They understand the implications of their actions and hence, act responsibly. \n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of loyalty and respect towards leadership. It highlights the significance of understanding the expectations and perspectives of the leader before taking any action. In a broader sense, it can also be applied to any situation involving authority, where one has to act in accordance to the preferences of the authority.\n\nThe individuals with firm judgement and discernment are those who comprehend the consequences of their actions. They perceive their role as subjects or followers and hence, they refrain from acting in ways that might displease the leader or disrupt the harmony of the system.\n\nIn essence, this verse underscores the virtue of respect for authority, wisdom in judgement, and the importance of harmonious coexistence in any system, be it a kingdom, an organization, or a society..The kural verse:பழையம் எனக்கருதிப் பண்பல்ல செய்யும்கெழுதகைமை கேடு தரும். ,translates to :Worthless acts based on friendship old  Shall spell ruin and woe untold,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural refers to the detrimental effects of undue familiarity, particularly within the context of a minister-king relationship. It warns against the complacency or arrogance that can arise from long-term familiarity or association with a person of power, such as a king. \n\nThe verse implies that a minister, owing to his prolonged familiarity with the king, may begin to assume undue privileges or liberties, engaging in actions not appropriate to his role or status. Such behavior is not only inappropriate but can also lead to the minister's downfall. \n\nIn essence, the verse underlines the importance of maintaining decorum, respect, and professional boundaries in relationships, even when there is long-standing familiarity. It also cautions against the dangers of overstepping one's role or position, which can lead to ruin and harm. This wisdom holds relevance not only in the context of a royal court but in any relationship or professional setting. \n\nThus, Thirukkural through this verse advises that familiarity should not breed contempt or arrogance, but should rather be governed by respect, appropriateness, and an understanding of one's role and boundaries..The kural verse:கூறாமை நோக்கக் குறிப்பறிவான் எஞ்ஞான்றும்மாறாநீர் வையக் கணி. ,translates to :Who reads the mind by look, untold Adorns the changeless sea-girt world,and it's explantion is :The verse 701 from Thirukural emphasizes the importance of intuitive understanding and non-verbal communication in a successful leadership. The verse speaks of a minister who, by merely looking at the king, understands his thoughts and intentions without them being verbally expressed. \n\nIn leadership, especially in a monarchy, explicit verbal communication may not always be possible or appropriate. Therefore, a minister who can accurately perceive unspoken intentions or sentiments becomes invaluable. This ability not only strengthens the bond between the king and the minister, but also leads to smoother administration and decision-making. \n\nThe verse further states that such a minister will be a perpetual ornament to the world, surrounded by the never-drying sea. This metaphor suggests that just like the sea which never dries up, the value and appeal of such a minister never dwindle. They remain a timeless asset to their kingdom and the world at large, owing to their remarkable ability to understand unsaid thoughts and feelings. \n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse can also be applied to our day-to-day life, emphasizing the importance of empathy, understanding, and non-verbal communication in all our relationships..The kural verse:ஐயப் படாஅது அகத்தது உணர்வானைத்தெய்வத்தோ டொப்பக் கொளல். ,translates to :Take him as God who reads the thought Of another man with without a doubt,and it's explantion is :Kural 702 emphasizes the extraordinary ability of individuals who can understand what's in someone else's mind without any ambiguity. According to Thiruvalluvar, this ability is so unique and rare that those who possess it can be revered as divine or god-like. \n\nIn the context of ancient Tamil culture, where the Thiru Kural was written, understanding others' thoughts was considered a divine gift. This verse underscores the importance of empathy and intuition in human relationships. The ability to perceive and understand what another person is thinking or feeling, without any uncertainty, creates a sense of connection, trust, and respect. \n\nIndeed, this verse could be seen as a tribute to great leaders, wise teachers, and insightful counselors who have the uncanny ability to understand what is in the hearts and minds of those they guide or teach. Their ability to do so makes them appreciated and respected, achieving a status akin to divinity. \n\nIn a broader philosophical context, this verse is also a reminder of the importance of striving for understanding and empathy in our interactions with others. It encourages us to develop our intuitive capabilities and deepen our understanding of others, a quality that is highly valued and respected. \n\nSo, in essence, this Kural verse celebrates the quality of deep understanding and empathy, considering it a divine attribute. It encourages us to strive for this level of understanding in our dealings with others..The kural verse:குறிப்பிற் குறிப்புணர் வாரை உறுப்பினுள்யாது கொடுத்தும் கொளல். ,translates to :By sign who scans the sign admit At any cost in cabinet,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural speaks about the importance of understanding and responding to the non-verbal cues of others, and the value of those who possess this skill. \n\nThe verse advises that a ruler (or any person in a position of power and influence) should recognize and appreciate individuals who have the ability to understand the unspoken thoughts and feelings of others, conveyed through their facial expressions or body language. These individuals are valuable because they can help in predicting or understanding the behavior of others, their motives, and their intentions. \n\nThe verse suggests that those who can 'read' another person's mind through their non-verbal signals are extremely useful, and therefore, should be rewarded and kept close. The ruler is advised to give them whatever they ask for from his belongings as a token of appreciation for their unique skills. \n\nThis can be understood more broadly as the value of empathy and understanding in leadership. Leaders who understand and value the thoughts and feelings of others are more likely to foster a supportive and harmonious environment. They can anticipate problems before they arise and can deal with situations in a way that considers everyone's perspectives. \n\nIn essence, this verse highlights the importance of empathy, understanding, and communication in leadership and relationships..The kural verse:குறித்தது கூறாமைக் கொள்வாரோ டேனைஉறுப்போ ரனையரால் வேறு. ,translates to :Untold, he who divines the thought Though same in form is quite apart,and it's explantion is :The verse 704 of the Thirukkural states: \"Those who understand one's thoughts without being informed and those who do not, may (indeed) resemble one another bodily; still are they different (mentally).\"\n\nIn simple terms, this Kural emphasizes the distinction between individuals based on their understanding and perception, rather than their physical appearance. Even though two people might look similar externally, they could be vastly different in their mental capabilities and perception. Some people have the ability to comprehend another person's thoughts and feelings without any explicit communication, while others may not have this understanding.\n\nThe verse suggests that the ability to empathize and understand another's thoughts without them having to say it out loud is a mark of wisdom and intelligence. It is this ability to perceive and comprehend that sets people apart mentally, even if they might seem similar in physical form. \n\nThis notion aligns with the broader philosophy of the Thirukkural that values wisdom, understanding, and empathy over superficialities like physical appearance. The verse encourages us to cultivate our mental faculties of understanding and empathy, as these are what truly differentiate us from others..The kural verse:குறிப்பிற் குறிப்புணரா வாயின் உறுப்பினுள்என்ன பயத்தவோ கண்? ,translates to :Among senses what for is eye If thought by thought one can't descry?,and it's explantion is :The verse, Kural 705, beautifully encapsulates the importance of empathy and understanding in human interactions. The verse is essentially asking: If one's eyes cannot perceive, understand, and empathize with the emotions and thoughts reflected in another person's expressions, then what use are those eyes? \n\nThe eyes are not just organs of physical vision, but they are also instruments of emotional and psychological understanding. They are the windows through which we can discern the unspoken feelings and thoughts of others. These feelings are often communicated through subtle facial expressions, gestures, and body language. \n\nThus, this verse emphasizes the ability to 'read' another person's state of mind or emotions, which is a crucial aspect of effective communication and empathy. If our eyes fail to perform this function, their value diminishes, regardless of their ability to see the physical world. \n\nThis verse from Thiru Kural underscores the value of emotional intelligence and understanding in human relationships, thereby encouraging us to develop these essential skills for better interpersonal relationships..The kural verse:அடுத்தது காட்டும் பளிங்குபோல் நெஞ்சம்கடுத்தது காட்டும் முகம். ,translates to :What throbs in mind the face reflects Just as mirror nearby objects,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural portrays the deep connection between a person's mental state and their physical expression. It uses the analogy of a mirror to explain this connection. Just as a mirror reflects the object that is placed before it without any distortion or discrepancy, the human face too reflects the emotions and thoughts that are prevailing in the mind.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the fact that one's feelings and thoughts cannot be concealed for long, no matter how hard one tries to hide them. The face acts as a mirror to the mind and gives away the innermost feelings and thoughts. This is a fundamental truth about human nature and human expressions which is universally applicable irrespective of cultural, geographical, or temporal differences.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, this verse encourages honesty, transparency, and authenticity. It reminds us that pretense and deception can never be sustained for long as the truth has a way of revealing itself through our expressions. Hence, it urges us to be true to ourselves and to others.\n\nMoreover, this verse also highlights the importance of emotional intelligence and empathy in human interactions. By observing the facial expressions of others, one can understand their mental state and respond accordingly, fostering better communication and stronger relationships. This also underlines the importance of being aware of our own expressions, as they can impact how others perceive us and interact with us..The kural verse:முகத்தின் முதுக்குறைந்தது உண்டோ உவப்பினும்காயினும் தான்முந் துறும். ,translates to :Than face what is subtler to tell First if the mind feels well or ill,and it's explantion is :Kural 707 is a reflection on the transparency and expressiveness of a human face. It suggests that there's nothing as revealing or knowledgeable as a person's face, as it tends to precede the mind in showcasing our emotions, whether they're feelings of pleasure or irritation.\n\nThe verse puts emphasis on the face as a mirror to the mind, a window to our innermost feelings, thoughts, and character. Even before the mind fully processes an emotion, the face is already exhibiting it. This means the face serves as a barometer, effectively displaying our reactions to various situations, events, or sentiments.\n\nThus, the Kural underscores the importance of learning to interpret the nuances of facial expressions, as they offer valuable insights into a person's emotional state and thought process, even before they voice it out. It also subtly hints at the importance of being honest and transparent in our emotions, as our faces tend to reveal the truth, whether we verbally express it or not..The kural verse:முகம்நோக்கி நிற்க அமையும் அகம்நோக்கிஉற்ற துணர்வார்ப் பெறின். ,translates to :Just standing in front would suffice For those who read the mind on face,and it's explantion is :Kural 708 emphasizes the importance of understanding and empathy, particularly in the context of a ruler's relationship with his advisors or councillors. \n\nIn this verse, Saint Thiruvalluvar suggests that a good king should surround himself with individuals who are capable of understanding his thoughts, intentions, and emotions without him having to express them verbally. This capacity to 'read' the king's mind is a result of deep understanding, empathy, and familiarity. \n\nThe verse essentially asserts that if a king has such advisors who can discern his thoughts by merely looking at him, then it would suffice for the king to simply stand and look at their faces. In other words, the king does not have to articulate his thoughts, worries or plans; these wise advisors will understand his intentions and be able to provide counsel or take actions accordingly. \n\nThis kural underscores the importance of mutual understanding and unspoken communication in effective leadership. It also highlights the value of empathy and insightful perception in governance and decision making..The kural verse:பகைமையும் கேண்மையும் கண்ணுரைக்கும் கண்ணின்வகைமை உணர்வார்ப் பெறின். ,translates to :Friend or foe the eyes will show To those who changing outlooks know,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse emphasizes the importance of discernment and understanding non-verbal cues in the world of diplomacy and leadership. The verse suggests that if a leader or king has advisors who are proficient in observing and interpreting the subtle movements of the eye, they can discern the true intentions of their counterparts, whether they harbor friendship or enmity, even in the absence of explicit declarations.\n\nThe \"movements of the eye\" here is a metaphor referring to non-verbal cues or body language, which often reveals what words might not. The ability to read these signs is an essential skill for ministers advising a leader, as it can provide valuable insights into the intentions and attitudes of others, helping to navigate political landscapes and foster or avert alliances and conflicts.\n\nMoreover, this verse also highlights the wisdom in appointing ministers who possess such discerning capacities, as their insights can significantly contribute to the leader's decision-making process and overall governance..The kural verse:நுண்ணியம் என்பார் அளக்குங்கோல் காணுங்கால்கண்ணல்லது இல்லை பிற. ,translates to :The scale of keen discerning minds  Is eye and eye that secrets finds,and it's explantion is :Kural 710 discusses the limitations of those who claim themselves to be intelligent and discerning. According to this verse, the only tool these individuals have at their disposal to \"measure\" or understand others' thoughts and perspectives is their own eyes, symbolizing their personal perspective and limited understanding.\n\nThe verse points out that those who judge the world solely based on their own viewpoint will fail to truly comprehend the depth and diversity of others' thoughts and feelings. Their understanding is confined to what they perceive through their own eyes or personal experiences. \n\nIn a broader context, this Kural teaches us the importance of empathy and open-mindedness in understanding others. It emphasises that true wisdom lies in acknowledging the limitations of our own perspectives and striving to understand the world from various viewpoints.\n\nIn terms of cultural context, this verse is a critique of the ministers or advisors who claim to be wise but base their judgments solely on their own perspectives. This could lead to flawed decisions, as they are not considering the full spectrum of opinions or feelings of others. Therefore, it serves as a reminder for leaders to listen and consider the viewpoints of others before making decisions..The kural verse:அவையறிநது ஆராய்ந்து சொல்லுக சொல்லின்தொகையறிந்த தூய்மை யவர். ,translates to :The pure in thought and eloquence  Adapt their words to audience,and it's explantion is :The Kural 711 emphasizes the importance of eloquence, understanding, and deliberate speech, especially in a court or formal setting. This Kural advises that only those who have mastered language and understand the nature of their audience should speak in such situations.\n\nThe verse suggests that one should not only be aware of the language and its nuances but also the composition of the gathering or court they are addressing. Understanding the characteristics, knowledge level, and expectations of the audience is crucial to communicate effectively and meaningfully. \n\nIn essence, this Kural teaches the importance of thoughtful and deliberate speech, which requires both a deep understanding of language and an awareness of the audience. It encourages us to choose our words carefully, considering the context, the listeners, and the implications of our words. \n\nIt is a wisdom that remains relevant even today, where effective communication is key in all walks of life, be it in personal relationships, professional settings or public forums..The kural verse:இடைதெரிந்து நன்குணர்ந்து சொல்லுக சொல்லின்நடைதெரிந்த நன்மை யவர். ,translates to :Who know the art of speech shall suit Their chosen words to time in fact,and it's explantion is :Kural 712 emphasizes the importance of effective communication, particularly in a court or formal setting. It suggests that those with a good understanding of language and its nuances should speak only after carefully considering the timing and the situation. \n\nThe verse recognizes the power of words and encourages the speaker to discern their appropriate usage. It advises that the spoken words should not only be accurate, but also be relevant to the situation and delivered at the right time. \n\nThe Tamil explanations further highlight the need to understand the nature of words, the context in which they are used, and the need to deliver them in a manner that is pleasing to the listeners. \n\nOverall, the kural advocates for mindful and thoughtful communication, underlining the importance of timing, context, and the speaker's knowledge of language..The kural verse:அவையறியார் சொல்லல்மேற் கொள்பவர் சொல்லின்வகையறியார் வல்லதூஉம் இல். ,translates to :They speak in vain at length who talk Words unversed which ears don't take,and it's explantion is :Kural 713 emphasizes the necessity of understanding the context and nature of a situation before speaking. In this Kural, the \"court\" mentioned is a metaphor for any gathering or situation. It advises that speaking without knowing the context or nature of the audience is analogous to ignorance. Such individuals are not only unaware of how to use their words effectively, but they also lack the ability to learn and improve their communication skills.\n\nThis Kural underscores the importance of thoughtful communication. It encourages one to be aware of the dynamics of the situation, understand the audience, and use words appropriately. This leads to effective communication, which in turn fosters respect and understanding. Speaking impulsively without understanding the context, on the other hand, can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts.\n\nIn essence, this Kural encourages mindfulness in communication. It suggests that understanding the context, choosing the right words, and delivering them appropriately is a skill that needs to be cultivated for effective communication..The kural verse:ஒளியார்முன் ஒள்ளிய ராதல் வெளியார்முன்வான்சுதை வண்ணம் கொளல். ,translates to :Before the bright be brilliant light Before the muff be mortar white,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural is about the tact of a wise minister or advisor. It advises that in the assembly of enlightened or learned people, ministers should shine bright with their wisdom and knowledge, just like a light illuminating a room. They should use their intellect, experience, and understanding to contribute valuable insights, echoing the intelligence of the group.\n\nOn the other hand, when in the company of those who are less knowledgeable or unenlightened, the ministers should exercise caution and humility. They should not flaunt their knowledge, but rather present themselves as if they are ignorant, much like the pure whiteness of a mortar that doesn't reflect any color. This is not about deceiving others, but about understanding the audience and behaving in a manner that doesn't intimidate or alienate them. \n\nEssentially, the verse emphasizes the importance of adaptability and flexibility in communication, which are crucial qualities for someone in a position of influence or power. It teaches that wisdom is not just about accumulating knowledge, but also about knowing when and how to use it appropriately..The kural verse:நன்றென்ற வற்றுள்ளும் நன்றே முதுவருள்முந்து கிளவாச் செறிவு. ,translates to :Modest restraint all good excels Which argues not before elders,and it's explantion is :Kural 715 emphasizes the virtue of modesty and restraint, particularly in the presence of those who are superior in wisdom. It asserts that the best quality one can exhibit is to refrain from speaking or asserting oneself prematurely in an assembly of learned individuals. This restraint is not about suppressing one's voice or ideas, but about demonstrating respect for the wisdom and knowledge of others, acknowledging their superiority, and understanding the right time and place to express one's thoughts.\n\nIn essence, this Kural advocates for the cultivation of humility, respect for others' wisdom, and the discernment to know when to speak and when to listen. It suggests that this discernment, or modesty, is the most commendable of all virtues. This is a timeless principle that resonates even in today's society where active listening and respect for others' perspectives are highly valued.\n\nThe Tamil explanations provided reinforce this interpretation, highlighting the value of refraining from premature speech in the presence of those more learned or experienced. They emphasize the virtue of modesty and restraint as superior to all other forms of goodness or virtue..The kural verse:ஆற்றின் நிலைதளர்ந் தற்றே வியன்புலம்ஏற்றுணர்வார் முன்னர் இழுக்கு. ,translates to :Tongue-slip before the talented wise is like slipping from righteous ways,and it's explantion is :The Kural 716 highlights the significant role of a minister or an advisor and the importance of their precision in speech, especially when addressing those with a wealth of knowledge and understanding. It implies that a minister should be careful with his words, as a small mistake in his speech could lead to a significant loss of respect, akin to a virtuous man falling off the path of righteousness.\n\nThe verse metaphorically compares a minister's blunder in his speech to a good man stumbling from the path of virtue. This analogy underlines the gravity of such a mistake, emphasizing that it's not a minor error but a significant fall, which could potentially diminish his credibility and influence. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can be seen as a reminder for anyone in a position of influence or authority that their words carry weight and can have significant consequences. It encourages mindfulness, thoughtfulness, and precision in speech. It also emphasizes the importance of being aware of the audience's knowledge level and adjusting the communication accordingly to avoid misunderstandings or misinterpretations..The kural verse:கற்றறிந்தார் கல்வி விளங்கும் கசடறச்சொல்தெரிதல் வல்லார் அகத்து. ,translates to :The learning of the learned shines Valued by flawless scholar-minds,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of deep comprehension and the ability to articulate learned knowledge flawlessly. The verse says that those who have gained extensive knowledge and have understood it profoundly will display their erudition in assemblies where the words are examined faultlessly. \n\nIn such gatherings, where every word is scrutinized for its accuracy, the knowledge of people who have not only learned but also thoroughly understood their subjects will stand out. Their ability to present their ideas in a clear, concise, and error-free manner will shine brightly, demonstrating the depth of their learning and their mastery over their subjects.\n\nIn simpler terms, it is not just about learning or gathering information, but it's about understanding what has been learned and being able to explain it flawlessly. This verse celebrates not just the act of learning, but the comprehension and flawless articulation of knowledge..The kural verse:உணர்வ துடையார்முன் சொல்லல் வளர்வதன்பாத்தியுள் நீர்சொரிந் தற்று. ,translates to :To address understanding ones Is to water beds of growing grains,and it's explantion is :The Kural 718 is a profound verse that underscores the value of teaching or instructing those who are already capable of understanding and learning on their own. \n\nIn this verse, Valluvar uses the beautiful metaphor of watering a bed of plants that are already growing on their own. Just as the plants receive nourishment from the water and flourish even more, the individuals who are already capable of understanding and learning will also benefit from the instruction or guidance provided to them. They will be able to absorb the information, understand it in their own unique way, and use it to further their knowledge and wisdom.\n\nThis kural emphasizes the importance of providing guidance and knowledge to those who possess the ability to comprehend and learn. It recognizes that while these individuals may already be capable of learning on their own, they can still greatly benefit from the wisdom and insights of others. \n\nThis verse is not only a commentary on the process of learning but also a subtle nod to the role of a teacher or a guru, who waters the minds of learners with wisdom, helping them grow and flourish. However, it's important to note that the growth is ultimately dependent on the learner's own ability to understand and assimilate knowledge. \n\nIn essence, Kural 718 encourages the act of sharing knowledge and wisdom with those who are eager to learn and capable of understanding, likening it to watering a fertile and growing field..The kural verse:புல்லவையுள் பொச்சாந்தும் சொல்லற்க நல்லவையுள்நன்குசலச் சொல்லு வார். ,translates to :O ye who speak before the keen Forgetful, address not the mean,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse emphasizes the importance of discerning the right audience for one's words. It instructs those who are capable of articulating profound thoughts and ideas to be cautious about where and to whom they share these insights. The verse suggests that such wisdom should not be shared in an assembly of people who lack the understanding to appreciate it, even if done so unintentionally.\n\nThe idea conveyed here is akin to the English idiom \"Casting pearls before swine\" which means to offer something valuable or good to someone who does not know its value. This verse encourages individuals to save their wisdom and intellectual discourse for those who can appreciate and benefit from it, rather than wasting it on those who can't grasp its significance.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse also underlines the value of discretion and the importance of understanding the receptivity of one's audience. It suggests that wisdom not only lies in what you say, but also in understanding where, when, and to whom it's appropriate to say it.\n.The kural verse:அங்கணத்துள் உக்க அமிழ்தற்றால் தங்கணத்தார்அல்லார்முன் கோட்டி கொளல். ,translates to :To hostiles who wise words utters Pours ambrosia into gutters,and it's explantion is :Kural 720 emphasizes on the importance of sharing knowledge or wisdom with the right audience. The verse metaphorically compares sharing valuable thoughts or words of wisdom with an uninformed or unappreciative crowd to pouring nectar onto the ground. Just as the nectar loses its value when it falls on the ground and is wasted, the pearls of wisdom lose their value when shared with those who cannot recognize or appreciate their worth.\n\nThis verse is a reminder to us to choose our audience wisely. It encourages us to share our knowledge with those who can understand, appreciate, and utilize it effectively. This ensures that our words and ideas create the desired impact and are not wasted. It also underlines a certain respect for the knowledge we possess, suggesting that it should not be squandered but rather given to those who can truly value it. \n\nThis teaching can be applied in various life situations, whether it's an academic setting where one shares knowledge with students, a professional environment where one shares insights with colleagues, or a social gathering where one shares experiences and wisdom with friends and family. The key message is to ensure that our valuable words find a suitable and appreciative audience..The kural verse:வகையறிந்து வல்லவை வாய்சோரார் சொல்லின்தொகையறிந்த தூய்மை யவர். ,translates to :The pure fail not in power of words Knowing grand council's moods and modes,and it's explantion is :Kural 721 emphasizes the power of knowledge and the purity of speech. This verse highlights the virtues of those who are well-versed in their language, understand the nature of their audience, and are not intimidated by the presence of powerful individuals. \n\nThese individuals are referred to as 'pure', signifying their integrity, wisdom and clarity in their thought processes. They have a deep understanding of words and their classifications. In the context of the Tamil language, this points to knowing the right usage of vocabulary and grammar, and their nuances. \n\nThe verse also highlights the importance of understanding the audience or the context (the nature of the court) before speaking. This suggests the need for being aware of socio-cultural norms, the nature of the people one is addressing, and the situation at hand.\n\nLastly, it emphasizes the courage of these learned individuals who do not falter in their speech, even in front of a powerful assembly. This implies that their deep knowledge and understanding give them the confidence to speak without fear or hesitation, maintaining their integrity and honesty. \n\nOverall, this verse is a tribute to the power of knowledge, eloquence, understanding, and courage, which together make a person's speech effective, respectful, and fearless..The kural verse:கற்றாருள் கற்றார் எனப்படுவர் கற்றார்முன்கற்ற செலச்சொல்லு வார். ,translates to :Among scholars he is scholar Who holds scholars with learned lore,and it's explantion is :The Kural 722 emphasizes the importance of effective communication of one's knowledge. The verse states that those individuals who can articulate their acquired knowledge in a manner that resonates with other learned individuals are regarded as the most erudite among the educated. \n\nThe underlying message here is twofold. First, acquiring knowledge is important, but equally important is the ability to communicate that knowledge effectively. Knowledge that cannot be shared or communicated becomes less valuable. \n\nSecond, the verse suggests that the true test of one's knowledge is not merely in its acquisition but in its acceptance by other learned people. If one's ideas and knowledge can be understood, accepted, and appreciated by other scholars, it is a confirmation of the depth and validity of one's learning.\n\nIn essence, this verse encourages the readers not only to pursue knowledge but also to cultivate the skill to communicate that knowledge effectively to others, especially to those who are equally or more learned. It posits that the true scholars are those who can engage other scholars in intellectual discourse, presenting their ideas and knowledge in an agreeable and comprehensible manner..The kural verse:பகையகத்துச் சாவார் எளியர் அரியர்அவையகத்து அஞ்சா தவர். ,translates to :Many brave foes and die in fields The fearless few face wise councils,and it's explantion is :Kural 723 is a profound reflection on courage in various aspects of life. The verse emphasizes the differences in exhibiting bravery in physical combat and intellectual discourse.\n\nThe first line, \"Many indeed may (fearlessly) die in the presence of their foes,\" refers to the physical courage that many individuals may possess. It is easier for a great number of people to exhibit bravery in a battlefield, potentially risking their lives in the face of their enemies. This kind of courage, while commendable, is relatively common.\n\nThe second line, however, \"few are those who are fearless in the assembly of the learned,\" speaks of intellectual courage, which is rarer. It talks about the fearlessness required to express one's thoughts, ideas, and knowledge in the presence of learned and wise individuals, often referred to as an assembly or a council in ancient times. This kind of courage is harder to find, as it requires not just bravery but also wisdom, knowledge, and the ability to articulate oneself effectively.\n\nTherefore, this Kural emphasizes that while physical courage is relatively common, intellectual courage is rare and truly commendable. It encourages the reader to strive for the latter, suggesting that true bravery lies not just in physical strength, but also in intellectual prowess and the ability to fearlessly express one's thoughts and ideas..The kural verse:கற்றார்முன் கற்ற செலச்சொல்லித் தாம்கற்றமிக்காருள் மிக்க கொளல். ,translates to :Impress the learned with your lore From greater savants learn still more,and it's explantion is :Kural 724 emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and humility in the face of knowledge. It advises that one should always present their knowledge before the learned or experts in a respectful and agreeable manner. This fosters an environment of mutual respect and learning.\n\nThe verse further suggests that no matter how much one has learned, there is always more to learn from those who are more knowledgeable or experienced. Therefore, it encourages the pursuit of more knowledge from these superiors. This demonstrates a deep respect for knowledge and the understanding that learning is a never-ending process.\n\nThe Kural is particularly applicable to ministers or advisors in a royal court, but it can be extended to modern contexts as well. In any profession or field of study, it is important to maintain humility, share our knowledge in a respectful manner, and always seek to learn more from those who know more than us. This ensures continuous growth and development in our respective fields..The kural verse:ஆற்றின் அளவறிந்து கற்க அவையஞ்சாமாற்றங் கொடுத்தற் பொருட்டு. ,translates to :Grammar and logic learn so that Foes you can boldly retort,and it's explantion is :The Kural 725 emphasizes the importance of profound knowledge and understanding for anyone who wishes to speak fearlessly and convincingly in any gathering, particularly in a foreign court or a council of learned people. \n\nThe verse advises that one should learn and master the art of logical reasoning and argumentation, based on established grammatical rules and principles. This knowledge will empower them to respond without fear, even when scrutinized or challenged, and effectively convey their thoughts or defend their standpoints.\n\nThis Kural underscores the universal principle that in-depth knowledge and understanding provide confidence and assertiveness. It's particularly relevant to statesmen, diplomats, or ministers who are often required to engage in discussions or negotiations in foreign courts. However, it can be broadly applied to any individual who needs to express their ideas or arguments convincingly and fearlessly in any situation.\n\nIn a broader perspective, the verse also advocates for continuous learning and intellectual growth to articulate ideas fearlessly and effectively. This is a timeless wisdom that remains relevant in today's world, where knowledge and effective communication are key to success in various fields..The kural verse:வாளொடென் வன்கண்ணர் அல்லார்க்கு நூலொடென்நுண்ணவை அஞ்சு பவர்க்கு. ,translates to :To cowards what can sword avail And books to those who councils fail?,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse, number 726, is a profound statement on the purpose and utility of courage and knowledge. In the first line, Valluvar questions the use of a sword for those who lack valor. The implication here is that the weapon, despite its lethal potential, is useless in the hands of the cowardly. The sword serves as a metaphor for courage and bravery - without these qualities, the sword loses its power and purpose.\n\nIn the second line, the poet makes a parallel observation about knowledge and wisdom. He argues that just as a sword is futile in the hands of the cowardly, so is knowledge when held by those who are afraid of an intelligent assembly or a scholarly discourse. This line underscores the idea that the true value of knowledge lies not merely in its acquisition but in its application, particularly in intellectual discussions and debates. \n\nIn essence, the verse emphasizes that courage without action and knowledge without application are both fruitless. The moral lesson is that one should not just acquire skills or knowledge but also have the courage and confidence to use them effectively..The kural verse:பகையகத்துப் பேடிகை ஒள்வாள் அவையகத்துஅஞ்சு மவன்கற்ற நூல். ,translates to :Like eunuch's sword in field, is vain His lore who fears men of brain,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural, a classic Tamil text, emphasizes the importance of confidence and courage in public speaking or discourse. It draws a metaphor between a scholar who lacks the courage to express his knowledge in front of an audience and a hermaphrodite wielding a shining sword in front of their enemies. \n\nThe hermaphrodite, despite possessing a sharp and shining sword, is likely to be fearful in the face of foes due to their inherent disposition and hence, the sword becomes useless in their hands. Similarly, a scholar, regardless of the depth and breadth of his knowledge, if he lacks the courage to express it in an assembly or public discourse, his knowledge becomes futile. \n\nThe learning referred to in this verse is not just academic knowledge, but also wisdom and insights gained through experience. Such learning, if not shared or put to use, loses its value. \n\nThis verse is a critique of those who amass knowledge but lack the courage or skill to articulate it. It underscores the idea that knowledge is valuable only when it is shared and put to good use. Furthermore, it also highlights the importance of public speaking skills and confidence in effectively utilizing one's knowledge..The kural verse:பல்லவை கற்றும் பயமிலரே நல்லவையுள்நன்கு செலச்சொல்லா தார். ,translates to :Though learned much his lore is dead Who says no good before the good,and it's explantion is :The Kural 728 emphasizes the importance of eloquence and the ability to express one's thoughts clearly and effectively. Regardless of how much knowledge one has gathered or how many skills one has acquired, if they lack the ability to convey their thoughts in a comprehensible and agreeable manner, particularly in an intellectual assembly, their knowledge is deemed ineffective and unprofitable.\n\nThis verse underscores the significance of good communication skills, particularly in a community of learned individuals where the exchange of thoughts and ideas is of great importance. It further suggests that a person's worth is not only determined by the quantity of their knowledge but also by their capacity to share and utilize this knowledge effectively. \n\nTherefore, the verse encourages the development of articulate communication skills along with the acquisition of knowledge. It criticizes those who hoard knowledge but fail to share it effectively, suggesting that such knowledge is of little use. \n\nIn a broader context, the verse also emphasizes the social aspect of learning, suggesting that knowledge gains true value when shared and discussed in a community. It reminds us that effective communication is as important as knowledge acquisition..The kural verse:கல்லா தவரின் கடையென்ப கற்றறிந்தும்நல்லா ரவையஞ்சு வார். ,translates to :Who fear to face good assembly Are learned idiots, certainly,and it's explantion is :Kural 729 is a verse that emphasizes the importance of courage in the face of knowledge. The verse states that those who have acquired knowledge but are fearful to share or debate it in the assembly of the wise are deemed to be lesser than those who are uneducated.\n\nThe verse suggests that knowledge is not merely about its acquisition but also about its application and the confidence with which it is communicated. The assembly of the wise or the good here refers to a gathering of knowledgeable and morally upright individuals. This could be a forum for intellectual discourse or debate.\n\nThe fear referred to here is not just about the physical fear of speaking in public, but also about the fear of scrutiny, of being wrong, or of being criticized. The verse implies that those who have knowledge but lack the courage to assert it are not making full use of their learning. Such individuals, despite their education, are considered inferior to those who are uneducated. This is because the uneducated have the potential to learn and grow, while those with knowledge who do not utilize it are stagnating.\n\nIn essence, this verse underscores the idea that knowledge gains its true value when it is shared and discussed openly, and that requires courage. Hence, courage and fearlessness in the face of intellectual discourse are as important as the acquisition of knowledge itself..The kural verse:உளரெனினும் இல்லாரொடு ஒப்பர் களன்அஞ்சிக்கற்ற செலச்சொல்லா தார். ,translates to :They are breathing dead who dare not Empress before the wise their art,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 730, emphasizes the importance of effective communication and the courage to express one's knowledge. It suggests that a person who is scared or hesitant to share their knowledge or wisdom in a public assembly, due to fear or nervousness, is equivalent to a person who is dead, even though they are alive. \n\nThe verse highlights that knowledge isn't just about acquiring information, but also about having the ability to convey it effectively to others. If one is unable to do so because of fear or shyness, then their knowledge becomes useless, and they are rendered ineffective, as if they were dead. \n\nThis verse underscores the value of communication skills and public speaking in sharing and spreading knowledge. It encourages individuals not to let fear hinder them from expressing their learned wisdom or insights. Thiruvalluvar, the author, thus, indirectly urges scholars to overcome their fears and to be vocal about their ideas and thoughts. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse also signifies that a life lived in fear is comparable to death, and it encourages individuals to overcome their fears and speak their minds..The kural verse:தள்ளா விளையுளும் தக்காரும் தாழ்விலாச்செல்வரும் சேர்வது நாடு. ,translates to :It's country which has souls of worth Unfailing yields and ample wealth,and it's explantion is :Kural 731 speaks about the ideal components of a prosperous and harmonious nation or kingdom. According to the Kural, a truly flourishing nation is one that combines three essential elements: fruitful agriculture, virtuous people, and wealthy individuals who do not misuse their wealth.\n\nThe first component is agriculture, which is cited as a vital industry for any nation. A kingdom with abundant and consistent produce indicates a healthy economy, as it not only feeds the population but also contributes to trade and commerce.\n\nThe second component is virtuous people. This refers to individuals who are morally upright, wise, and just. Such people contribute to the social fabric of the nation, upholding law and justice, promoting peace and harmony, and driving the ethical and moral growth of the society.\n\nThe third component is wealth that is not misused or squandered. This suggests the presence of individuals who have considerable wealth, but who use it judiciously and responsibly. They do not indulge in conspicuous consumption or unethical practices, but rather, contribute to the economic stability and growth of the nation.\n\nIn essence, this Thiru Kural verse is emphasizing that a prosperous and harmonious nation is built on a foundation of thriving agriculture, virtuous citizenry, and responsible wealth..The kural verse:பெரும்பொருளால் பெட்டக்க தாகி அருங்கேட்டால்ஆற்ற விளைவது நாடு. ,translates to :The Land has large luring treasure Where pests are nil and yields are sure,and it's explantion is :Kural 732 speaks about the ideal qualities of a successful and prosperous nation. According to this Kural, a kingdom or a nation is considered prosperous and successful when it possesses extensive wealth. Such wealth not only constitutes material riches but also includes resources like knowledge, culture, and natural resources.\n\nThe verse also mentions that a prosperous nation is one that is desired by others. This could mean that other nations admire or envy it because of its wealth and prosperity, indicating its high standing amongst its peers.\n\nFurthermore, the Kural emphasizes that an ideal nation should be free from any destructive causes. This could refer to a variety of factors such as social unrest, corruption, natural calamities, or invasion by external forces. A nation that is free from these destructive forces is more likely to flourish and prosper.\n\nFinally, the verse asserts that a prosperous nation is one which grows greatly in prosperity. This indicates that a successful nation doesn't stagnate but constantly strives for growth and improvement, continually enhancing its wealth and well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, Kural 732 provides a well-rounded definition of a prosperous nation - one that is rich in resources, admired by others, free from destructive causes, and constantly growing in prosperity..The kural verse:பொறையொருங்கு மேல்வருங்கால் தாங்கி இறைவற்குஇறையொருங்கு நேர்வது நாடு. ,translates to :It's land that bears pressing burdens And pays its tax which king demands,and it's explantion is :Kural 733 emphasizes the strength and resilience that are required for a kingdom or nation to thrive. It asserts that a true kingdom is one that can not only bear the weight of any additional burdens imposed upon it, such as invasions, natural disasters, or influx of refugees from neighboring nations, but also fulfill its responsibilities towards its sovereign or ruler by paying the full tribute or taxes without fail.\n\nThis kural underlines the need for a kingdom to be self-sufficient and robust, capable of withstanding challenges and fulfilling its obligations. It suggests that a kingdom's strength and prosperity are measured not only by its wealth and resources but also by its ability to manage unexpected difficulties and maintain its commitments to its ruler.\n\nThe verse can also be interpreted metaphorically to apply to individual lives, suggesting that a successful person is one who can handle any challenges that come their way while maintaining their duties and responsibilities. This kural, thus, highlights the virtues of resilience, commitment, and responsibility as key elements for success, whether for a kingdom or an individual..The kural verse:உறுபசியும் ஓவாப் பிணியும் செறுபகையும்சேரா தியல்வது நாடு. ,translates to :It is country which is free from Fierce famine, plague and foemen's harm,and it's explantion is :Thiru Kural verse 734 emphasizes the ideal state of a kingdom and the factors that contribute to its prosperity. According to the verse, a kingdom is considered prosperous and well-managed if it is free from three major afflictions - excessive starvation, incurable diseases, and destructive enemies.\n\nThe first affliction, excessive starvation, highlights the importance of providing for the basic needs of the kingdom's citizens. It underlines the role of the rulers in ensuring food security and minimizing hunger. If the kingdom fails to provide for its people, it can lead to social unrest and instability.\n\nThe second affliction, incurable diseases, refers to the health of the citizens. A prosperous kingdom should have robust health care facilities capable of preventing and treating diseases. Inability to control epidemics may lead to loss of lives and a decrease in the productivity of the kingdom.\n\nThe third affliction, destructive enemies, points to the kingdom's external threats. A prosperous kingdom should be able to defend its territories and people from external aggression. It should have a strong military and diplomatic strategies to deter enemies.\n\nIn essence, the verse defines a prosperous kingdom as one that ensures the well-being of its citizens, maintains a healthy population, and effectively safeguards its sovereignty against external threats. It provides a timeless wisdom on good governance that remains relevant even today..The kural verse:பல்குழுவும் பாழ்செய்யும் உட்பகையும் வேந்தலைக்கும்கொல்குறும்பும் இல்லது நாடு. ,translates to :Sects and ruinous foes are nil No traitors in a land tranquil,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse speaks about the characteristics of a well-governed and harmonious kingdom. According to Valluvar, a good kingdom is one that is devoid of divisive groups, internal enemies who bring about destruction from within, and violent savages who pose a threat to the sovereign.\n\nThe first part of the verse mentions \"various (irregular) associations\". This could imply groups that have formed based on caste, religion, political beliefs, or other divisive factors. Such groups can lead to internal discord, disrupt harmony, and weaken the unity of the kingdom.\n\nThe second characteristic of a good kingdom is the absence of \"destructive internal enemies\". These are people or factions within the kingdom itself who, due to their malicious intent or personal agenda, cause harm to the stability and peace of the kingdom.\n\nThe third characteristic emphasizes the absence of \"murderous savages who harass the sovereign\". These could refer to violent elements or rebels who not only disturb the peace but also pose a direct threat to the ruler and the established order.\n\nIn essence, the verse underlines the importance of unity, internal peace, and the absence of violent threats for a kingdom to thrive and prosper. It suggests that a well-governed kingdom is one where the people live in harmony, free from internal strife and external threats, under the rule of a sovereign who ensures such conditions..The kural verse:கேடறியாக் கெட்ட இடத்தும் வளங்குன்றாநாடென்ப நாட்டின் தலை. ,translates to :The land of lands no ruin knows Even in grief its wealth yet grows,and it's explantion is :Kural 736 speaks about the resilience and strength of a kingdom. It emphasizes the characteristics that make a kingdom truly great.\n\nThe verse says that the best kingdom is one that remains unaffected by the evil or harm from its enemies. This means that the kingdom is so strong in its defense and so prepared in its strategies that it remains unscathed by any potential threats or attacks. It's a kingdom that has the capability to neutralize or overcome adversities with intelligence and strength.\n\nMoreover, even if the kingdom experiences any damage or injury, it does not let that affect its productivity or fruitfulness. It swiftly recovers from the setback, maintaining its prosperity and growth. This resilience also signifies the kingdom's robust systems, effective leadership, and the indomitable spirit of its people.\n\nTherefore, a great kingdom, as per this Kural, is defined not just by its invincibility towards external threats but also by its resilience and capacity to sustain and enhance its prosperity, irrespective of the circumstances. This Kural can also be metaphorically applied to individuals, implying that a person's greatness lies in their ability to remain unaffected by negativity and to bounce back stronger from adversities..The kural verse:இருபுனலும் வாய்ந்த மலையும் வருபுனலும்வல்லரணும் நாட்டிற்கு உறுப்பு. ,translates to :Waters up and down, hills and streams With strong forts as limbs country beams,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 737, delves into the strategic considerations that go into establishing and maintaining a kingdom. It underlines the importance of natural resources and geographical features in ensuring the prosperity and security of a nation.\n\nThe verse identifies four key elements that constitute a well-established kingdom. Firstly, it mentions the \"two waters\", which refers to the availability of water resources from both above (rainwater) and below (groundwater or water from rivers and seas). Water is the lifeblood of any civilization, vital for agriculture, drinking, and various other societal needs.\n\nThe second element is \"well-situated hills\". Hills and mountains provide natural barriers against invasions, serve as sources of valuable minerals and other resources, and also influence the climate and water distribution of the region. \n\nNext, the verse mentions an \"undestructible fort\". This symbolizes a strong defense system that can resist any external threats. A fort, in ancient times, was not just a military structure but also the administrative and economic center of the kingdom. It represented the power and stability of the ruling authority.\n\nLastly, the verse indicates the importance of consistent rainfall (\"varupunal\"). Rain is crucial for agriculture, which was the primary occupation in ancient societies. Regular rainfall ensures a good harvest, leading to food security and economic prosperity.\n\nIn summary, this verse emphasizes the strategic considerations in the establishment of a kingdom - the availability of water resources, the presence of natural defenses and resources offered by hills, a robust fort symbolizing strong defense and administrative capability, and a favorable climate for agriculture. These factors are just as relevant today as they were in ancient times, underlining the timeless wisdom of Thirukkural..The kural verse:பிணியின்மை செல்வம் விளைவின்பம் ஏமம்அணியென்ப நாட்டிவ் வைந்து. ,translates to :Rich yield, delight, defence and wealth Are jewels of lands with blooming health,and it's explantion is :The Kural 738 emphasizes the five key aspects that constitute the prosperity and beauty of a kingdom. These include, first and foremost, the health of its people, which means the kingdom should be free from epidemics or any widespread diseases. Secondly, it should possess wealth and resources, implying a robust economy that ensures the well-being of its citizens. \n\nThe third aspect is a bountiful produce, which refers to the kingdom's agricultural yield or any form of staple production that serves as the primary source of sustenance for the people. This implies the necessity of fertile lands and favorable climatic conditions. \n\nThe fourth attribute is happiness, which underlines the importance of the contentment of the citizenry. A kingdom is truly prosperous only when its people live in a state of happiness and satisfaction, free from suffering and distress. \n\nFinally, the kingdom should provide protection to its subjects. This means a secure environment where law and order prevail, and the citizens are safe from internal and external threats. \n\nThese five elements, according to learned scholars, are the 'ornaments' or distinguishing features of a flourishing kingdom. They not only add to the kingdom's external charm but also ensure a robust and harmonious societal structure within..The kural verse:நாடென்ப நாடா வளத்தன நாடல்லநாட வளந்தரு நாடு. ,translates to :A land is land which yields unsought Needing hard work the land is nought,and it's explantion is :The Kural 739 speaks about the true wealth and prosperity of a kingdom. According to this verse, the best kind of kingdom is one where wealth is abundant naturally, without the need for strenuous labor or exhaustive efforts. This could mean a kingdom rich in natural resources, fertile lands, and prosperous trades that do not require overworking of its people.\n\nContrarily, a kingdom that solely depends on labor-intensive efforts for wealth is not considered as prosperous. This could be due to the hardships and toil its people must undergo, which might lead to dissatisfaction, unrest, and lower living standards, despite any apparent wealth.\n\nIn essence, the verse emphasizes that a kingdom's true wealth is not just measured by its material prosperity, but by the ease and quality of life it offers to its citizens. An ideal kingdom is one where its wealth is sustainable and is obtained without causing undue hardship to its people..The kural verse:ஆங்கமை வெய்தியக் கண்ணும் பயமின்றேவேந்தமை வில்லாத நாடு. ,translates to :Though a land has thus every thing It is worthless without a king,and it's explantion is :Kural 740 speaks about the importance of harmony between the ruler and the ruled in a country. Even if a country is endowed with all kinds of natural resources and wealth, they are meaningless if there is a lack of good governance and rapport between the sovereign and the subjects.\n\nThe Kural emphasizes that the wealth of a nation is not just its material resources, but also the harmony, unity, and mutual respect between its ruler and its people. It suggests that without good governance and a ruler who genuinely cares for his or her subjects, all the wealth and resources are of no use. They cannot bring prosperity or happiness to the people.\n\nIn essence, this Kural highlights the critical role of leadership in a nation's development and prosperity. It underscores that an effective and empathetic leader is one who maintains a harmonious relationship with his subjects, understanding their needs, and working towards their welfare. Without such a leader, even a resource-rich nation can fail to prosper. \n\nSo, the Kural implies that good governance and a harmonious relationship between the ruler and the people are more valuable than any material resources or wealth..The kural verse:ஆற்று பவர்க்கும் அரண்பொருள் அஞ்சித்தற்போற்று பவர்க்கும் பொருள். ,translates to :The fort is vital for offence Who fear the foes has its defence,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse discusses the importance of a fort or stronghold in both offensive and defensive strategies. It highlights the dual role a fort plays in times of conflict.\n\nOn one side, for an army preparing to march against their foes, a fort serves as a crucial base. It works as a launchpad for their attacks, providing them with the necessary resources, protection, and strategic advantages. This is why the fort is deemed significant for those on the offensive.\n\nOn the other side, for those who are threatened by their enemies and wish to safeguard themselves, a fort serves as a refuge. It provides them with safety and the means to withstand attacks, thereby ensuring their survival. This is why the fort is deemed equally important for those in a defensive position.\n\nTherefore, this verse emphasizes that a fort, due to its strategic and protective roles, holds great importance in warfare, regardless of whether one is the aggressor or defender. It underlines the crucial role of strongholds in military tactics and their importance for survival and success during times of conflict..The kural verse:மணிநீரும் மண்ணும் மலையும் அணிநிழற்காடும் உடைய தரண். ,translates to :A crystal fount, a space a mount Thick woods form a fort paramount,and it's explantion is :In Kural 742, Thiruvalluvar emphasizes the importance of natural resources and geographical features in determining the strength and resilience of a fort. \n\nHe lists four key elements: clear water, fertile plains, high mountains, and dense forests. \n\nClear water is vital for sustaining life. It is needed for drinking, farming, and other daily activities. Therefore, a fort situated near a source of clear water is beneficial for its inhabitants.\n\nFertile plains symbolize agricultural productivity. A fort surrounded by such lands can support its population with enough food and other resources, thus ensuring their survival in times of siege or scarcity.\n\nMountains serve as natural barracks, providing a strategic advantage. They act as a natural barrier against enemies, making a fort situated on or near a mountain harder to conquer.\n\nDense forests offer cool shade and are a source of wood, fruits, and other resources. They can also serve as a natural camouflage, hiding the fort from enemy view.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar suggests that a true fort is not just about walls and gates; it is about leveraging nature's bounty to ensure the fort's endurance and the well-being of its inhabitants. This verse is a testament to his deep understanding of geography, strategy, and sustainability..The kural verse:உயர்வகலம் திண்மை அருமைஇந் நான்கின்அமைவரண் என்றுரைக்கும் நூல். ,translates to :An ideal fort's so says science: High, broad, strong and hard for access,and it's explantion is :This verse of Thiru Kural indicates the four essential characteristics that make a fortress or a stronghold impenetrable and formidable. The first is height, which provides a vantage point for surveillance and defense, and also makes it difficult for enemies to ascend. The second is breadth, which ensures that the fort has enough space for soldiers, supplies, and other necessary resources. The third is strength, which refers to the robustness of the fort's construction, making it resistant to attacks and sieges. The fourth is inaccessibility, signifying that the fort should be placed in a location that is difficult to reach or attack, such as a hilltop or island. \n\nThese principles can also be metaphorically applied to personal fortitude, where height represents ambition or high ideals, breadth signifies broad knowledge or experience, strength denotes resilience or determination, and inaccessibility refers to maintaining one's integrity and principles that cannot be easily compromised. \n\nThe verse is a testament to the wisdom of ancient strategists and their understanding of defensive architecture, as well as a lesson in personal fortitude and resilience..The kural verse:சிறுகாப்பிற் பேரிடத்த தாகி உறுபகைஊக்கம் அழிப்ப தரண். ,translates to :Ample in space, easy to hold The fort foils enemies bold,and it's explantion is :Kural 744 talks about the defining characteristics of a well-devised fort. According to Thiruvalluvar, the author of Thiru Kural, an ideal fort should have ample interior space but should only possess small, manageable areas that need to be defended. \n\nThe idea behind having large interior space is to accommodate a considerable population, storage for food and other resources, and to facilitate easy movement of troops within. The limited areas to be defended make it easier for the defending army to secure the fort against enemy attacks.\n\nThe second part of the kural suggests that the fort should also be designed in such a way that it can shatter the morale of any besieging enemy. This could be achieved by making the fort impregnable or by setting up intimidating defenses that can discourage enemies from launching an attack.\n\nIn essence, this kural provides a strategic blueprint for designing a strong and effective fort, which is a crucial asset in times of war. The principles outlined in this kural remain relevant to modern military strategy, demonstrating Thiruvalluvar's timeless wisdom..The kural verse:கொளற்கரிதாய்க் கொண்டகூழ்த் தாகி அகத்தார்நிலைக்கெளிதாம் நீரது அரண். ,translates to :Impregnable with stores of food Cosy to live-That fort is good,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural, Kural 745, outlines the key characteristics of a strong and impregnable fortress. The verse asserts that a true fortress is one that is invincible and impenetrable, even amidst continuous attacks. It should be self-sustaining, with ample provisions to meet the needs of its inhabitants, ensuring their survival during long sieges. Furthermore, it should offer an advantageous position for its inhabitants to defend themselves easily against hostile forces. This Kural holds a broader implication beyond the military context, suggesting that strength, self-sufficiency, and strategic advantage are crucial aspects of any robust defense or survival strategy, be it in personal life, business, or politics..The kural verse:எல்லாப் பொருளும் உடைத்தாய் இடத்துதவும்நல்லாள் உடையது அரண். ,translates to :A fort is full of stores and arms And brave heroes to meet alarms,and it's explantion is :This Thirukkural essentially emphasizes the characteristics of a strong fort. It says that a robust fort should be equipped with all necessary resources and also have capable and courageous warriors who can safeguard it from enemies' destruction. \n\nIn a broader sense, this Kural also implies the importance of preparedness and resourcefulness in any situation, not just in the context of a physical fort. It implies that to be truly strong and unassailable, one must have all the required resources at disposal and the right people with the necessary skills to use them effectively. This could be applied in various scenarios such as a business, a project, or even personal life.\n\nThe focus on 'excellent heroes' also underscores the importance of having competent and brave people who can take on challenges and protect against any harm. It suggests that strength comes not just from physical resources but also from the people who wield those resources.\n\nIn summary, this Kural teaches us that true strength lies in the availability of necessary resources and the presence of skilled and brave individuals who can use those resources effectively to prevent any potential destruction. It's a call for preparedness, resourcefulness, and valor..The kural verse:முற்றியும் முற்றா தெறிந்தும் அறைப்படுத்தும்பற்றற் கரியது அரண். ,translates to :Besieging foes a fort withstands Darts and mines of treacherous hands,and it's explantion is :Kural 747 sheds light on the characteristics of a well-constructed fortress or fort. It portrays a fort as an impregnable establishment that is impenetrable and impervious to any form of attack. \n\nThe Kural asserts that a true fort is one that remains unconquerable, irrespective of the approach of the enemy. Whether the enemy attempts to besiege it, launch a direct assault, or even try to undermine it from within, a well-fortified stronghold should be able to withstand these adversities. \n\nThe essence of this Kural can be applied to individual character as well. Just as a fort protects a kingdom from external threats, a person's moral and ethical character acts as a fort protecting them from negative influences. In this context, the verse emphasizes the importance of building one's character to be strong and resilient, akin to an impenetrable fort. \n\nThus, the Kural teaches us about the significance of strength, resilience, and preparedness, whether it be in warfare, building fortresses, or character formation. These traits make one invincible in the face of adversity and challenges..The kural verse:முற்றாற்றி முற்றி யவரையும் பற்றாற்றிப்பற்றியார் வெல்வது அரண். ,translates to :A fort holds itself and defies The attacks of encircling foes,and it's explantion is :The verse, Kural 748, speaks about the concept of fortitude and resilience. The term \"fort\" in this verse is used metaphorically to represent a person's strength or capacity to withstand adversities.\n\nThis Kural explains that a true fort is one where its inhabitants can defend themselves and their position, even when facing opponents who are stronger or more powerful. This means they can resist the siege, maintain their ground, and eventually overcome the intruders. This ability to resist, defend, and triumph is the hallmark of a true fort.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse applies not only to literal warfare but also to life's struggles. It suggests that one's inner strength, resilience, and determination are crucial for overcoming challenges or difficulties. Regardless of how formidable the obstacles or adversaries may be, standing firm and fighting back without yielding ground represents true strength and victory.\n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes the importance of resilience and the ability to confront and overcome challenges, suggesting that these are the true signs of strength and success..The kural verse:முனைமுகத்து மாற்றலர் சாய வினைமுகத்துவீறெய்தி மாண்ட தரண். ,translates to :A fort it is that fells the foes And gains by deeds a name glorious,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse talks about the fundamental attributes of a fort, emphasizing strategic warfare. The verse suggests that a fort's true strength and excellence are not determined merely by its physical structure and defenses, but by the strategies and tactics executed by its inhabitants to defeat their enemies in the battlefield.\n\nThe fort here can also be seen as a metaphor for a person or an organization. The true strength of a person or an organization lies in the ability to strategize and tactically respond to adversities or challenges, not just in their physical or visible resources.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, the poet, is emphasizing the importance of intelligence, strategy, and proactive action in overcoming obstacles and adversities. This reflects not only in warfare but also in the everyday challenges of life. It teaches us that to be truly strong and successful, we need to be strategic and proactive, rather than relying solely on our visible resources or strengths..The kural verse:எனைமாட்சித் தாகியக் கண்ணும் வினைமாட்சிஇல்லார்கண் இல்லது அரண். ,translates to :But a fort however grand Is nil if heroes do not stand,and it's explantion is :Kural 750 emphasizes the importance of competent and efficient individuals in maintaining the strength and functionality of a fort. Despite a fort being equipped with all the necessary infrastructure, advanced features, and strategic advantages, it is deemed to be virtually ineffective if the people managing it lack the necessary skills and expertise.\n\nThis verse metaphorically applies to various scenarios in life. Be it a corporation, a government, a family, or any other institution, the infrastructure and resources alone do not guarantee success or prosperity. It is the effective and efficient actions of the people who manage these entities that drive their success. \n\nIn this context, the term 'excellence of action' refers to the skill, efficiency, and wisdom required to manage and utilize resources effectively. If the people in charge lack these qualities, even a fort with superior features becomes worthless.\n\nTherefore, this Kural implies that human resource, their skills, and their actions are more critical than the physical infrastructure or material resources in achieving success and prosperity..The kural verse:பொருளல் லவரைப் பொருளாகச் செய்யும்பொருளல்லது இல்லை பொருள். ,translates to :Naught exists that can, save wealth Make the worthless as men of worth,and it's explantion is :Kural 751 explores the transformative power of wealth. It states that aside from wealth, there is no other element that can elevate individuals of lesser significance to a position of importance. This verse reflects on the societal value attributed to wealth, suggesting that it can transform the perception of individuals, regardless of their inherent qualities or lack thereof.\n\nThe verse points to the influence and leverage that wealth can provide, enabling individuals to gain respect, status, and significance within their communities. It underscores the societal reality where wealth often dictates the level of importance and respect an individual receives. At the same time, it subtly hints at the superficiality of such a system, where merit or personal qualities might be overlooked in favor of material wealth.\n\nBy stating that there is nothing else but wealth that can bring about such a change, the verse is not necessarily endorsing this viewpoint but rather commenting on the potent role wealth plays in societal perception and status. It prompts readers to reflect on the value system of society and the importance it places on wealth, often at the expense of other virtues. \n\nOverall, this kural provokes thought on the societal implications of wealth and its influence on an individual's status and importance. It encourages us to consider whether we should allow wealth to be the sole determinant of a person's worth and significance..The kural verse:இல்லாரை எல்லாரும் எள்ளுவர் செல்வரைஎல்லாரும் செய்வர் சிறப்பு. ,translates to :The have-nothing poor all despise The men of wealth all raise and praise,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural reflects upon the societal attitudes towards wealth and poverty. It states that those who are poor are often looked down upon and disregarded by all, irrespective of their other virtues or qualities. On the other hand, the wealthy are admired and esteemed by everyone, regardless of their character or moral standing.\n\nThe verse is a commentary on the materialistic tendencies of society, where wealth often overshadows virtues. It highlights the unfortunate reality that material wealth often determines a person's worth in society, rather than their character or actions. It encourages us to reflect upon these attitudes and prioritise moral and ethical qualities over material wealth..The kural verse:பொருளென்னும் பொய்யா விளக்கம் இருளறுக்கும்எண்ணிய தேயத்துச் சென்று. ,translates to :Waneless wealth is light that goes To every land and gloom removes,and it's explantion is :Kural 753 speaks about the profound influence of wealth, comparing it to an \"imperishable light\". The simile is used to convey the idea that wealth, like light, has the power to eliminate darkness. In this context, the 'darkness' can be interpreted as hardships, troubles, or enmity. \n\nThe verse suggests that wealth, when appropriately used, can reach any destination as per the owner's wish and dispel the darkness present there. It means that wealth can solve problems, overcome obstacles, and even pacify enemies. This verse emphasizes the effectiveness and the beneficial aspect of wealth when it is put to good use.\n\nHowever, it is essential to understand that the verse is not promoting materialism or the blind pursuit of wealth. Instead, it encourages the wise and purposeful use of wealth as a tool to bring about positive changes and to remove difficulties in life. It's a reminder of the responsibility that comes with wealth and the potential it carries for good deeds..The kural verse:அறன்ஈனும் இன்பமும் ஈனும் திறனறிந்துதீதின்றி வந்த பொருள். ,translates to :The blameless wealth from fairest means Brings good virtue and also bliss,and it's explantion is :Kural 754 revolves around the concept of morally and ethically acquired wealth. It underlines the importance of obtaining wealth through righteous means, devoid of any malpractices or foul deeds.\n\nAccording to the verse, wealth, when acquired with a clear understanding of the right methods and without resorting to unfair ways, brings along with it virtue (righteousness) and happiness. This underscores that the means of wealth accumulation play a significant role in determining its true value and impact on the individual's life.\n\nThe wealth that is amassed without any harm or violation of ethical norms will not only provide material comfort but will also pave the way for moral uprightness, leading to a contented and fulfilled life. It brings pleasure not just in the materialistic sense but also in the ethical perspective by upholding one's dignity and integrity.\n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes the significance of honesty and righteousness in wealth accumulation and the lasting joy and virtue it bestows. It encourages one to stay away from deceitful ways of acquiring wealth, thereby promoting a life of morality, peace, and happiness..The kural verse:அருளொடும் அன்பொடும் வாராப் பொருளாக்கம்புல்லார் புரள விடல். ,translates to :Riches devoid of love and grace Off with it; it is disgrace!,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural has a profound message regarding the accumulation of wealth and the ethics that should govern it, particularly for those in positions of power such as kings. \n\nThe verse emphasizes that wealth and riches should not be pursued or amassed at the expense of mercy and love. It suggests that it is better to refrain from accumulating wealth if it does not come with compassion and love. This can be interpreted in two ways: firstly, the process of acquiring wealth should not be devoid of kindness and love towards others. It should not involve exploitation, cruelty or harm. Secondly, the wealth that is acquired should be used with compassion and love. It should be distributed fairly and used for the welfare of the people.\n\nIn essence, this verse advises against greed and ruthless pursuit of wealth, advocating instead for ethical conduct and benevolence. It conveys the moral message that wealth, when detached from humanity and kindness, loses its value and becomes a source of harm rather than good. \n\nThe verse is particularly directed at kings, who have the power and influence to amass wealth. In this context, the verse serves as a reminder that they have a moral responsibility to ensure their wealth is acquired and used in a way that benefits their subjects and promotes love and compassion. This principle, however, can be applied to any individual or entity in a position of power or wealth..The kural verse:உறுபொருளும் உல்கு பொருளும்தன் ஒன்னார்த்தெறுபொருளும் வேந்தன் பொருள். ,translates to :Escheats, derelicts; spoils of war Taxes duties are king's treasure,and it's explantion is :Kural 756 delves into the concept of royal wealth or revenues in the context of a king's rule. The verse suggests that a king's wealth comes from three primary sources: taxes, tributes, and the spoils gained from defeating enemies.\n\nThe first part of the verse, \"உறுபொருளும் உல்கு பொருளும்,\" refers to the wealth that comes naturally without any heir or acquired from foreign countries. This could be interpreted as the income generated through taxes or revenue from the kingdom's natural resources.\n\nThe second part, \"தன் ஒன்னார்த் தெறுபொருளும்,\" refers to the wealth obtained as a result of victory over enemies. This could be the spoils of war or tributes paid by conquered territories.\n\nFinally, the verse concludes with \"வேந்தன் பொருள்\" which implies that all these sources of wealth belong to the king.\n\nEssentially, this verse emphasizes the legitimate ways in which a king can acquire wealth. It highlights the importance of a king's military prowess, wise governance, and just rule, as these are the means through which he can generate income for his kingdom. It also subtly underscores the responsibilities of a king - to protect his kingdom, ensure its prosperity, and maintain peace and order..The kural verse:அருளென்னும் அன்பீன் குழவி பொருளென்னும்செல்வச் செவிலியால் உண்டு. ,translates to :Grace the child of love is nourished By the wet-nurse of wealth cherished,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse (Kural 757) is a metaphorical exploration of the relationship between love, compassion, wealth, and prosperity. In the verse, love is metaphorically referred to as the mother, and compassion (or mercy) as the child born of love. Wealth is likened to a nurse or caregiver, responsible for nurturing and ensuring the growth of the child.\n\nThe verse implies that compassion, which emerges from love, thrives and grows under the care and nurturing of wealth. This is not to say that wealth itself is the source of compassion, but rather it provides the means through which acts of compassion can be materialized and expanded.\n\nThe moral interpretation of this verse is that while love and compassion are innate human virtues, wealth plays a crucial role in enabling and amplifying our capacity for compassion. It allows us to turn our compassionate feelings into tangible acts of charity and benevolence. Therefore, wealth, when used wisely, can be a powerful tool to foster and spread love and compassion in society..The kural verse:குன்றேறி யானைப்போர் கண்டற்றால் தன்கைத்தொன்றுஉண்டாகச் செய்வான் வினை. ,translates to :Treasures in hand fulfil all things Like hill-tuskers the wars of kings,and it's explantion is :The Thiru Kural verse 758 emphasizes the security and confidence that comes with financial stability when embarking upon a venture or undertaking. The analogy used here is of a person observing a dangerous elephant fight from the safety of a hill-top. This is likened to a person who embarks on a venture while having substantial financial resources at hand. \n\nJust as the observer on the hill-top can watch the elephant fight without any personal risk or danger, a person with financial resources can take on ventures with ease and confidence, as they have the means to tackle any unforeseen difficulties or obstacles that might arise during the course of their undertaking. They are not directly exposed to the risks, and thus can make better and more strategic decisions. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse encapsulates the age-old wisdom that advises us to ensure a solid foundation before taking on any significant tasks or challenges. This could be in the form of financial resources, knowledge, skills, or any other forms of capital that could provide a safety net in times of adversity..The kural verse:செய்க பொருளைச் செறுநர் செருக்கறுக்கும்எஃகதனிற் கூரிய தில். ,translates to :Make wealth; there is no sharper steel The insolence of foes to quell,and it's explantion is :The kural 759 emphasizes the importance of accumulating wealth. It suggests that wealth is a powerful tool that can quell the arrogance of one's enemies. \n\nIn the context of this verse, 'wealth' doesn't merely refer to material possessions or money but can also be interpreted as resources, knowledge, or skills. The accumulation of these can provide a person with significant power and influence, which can help them stand tall and strong against their adversaries.\n\nThe verse tells us that there is no weapon sharper than wealth, as it has the potential to break the arrogance of foes. This doesn't advocate using wealth as a means of oppression, but as a tool to command respect and deter any hostility.\n\nIn other words, this verse encourages individuals to strive for abundance in their life as it can serve as a protective shield against their enemies, discouraging them from causing harm. It underlines the significance of wealth as a means of establishing one's position and defeating the pride of adversaries.\n\nHowever, this verse should be interpreted with a balanced perspective. While wealth can be a powerful tool, it should not lead to greed or unethical behavior. The ultimate goal should be to use wealth wisely for the welfare of oneself and society at large..The kural verse:ஒண்பொருள் காழ்ப்ப இயற்றியார்க்கு எண்பொருள்ஏனை இரண்டும் ஒருங்கு. ,translates to :They have joy and virtue at hand Who acquire treasures abundant,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural emphasizes the importance of acquiring wealth through honest means. It suggests that the individuals who have managed to amass considerable wealth in a righteous manner can easily attain the other two essential aspects of life - virtue (aram) and pleasure (inbam). \n\nThe verse implies that wealth, when earned rightfully, becomes a facilitator for leading a virtuous and pleasurable life. Virtue here could mean leading a life of righteousness, compassion, charity, and truthfulness. Pleasure, on the other hand, could refer to satisfaction, joy, and the overall contentment in life. \n\nSo, in essence, the verse underscores the fact that honest and abundant wealth makes it easier for one to live a life of virtue and pleasure, thereby fulfilling the three essential elements of a wholesome life - wealth, virtue and pleasure. This reflects the ancient Tamil ethos which highly values righteousness in acquiring wealth and considers it an enabler of leading a virtuous and satisfying life..The kural verse:உறுப்பமைந்து ஊறஞ்சா வெல்படை வேந்தன்வெறுக்கையுள் எல்லாம் தலை. ,translates to :The daring well-armed winning force Is king's treasure and main resource,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse, Kural 761, emphasizes the importance and value of a well-equipped and fearless army to a ruler. In essence, it asserts that an army that is well-structured, complete in all its components, and unafraid to engage in battle, is the greatest asset or wealth a ruler can possess. \n\nThe verse discusses the army in terms of its completeness, indicating that every aspect of it, be it infantry, navy, air force, or security forces, should be finely tuned and ready for battle. The army should also be fearless, willing to face the enemy without hesitation or fear of wounds or loss. \n\nSuch an army, according to the verse, is more valuable than any other material wealth or resource a ruler can have. It is the army's ability to protect, conquer, and maintain stability that makes it an invaluable asset. The strength of a kingdom or a nation is ultimately measured by the strength and courage of its army. \n\nThis verse, in a broader sense, also suggests that courage and readiness to face challenges head-on are significant attributes, whether it's for an individual or a nation. It encourages preparedness, fearlessness, and comprehensive planning as qualities to be cultivated and valued. \n\nIn summary, this verse extols a well-prepared and brave army as the most valuable possession, reflecting the broader themes of courage, preparedness, and comprehensive planning..The kural verse:உலைவிடத்து ஊறஞ்சா வன்கண் தொலைவிடத்துத்தொல்படைக் கல்லால் அரிது. ,translates to :Through shots and wounds brave heroes hold Quailing not in fall, the field,and it's explantion is :This verse talks about the unwavering loyalty and courage of an ancient army towards its king, even in the face of defeat or adversity. The verse states that only an ancient army has the valour to stand by its king during times of defeat, undeterred by fear of wounds or its diminished strength. \n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of courage, loyalty, and the willingness to endure hardships for a cause or a person one believes in. It implies that this kind of steadfast courage and commitment is hard to find and is unique to the ancient armies.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can be applied to modern concepts of loyalty, dedication, and courage. It teaches us that, despite the difficulties and challenges we may face, we should remain loyal and committed to our cause. It also implies that true courage is not about never falling, but about standing up again each time we fall, undeterred by the fear of defeat or hardship.\n\nIn the cultural context, the verse reflects the importance given to loyalty, courage, and endurance in ancient Tamil society, particularly in the context of war and military service. The \"ancient army\" mentioned in the verse can be seen as a metaphor for any group or individual who remains loyal and committed in the face of adversity..The kural verse:ஒலித்தக்கால் என்னாம் உவரி எலிப்பகைநாகம் உயிர்ப்பக் கெடும். ,translates to :Sea-like ratfoes roar What if? They perish at a cobra's whiff,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural is a testament to the power of true courage and strength. It uses the analogy of a swarm of rats roaring like a sea and a cobra to illustrate the difference between mere noise and real power. \n\nThe verse suggests that even if a multitude of rats (symbolizing the weak or the unrighteous) were to band together and roar like the sea, they would still perish at the mere hiss of a cobra (symbolizing the strong or the righteous). The cobra does not need to roar like the sea or display overt signs of power. Its mere presence and the hint of its strength are enough to make the multitude of rats scatter and perish. \n\nThis Kural, therefore, underlines the importance of genuine strength and courage, as opposed to empty bravado. It implies that true strength lies not in numbers or noise, but in the unwavering resolve and moral righteousness of an individual or a cause. It encourages us to adopt this real strength and warns of the futility of false bravado. \n\nThe verse also advises us not to underestimate the power of the righteous. Even when they are outnumbered, their inner strength and integrity can overcome any opposition. The cobra represents a righteous person who stands his/her ground in the face of adversity and is not swayed by the loud but empty threats of the unrighteous. \n\nIn essence, this Kural is a call to value genuine strength and courage over mere show of force. It reminds us that righteousness and moral courage are more powerful than numbers or noise..The kural verse:அழிவின்றி அறைபோகா தாகி வழிவந்தவன்க ணதுவே படை. ,translates to :The army guards its genial flame Not crushed, routed nor marred in name,and it's explantion is :The Kural 764 emphasizes on the qualities of a resilient and steadfast army. It suggests that an army is truly formidable when it has consistently stood its ground, without giving into defeat or swaying towards the enemy, regardless of the pressures or challenges it faces. The army's strength is not just in its numbers, but in its unwavering determination and courage that have been tested over time and have remained steadfast. Therefore, a truly potent army is one that shows unyielding bravery, does not succumb to destruction, and remains loyal without defecting to the enemy, even amid adversity. It is this unflinching courage and loyalty that define a real army according to this Thirukkural verse..The kural verse:கூற்றுடன்று மேல்வரினும் கூடி எதிர்நிற்கும்ஆற்ற லதுவே படை. ,translates to :The real army with rallied force Resists even Death-God fierce,and it's explantion is :Kural 765 explores the significance of unity and courage in an army. It states that a true army is one that can stand together and resist undeterred, even when faced with the most formidable danger or adversity, symbolized here by Yama, the Hindu god of death, advancing furiously. \n\nThe verse underscores the importance of collective strength and determination in an army. It advocates for unity, valor, and unwavering resolve under the most intimidating circumstances. The army that embodies these qualities is the one that truly deserves the name.\n\nThis Kural emphasizes the core military values of unity, bravery, and resilience. When an army possesses the determination to face even death (Yama) without fear or hesitation, it becomes invincible. This also parallels life where unity and courage in the face of adversity define true strength. \n\nMoreover, this verse also subtly hints at the transient nature of life (through the reference to Yama) and thus, underscores the virtue of fighting courageously, regardless of the outcome. This interpretation aligns with the warrior ethos prevalent in many cultures, where bravery and valor are valued above life itself..The kural verse:மறமானம் மாண்ட வழிச்செலவு தேற்றம்எனநான்கே ஏமம் படைக்கு. ,translates to :Manly army has merits four:- Stately-march, faith, honour, valour,and it's explantion is :Kural 766 emphasizes the four key virtues that form the cornerstone of a strong and successful army. These virtues are:\n\n1. Valour: The bravery and courage of the soldiers are paramount to the success of an army. This bravery is not just physical, but also mental, having the courage to face any challenge or adversary without fear.\n\n2. Honour: An army should uphold its honour, which refers to the respect and dignity it maintains through ethical conduct and unwavering loyalty. Honour is what drives a soldier to fight not just for survival, but for the principles they represent.\n\n3. Adherence to Tradition: This refers to the discipline and dedication of an army to follow the established and successful strategies of its predecessors. It suggests the importance of learning from history and the wisdom of those who came before.\n\n4. Trustworthiness: Lastly, an army's reliability or trustworthiness in the eyes of its leader is crucial. An army should be dependable, always ready to act for the welfare of its nation and its people, and never wavering from its duty.\n\nThese four virtues act as the protective shield of an army, ensuring its strength, unity, and effectiveness. They provide the moral and ethical framework within which an army operates, thereby securing its success and reputation..The kural verse:தார்தாங்கிச் செல்வது தானை தலைவந்தபோர்தாங்கும் தன்மை அறிந்து. ,translates to :Army sets on to face to foes Knowing how the trend of war goes,and it's explantion is :Kural 767 speaks about the characteristics of a formidable and successful army. The verse suggests that an army's strength is not measured by its size or physical power but rather the strategic knowledge and the skill to combat and neutralize an impending threat or attack. The ability to stand firm against the dust storm raised by a hostile force, symbolizes the capacity of the army to withstand the initial onslaught of the enemy and respond effectively.\n\nThe 'dust-van' or 'dust storm' metaphorically represents the initial surge or attack from the enemy. An experienced and well-prepared army would have the strategic knowledge to counteract this initial assault, thereby halting the enemy's momentum.\n\nIn essence, the verse emphasizes the importance of strategic knowledge and preparedness in warfare. An army, despite its physical prowess, will falter if it is not tactically prepared to handle the complexities of war. A truly victorious army is one that understands its own capabilities, anticipates the enemy's strategies, and successfully wards off attacks while advancing towards victory..The kural verse:அடல்தகையும் ஆற்றலும் இல்லெனினும் தானைபடைத்தகையால் பாடு பெறும். ,translates to :Army gains force by grand array Lacking in stay or dash in fray,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural suggests that even if an army lacks the courage to fight or the strength to endure, it can still gain recognition and respect through the grandeur of its appearance. It emphasizes the importance of presentation and outward appearance in the perception of power and strength.\n\nThe verse suggests that the splendor of an army's formation or its impressive appearance can provide a sense of grandeur and power, even if it lacks actual fighting prowess or resilience. This is akin to saying that well-organized and disciplined presentation can enhance the perceived strength or effectiveness of any group or organization, thereby influencing the way others perceive and react to it.\n\nIn a deeper sense, this verse can also be interpreted as a commentary on society's tendency to value appearances and external show of strength over actual capability and resilience. It points out that sometimes, the façade of strength can give an impression of power, even in the absence of real strength or courage. \n\nHowever, this should not be mistaken as an endorsement of showiness over substance. It is more of an observation of human nature and societal tendencies. The true strength of an army, or any organization for that matter, lies in its courage, resilience and the ability to perform under pressure.\n\nIn a broader context, this verse can also be applied to individuals, suggesting that one's outward appearance and demeanor can influence how others perceive their strength and capabilities. It serves as a reminder that appearances can be deceiving, and one should not solely rely on outward appearances to judge the strength or capability of others..The kural verse:சிறுமையும் செல்லாத் துனியும் வறுமையும்இல்லாயின் வெல்லும் படை. ,translates to :Army shall win if it is free From weakness, aversion, poverty,and it's explantion is :Kural 769 asserts that for an army to be victorious, it must be free from three key detrimental conditions - diminution, irremediable aversion, and poverty. \n\nThe first condition, diminution, refers to a decrease in the size or strength of the army. This could be due to various reasons such as casualties, desertion, or lack of recruitment. An army that is consistently strong and not prone to reduction in its ranks stands a better chance of achieving victory. \n\nThe second condition, irremediable aversion, refers to a deep-seated resentment or dislike, particularly towards the leader or the cause for which the army is fighting. If the troops harbor such feelings, it can lead to lack of morale, motivation, and ultimately, failure. Hence, a harmonious relationship between the leadership and the soldiers, and a shared belief in the cause is essential for victory.\n\nThe third condition, poverty, suggests the lack of necessary resources to sustain the army - such as food, weapons, and other supplies. An army that is well-provisioned is better equipped to endure long battles and campaigns, and therefore, more likely to be successful.\n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes the importance of unity, morale, and resourcefulness in an army's path to victory. An army that is cohesive, motivated, and well-equipped is one that can overcome its foes..The kural verse:நிலைமக்கள் சால உடைத்தெனினும் தானைதலைமக்கள் இல்வழி இல். ,translates to :With troops in large numbers on rolls Army can't march missing gen'rals,and it's explantion is :Kural 770 emphasizes the crucial role of leadership in any group or organization, in this case, an army. The verse captures the essence of leadership by stating that even if an army has a large number of committed and strong soldiers, it will not be able to sustain itself without the guidance and strategy provided by its generals or leaders. \n\nThis wisdom applies to all spheres of life, not just warfare. In any organization, while the hard work and dedication of its members are essential, the role of a good leader who can guide, motivate, and strategize is equally, if not more, important. The leader is the one who plans, makes critical decisions, and steers the team towards its goal.\n\nIn absence of such leadership, even the most competent of teams can falter and fail to achieve their potential. This is because while the team members may excel in their individual roles, they require a leader to unite their efforts and direct them towards a common goal. Therefore, the verse underscores the importance of effective leadership in the success of any endeavor..The kural verse:என்னைமுன் நில்லன்மின் தெவ்விர் பலரென்னைமுன்நின்று கல்நின் றவர். ,translates to :Stand not before my chief, O foes! Many who stood, in stones repose,and it's explantion is :Kural 771 is a powerful verse that uses metaphorical language to emphasize the might and invincibility of a great leader. The verse is spoken from the perspective of a loyal warrior or follower, who is issuing a strong warning to his enemies.\n\nThe verse says, \"O my foes, stand not before my leader; (for) many are those who did so but afterwards stood (in the shape of) statues.\" The reference to enemies standing as statues after confronting the leader is a metaphorical way of saying that the enemies were so completely defeated or overwhelmed by the leader's strength and power that they were left stunned, immobile, or lifeless - like statues.\n\nThis Kural essentially serves as a warning to enemies, advising against underestimating or challenging the power and capabilities of a strong leader. It underlines the consequences of such an action - utter defeat, and metaphorically, a transformation into statues. The verse thus reinforces the theme of respect for leadership and power, while also emphasizing the potential dangers of attempting to challenge such power without adequate strength or preparation.\n\nThe cultural context here is likely the battlefield, where a great leader's prowess and strategic acumen ensure victory, leaving enemies defeated and immobilized. But the verse's wisdom is universal and can be applied to any situation where one is cautioned against challenging a powerful authority, be it in politics, business, or any other field..The kural verse:கான முயலெய்த அம்பினில் யானைபிழைத்தவேல் ஏந்தல் இனிது. ,translates to :To lift a lance that missed a tusker Is prouder than shaft that hit a hare,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse (Kural 772) emphasizes the importance of taking on larger and more challenging tasks rather than settling for easy victories. The verse uses an allegorical comparison where the elephant represents a big, challenging task, and the hare stands for an easy, insignificant task. \n\nThe verse suggests that it is more honorable and satisfying to attempt tackling an elephant (a challenging task) and miss, than to target a hare (an insignificant task) and succeed. This is because even if the dart misses the elephant, the merit lies in the courage and ambition to take on a formidable challenge. In contrast, hitting a hare, which is a much easier target, offers little satisfaction or honor as it doesn't require much effort or skill.\n\nThis moral guidance encourages one to aim high, take risks, and embrace challenges, instead of settling for easy but less rewarding tasks. It promotes the idea that the value lies in the attempt and the courage to face challenges, not just in the success of hitting an easy target.\n\nThe verse is a reminder that true accomplishment comes from striving for significant goals, even if the result is not always successful. It is the effort, courage, and the will to take on challenging tasks that brings true honor and satisfaction..The kural verse:பேராண்மை என்ப தறுகண்ஒன் றுற்றக்கால்ஊராண்மை மற்றதன் எஃகு. ,translates to :Valour is fight with fierce courage Mercy to the fallen is its edge,and it's explantion is :The verse essentially emphasizes the concept of chivalry and magnanimity, especially in relation to one's enemies. It suggests that while bravery and valour in facing an enemy is commendable, the highest form of courage is displayed when one extends a helping hand to their foe in times of distress.\n\nIn the first half of the verse, the author acknowledges that unflinching bravery in the face of an adversary is indeed a sign of great valour. This form of courage, which is devoid of fear and full of determination, is often praised and respected.\n\nHowever, in the second half of the verse, the author introduces an even higher form of bravery. He suggests that when an enemy is facing hardship or calamity, to offer assistance and aid to them is the ultimate act of courage. This act not only requires physical bravery but also a great deal of moral strength and character, as it involves putting aside personal animosities and grudges for the sake of compassion and humanity.\n\nThus, the verse extols the virtues of empathy, compassion, and magnanimity, even in the face of enmity, thereby promoting a higher moral standard of bravery and courage..The kural verse:கைவேல் களிற்றொடு போக்கி வருபவன்மெய்வேல் பறியா நகும். ,translates to :At the tusker he flings his lance One in body smiles another chance,and it's explantion is :Kural 774 is a deep metaphorical verse that highlights the courage, resilience, and determination of a true hero in the face of adversity and danger. \n\nThe verse talks about a brave warrior who hurls his spear at an elephant (a symbol for a formidable challenge or enemy) and then goes in search of another spear to continue his fight. In the process, if he finds a spear lodged in his own body, he doesn't wince in pain or retreat. Instead, he plucks it out and uses it as his weapon, laughing in the face of danger. \n\nThe warrior's action of laughing signifies his fearless spirit, his defiance of pain, and his readiness to turn even adversities into tools for victory. It is a display of his unyielding spirit and an affirmation of his indomitable will to fight on, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nIn a broader context, this Kural encourages us to face life's challenges head-on, and to never give up, no matter how dire the situation may be. It encourages us to use the adversities we encounter as stepping stones towards success. The pain we experience should not deter us, but instead, drive us forward towards our goals..The kural verse:விழித்தகண் வேல்கொண டெறிய அழித்திமைப்பின்ஒட்டன்றோ வன்க ணவர்க்கு. ,translates to :When lances dart if heroes wink \\\"It is a rout\\\" the world will think,and it's explantion is :Kural 775 is a reflection on courage and fearlessness, especially in the face of danger. The verse suggests that for the truly valiant, even the reflexive act of blinking or flinching when a weapon is hurled at them by their enemy is considered a defeat. The verse indicates the high standards of bravery and fearlessness expected from valiant warriors.\n\nThe cultural context here is the valorization of bravery in traditional Tamil society, where warriors were expected to face danger unflinchingly. The moral interpretation of this verse could be the expectation of fearlessness and unwavering commitment in the face of adversity, not just in the battlefield, but in life's struggles as well. \n\nHowever, the verse is not advocating recklessness. Instead, it emphasizes the mental fortitude and courage required when dealing with threats or challenges, a quality that is highly revered in warriors and leaders. Even the smallest sign of fear or hesitation, like blinking at the sight of an incoming threat, is seen as a sign of weakness or defeat. Therefore, this verse underscores the necessity of courage, stoicism, and resilience in the face of adversity..The kural verse:விழுப்புண் படாதநாள் எல்லாம் வழுக்கினுள்வைக்கும்தன் நாளை எடுத்து. ,translates to :The brave shall deem the days as vain Which did not battle-wounds sustain,and it's explantion is :Kural 776 is a reflection on the valor and indomitable spirit of a warrior or hero. \n\nIt essentially conveys that a true hero perceives days without battles and challenges as wasted. In other words, he sees the absence of hardship or struggle, symbolized by severe wounds, as a lack of opportunity to demonstrate his courage and strength. \n\nSuch a mindset indicates the hero's commitment to his duty, his willingness to face difficulties head-on, and his relentless pursuit of valorous deeds. It suggests that the honor and glory derived from overcoming adversities are of such importance to the hero that a day without them is seen as unproductive or wasted.\n\nAlso, this Kural highlights the virtue of courage and the readiness to confront trials, which is an essential quality for anyone who aspires to achieve greatness in life, not just for warriors. \n\nIn summary, Thiruvalluvar, through this Kural, teaches us the value of embracing challenges and adversity as opportunities for growth and self-improvement..The kural verse:சுழலும் இசைவேண்டி வேண்டா உயிரார்கழல்யாப்புக் காரிகை நீர்த்து. ,translates to :Their anklets aloud jingle their name Who sacrifice their life for fame,and it's explantion is :Kural 777 emphasizes the valor and unwavering ambition of warriors who strive for fame and glory above their own lives. The analogy of fastening an ankle-ring or a 'kazhal' here is symbolic of the warrior's readiness for the battle. The 'kazhal' is a prominent part of a warrior's attire in the Tamil culture, often adorned before stepping into the battlefield. \n\nThe Kural is essentially praising those warriors who, desiring widespread fame and reputation, are undeterred by the risk to their lives. These warriors don't fear death and are prepared to sacrifice their life for honor and glory. When such warriors fasten the ankle-ring, it is not just an adornment but a symbol of their bravery, commitment, and their readiness to face any challenge in the pursuit of their objective.\n\nThe verse is a tribute to the selflessness and courage of these warriors, emphasizing that their pursuit of glory is so strong that it overshadows the instinct of self-preservation. It extols the virtue of placing duty and honor above one's own life, a characteristic that is deeply admired and respected. It highlights a key concept in Tamil valor - the pursuit of eternal fame even at the cost of one's life..The kural verse:உறின்உயிர் அஞ்சா மறவர் இறைவன்செறினும் சீர்குன்றல் இலர். ,translates to :The king may chide, they pursue strife; They fear loss of glory; not life,and it's explantion is :The verse 778 from Thirukkural talks about the unyielding spirit of true warriors. These warriors are characterized by their fearlessness towards the potential loss of life in the battlefield. Their courage and dedication towards their duty are so profound that they would not back down or lessen their fervor, even if the king himself prohibits them from fighting.\n\nThe Kural emphasizes the noble quality of valor, where a warrior is revered not merely for his physical strength, but also for his indomitable spirit and commitment to his duty, irrespective of the risks involved. This bravery extends to the point where they would willingly defy even the highest authority, if it meant compromising their duty or honor.\n\nThis verse also serves as a metaphor for life, suggesting that true dedication and commitment towards one's duty or goal remain unwavering, regardless of the obstacles or discouragements faced. This is a significant tenet in both personal and professional life, highlighting the importance of perseverance and courage.\n\nIn a broader cultural context, this Kural reflects the values of courage, duty, and honor that were held in high regard in ancient Tamil society, especially among warriors. This principle can be applied universally, encouraging us to stand firm in our convictions and actions, irrespective of the challenges or opposition we may encounter..The kural verse:இழைத்தது இகவாமைச் சாவாரை யாரேபிழைத்தது ஒறுக்கிற் பவர். ,translates to :Who will blame the heroes that lose Their lives in war to keep their vows?,and it's explantion is :Kural 779 emphasizes the nobility and valor of those who stand by their word or oath, even at the cost of their own life. The verse questions, \"Who would dare to reproach or criticize those who have died upholding their pledge?\"\n\nThe essence of this Kural is about fulfilling one's commitments, a virtue highly regarded in the Tamil culture. It underlines the importance of integrity and the concept of 'word is bond', a principle deeply rooted in the Tamil ethos. \n\nThe verse also encapsulates the valor of warriors who, in ancient times, would pledge to either win the battle or die trying. Such courageous individuals, who sealed their oath with their death, are beyond reproach according to Valluvar. Their honor and bravery are to be revered, not criticized or belittled. \n\nThe Kural, therefore, imparts the message that keeping one's word, even in the face of death, is the ultimate sign of honor and bravery and no one has the right to scorn or belittle such individuals. It is a call to value integrity and steadfast commitment, and to honor those who embody such virtues. It is a timeless message applicable in all walks of life, not just in the battlefield, but also in personal, professional, and societal contexts..The kural verse:புரந்தார்கண் நீர்மல்கச் சாகிற்பின் சாக்காடுஇரந்துகோள் தக்கது உடைத்து. ,translates to :Such a death shall be prayed for Which draws the the tears of the ruler,and it's explantion is :Kural 780 celebrates the dignity and honor of a heroic death, especially when it moves the ruler who has been protected by the brave to tears. The verse emphasizes that such a death on the battlefield is so noble and honorable that it is worth seeking, even to the point of begging for it.\n\nThe verse brings forth the cultural concept of valor and sacrifice, where the death of a brave warrior is seen as a moment of supreme glory, especially when it elicits emotions from the ruler he has protected. The tears of the ruler can be seen as a symbol of the ultimate recognition and honor given to the hero for his bravery, sacrifice, and commitment to his duty.\n\nThe verse also reflects the values of loyalty, bravery, and heroism, which were held in high regard in the ancient Tamil society. It illustrates the idea that a warrior's life is not measured by its length, but by its depth and the impact it leaves behind.\n\nTherefore, the verse implies that a heroic death that brings tears to the eyes of a ruler is not a moment of sorrow, but a moment of ultimate honor and glory. This kind of death is so dignified and commendable that it is worth obtaining even by begging..The kural verse:செயற்கரிய யாவுள நட்பின் அதுபோல்வினைக்கரிய யாவுள காப்பு. ,translates to :Like friendship what's so hard to gain? That guards one against acts villain?,and it's explantion is :Kural 781 addresses the power and significance of friendship in our lives. The verse states, \"What so sure defence 'gainst all that foe can do?\" which means that there is no better defense against adversities than the strength of a true friendship. \n\nThe verse suggests that establishing and maintaining a meaningful friendship is a difficult task, akin to a significant accomplishment, but once achieved, it serves as a strong shield against all harms that could come your way. It emphasizes that no other action provides as much protection as a strong bond of friendship. \n\nThe verse underscores the importance of friendship in our lives. It is not merely a relationship but a fortress that protects us from harm. It requires effort and dedication to build a strong friendship, but the returns are invaluable. In essence, this verse encourages us to cherish and nurture our friendships as they are our greatest defense against adversities. \n\nIn the cultural context of Thiru Kural, this verse also reflects the traditional Indian values of camaraderie and mutual support. It highlights the belief that relationships, such as friendships, are not just social constructs but a vital part of our defense mechanism against hardships..The kural verse:நிறைநீர நீரவர் கேண்மை பிறைமதிப்பின்னீர பேதையார் நட்பு. ,translates to :Good friendship shines like waxing moon, The bad withers like waning moon,and it's explantion is :Kural 782 speaks about the nature of friendship when formed with the wise and the foolish. The verse compares the friendship with wise people to the waxing phase of the moon, where it grows from a tiny crescent to a full moon, indicating that such relationships gradually flourish, deepen, and become more substantial over time. It signifies that the bond with intelligent individuals tends to mature and strengthen progressively, offering more value, understanding, and satisfaction as time passes.\n\nOn the other hand, friendships with foolish people are compared to the waning phase of the moon, which gradually diminishes from a full moon to a new moon. Such relationships, much like the dwindling moon, start strong but eventually fade and decrease in value. This comparison infers that a relationship with an unwise person, despite an enthusiastic or promising start, can gradually lose its worth, becoming less satisfying and potentially detrimental.\n\nThe essence of this verse is to convey the idea that the quality of our friendships, like the phases of the moon, is significantly determined by the wisdom or folly of those we choose to associate with. Hence, it emphasizes the importance of discernment in choosing our companions..The kural verse:நவில்தொறும் நூல்நயம் போலும் பயில்தொறும்பண்புடை யாளர் தொடர்பு. ,translates to :Like taste in books good friendship grows The more one moves the more he knows,and it's explantion is :The Kural 783 discusses the nature of friendship with noble individuals. In this verse, Valluvar compares the growth and enrichment of such a friendship to the process of learning from a scholarly text. \n\nJust as the pleasure and enlightenment one derives from a profound book increases with more reading and understanding, so too does the delight increase in the company of the righteous and virtuous as the friendship deepens. This is because, with each interaction, one gets to appreciate their good qualities more, learn from their wisdom, and be positively influenced by their character. \n\nJust as learning is not a one-time act, but a continuous process that adds value to the learner, friendship with noble individuals is also not a stagnant relationship. It continually evolves, deepens, and becomes more enjoyable and beneficial.\n\nThis Kural emphasizes the importance of choosing friends wisely, and the value of nurturing relationships with those who embody virtue, wisdom, and good character. These friendships not only provide joy and companionship but also play a crucial role in one's personal development and moral growth..The kural verse:நகுதற் பொருட்டன்று நட்டல் மிகுதிக்கண்மேற்செனறு இடித்தற் பொருட்டு. ,translates to :Not to laugh is friendship made But to hit when faults exceed,and it's explantion is :Kural 784 essentially underscores the true essence of friendship. It emphasizes that friendship isn't merely about sharing laughter and enjoying good times together. The real purpose of friendship lies not in the surface-level pleasantries, but in the ability to reprimand or correct one another when they stray off the right path.\n\nThe verse suggests that in true friendship, one should be willing to offer \"sharp rebukes\" if a friend commits a wrong or transgresses against moral or social norms. This act of rebuke is not done out of hostility, but out of the genuine concern for the friend's well-being and desire to see them improve. This is what sets apart a real friend from a mere acquaintance - the courage to point out faults and the caring intention to help the friend rectify them.\n\nIn a broader interpretation, this verse signifies that friendships are not just for sharing happy moments, but more importantly, they are for helping each other grow and become better individuals. It underscores the need for honesty, accountability, and constructive criticism in a true friendship. It appreciates the value of those friends who are willing to confront us with our faults and guide us towards self-improvement..The kural verse:புணர்ச்சி பழகுதல் வேண்டா உணர்ச்சிதான்நட்பாங் கிழமை தரும். ,translates to :No close living nor clasping grip Friendship's feeling heart's fellowship,and it's explantion is :Kural 785 emphasizes that physical proximity and frequent interaction are not prerequisites for establishing and maintaining a friendship. It underlines the importance of mutual understanding and shared values as the cornerstone of a strong and lasting bond. This verse suggests that friendship can thrive even in the absence of constant contact or interaction, as long as there is a deep and profound understanding between the parties involved. \n\nIn essence, it proposes that the essence of friendship is not about \"living together or frequent intercourse\", but rather about \"mutual understanding\" that can create a claim for it. It implies that true friendship transcends physical boundaries and temporal structures, and is rather, a connection of souls that understand and resonate with each other.\n\nThe cultural context of the verse highlights the Tamil tradition of valuing emotional and spiritual connections over physical and superficial ones, emphasizing the depth of relationships.\n\nThe moral interpretation of the verse is that true friendship is based on mutual understanding, empathy, and shared values. It advises that we should seek friends who understand us and with whom we share a deep connection, rather than simply those who are physically close to us or with whom we frequently interact..The kural verse:முகநக நட்பது நட்பன்று நெஞ்சத்துஅகநக நட்பது நட்பு. ,translates to :Friendship is not more smile on face It is the smiling heart's embrace,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural talks about the true essence of friendship. The poet, Thiruvalluvar, delineates the difference between superficial and genuine friendship.\n\nThe verse states that the friendship which is only evident in the outward smiles of the face is not real friendship. This kind of friendship is superficial, temporary, and often based on external factors. It might be driven by personal gains, societal status, or any other transient benefits. Such a friendship is not grounded in the depth of the heart and can wane over time or due to changing circumstances.\n\nOn the contrary, true friendship is deeply rooted in the heart. It's not merely expressed through visible smiles, but it's a profound affection that resides in the core of the heart. True friendship is not influenced by external circumstances or personal benefits. It is steadfast, sincere, and enduring. It's not merely about outward expressions but internal feelings and emotions.\n\nHence, the poet emphasizes that real friendship is much more than just smiles and pleasantries. It's about the unfeigned love and affection that resides in the heart, making the bond strong and everlasting. This verse encourages us to value and nurture such friendships, which bring true joy and fulfillment..The kural verse:அழிவி னவைநீக்கி ஆறுய்த்து அழிவின்கண்அல்லல் உழப்பதாம் நட்பு. ,translates to :From ruin friendship saves and shares The load of pain and right path shows,and it's explantion is :Kural 787 provides a profound insight into the true essence of friendship. This verse states that a real friend is someone who not only guides their companion away from harmful or destructive paths but also leads them towards virtuous and beneficial ones. True friendship is not only about sharing joyful moments, but it also involves sharing the burden of hardships and sorrows that one might encounter. \n\nIn the cultural context, this Kural emphasizes the importance of companionship and guidance in one's life. It signifies that a friend's role is not just limited to companionship but extends to moral guidance and emotional support. It underscores the idea that friendship is not about enjoying the good times together, but also about facing and overcoming the adversities together. \n\nIn terms of moral interpretation, this Kural teaches the value of empathy and assistance in friendship. It encourages individuals to be supportive and considerate, to share the pain of their friends, and to help them navigate through their struggles. This Kural, thus, serves as a moral guideline for nurturing and sustaining meaningful friendships..The kural verse:உடுக்கை இழந்தவன் கைபோல ஆங்கேஇடுக்கண் களைவதாம் நட்பு. ,translates to :Friendship hastens help in mishaps Like hands picking up dress that slips,and it's explantion is :This Kural (verse 788) provides a beautiful analogy to depict the essence of true friendship. It compares a genuine friend to the spontaneous response of a person's hand when their garment loosens and begins to fall in a public gathering. \n\nIn the Tamil society, it is considered inappropriate and embarrassing if one's traditional garment (like a saree or a dhoti) slips off. The instant reaction of the person would be to catch the garment and secure it, preventing any potential humiliation. This action is immediate and automatic, without any conscious thought or hesitation. \n\nThiruvalluvar, the author of Thiru Kural, uses this analogy to describe a true friend's response when their friend is in distress or trouble. A sincere friend would rush instantly to help, without any second thoughts or procrastination, just like the hand moving swiftly to catch the slipping garment. This immediate and selfless act of support and assistance is the hallmark of genuine friendship. \n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes the need for friends to be empathetic, prompt, and proactive in standing by each other during challenging times, thus defining the true nature and value of friendship..The kural verse:நட்பிற்கு வீற்றிருக்கை யாதெனின் கொட்பின்றிஒல்லும்வாய் ஊன்றும் நிலை. ,translates to :Friendship is enthroned on the strength That always helps with utmost warmth,and it's explantion is :Kural 789 speaks about the true essence of friendship. The author articulates that friendship can be considered at its zenith when it has the capability to assist one, regardless of the circumstances, and at all times. This support extends to all areas of life, whether in the pursuit of virtue or wealth. \n\nThe beauty of this verse lies in its emphasis on the constancy and unwavering nature of true friendship. It postulates that a genuine friend will not show a change of heart and will stand by one's side, offering help whenever possible. This could be in the form of moral support, guidance, or even material assistance.\n\nIn essence, this verse underscores the notion that a true friend is not a fair-weather companion but someone who will remain steadfast and supportive, regardless of the trials and tribulations one faces. True friendship, according to this verse, is about reliability, consistency, and the willingness to extend help in every possible way..The kural verse:இனையர் இவரெமக்கு இன்னம்யாம் என்றுபுனையினும் புல்லென்னும் நட்பு. ,translates to :\\\"Such we are and such they are!\\\" Ev'n this boast will friendship mar,and it's explantion is :Kural 790 delves into the nature of friendship and the influence of false praise. In this verse, Thiruvalluvar warns against excessive flattery or praise between friends, stating that it can diminish the value and depth of the friendship. \n\nThe verse emphasizes that friendships should not be based on false pretenses or superficial praise. When friends excessively compliment each other, stating how close their bond is or how much they mean to each other, it may create a facade of deep connection. However, such acts can cause the friendship to appear shallow and insincere. \n\nTrue friendship, according to Thiruvalluvar, is not about outwardly displaying affection or closeness but maintaining sincerity, honesty, and mutual respect. Thus, the verse advises against empty praises and encourages genuine and meaningful interactions to uphold the integrity of a friendship.\n\nIn a broader context, this verse can be seen as a critique of societal norms where superficial praises are often used to maintain relationships. The poet emphasizes the importance of maintaining authenticity in relationships..The kural verse:நாடாது நட்டலிற் கேடில்லை நட்டபின்வீடில்லை நட்பாள் பவர்க்கு. ,translates to :Than testless friendship nought is worse For contacts formed will scarcely cease,and it's explantion is :The verse underlines the significance of prudence and discernment in choosing friends. It states that once a friendship is formed, it becomes difficult for genuine individuals to disengage from it, no matter how flawed or harmful it turns out to be. Therefore, it warns that forming friendships without due diligence and understanding of the other person's character could lead to consequences worse than any other harm. \n\nThe essence of this verse is a timeless piece of wisdom. It underscores the importance of knowing and understanding people before forming close bonds with them. It also reflects the cultural emphasis on loyalty and steadfastness in relationships, a characteristic that is deeply valued in the Tamil culture. \n\nIn essence, the verse is a cautionary statement about hastily formed friendships and the potential harm they can cause. It encourages one to take time, be observant, and use their judgement before forming deep and lasting friendships..The kural verse:ஆய்ந்தாய்ந்து கொள்ளாதான் கேண்மை கடைமுறைதான்சாம் துயரம் தரும். ,translates to :Friendship made without frequent test Shall end in grief and death at last,and it's explantion is :Kural 792 speaks about the importance of thorough examination before establishing a friendship. It warns that a hastily formed friendship, without proper understanding and evaluation of the person's character and virtues, can lead to regret and pain at the end, possibly even to the extent of causing one's demise.\n\nThis verse emphasizes the need for discernment and careful judgement in choosing friends. It suggests that one must invest time and effort in understanding the other person's character, virtues, and flaws before forming a deep bond.\n\nThe underlying wisdom is that relationships formed without sufficient understanding can lead to misunderstandings, betrayal, and heartache in the long run. Therefore, one should exercise caution and prudence in forming friendships, ensuring they are based on mutual respect, understanding, and shared values. This concept resonates with the famous English saying, \"Look before you leap\"..The kural verse:குணமும் குடிமையும் குற்றமும் குன்றாஇனனும் அறிந்தியாக்க நட்பு. ,translates to :Temper, descent, defects and kins Trace well and take companions,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of careful discernment in choosing one's friends. It advises thorough understanding of a person's character, lineage, faults, and associations before establishing a friendship.\n\n\"Character\" refers to a person's moral and ethical qualities. It's crucial to understand if a person's character aligns with ours, as this lays the foundation for mutual respect and understanding in a friendship.\n\n\"Birth\" or \"lineage\" in this context does not suggest discrimination based on caste or social status. Instead, it means understanding the values and principles ingrained in a person through their familial and cultural upbringing. This can greatly influence a person's behavior and thought processes.\n\n\"Defects\" refers to a person's shortcomings or faults. No one is perfect, and everyone has their own flaws. Recognizing these in a potential friend is important to prevent any surprises or disappointments in the future.\n\nFinally, \"the whole of one's relations\" refers to understanding a person's circle of influence - their friends, family, and associations. This provides insight into the kind of company a person keeps and the influences that shape their behavior and attitudes.\n\nThus, this Kural emphasizes the importance of careful and thorough understanding of a person before forming a close friendship with them. This thoughtful approach to friendship ensures a strong and durable bond based on mutual respect, understanding, and shared values..The kural verse:குடிப்பிறந்து தன்கண் பழிநாணு வானைக்கொடுத்தும் கொளல்வேண்டும் நட்பு. ,translates to :Take as good friend at any price The nobly born who shun disgrace,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural emphasizes the value of friendship with those who come from good families and have a deep-seated fear of committing wrongdoings or accumulating guilt. \n\nThe verse suggests that such friendships are so precious that they are worth acquiring even if one has to pay for them. This is because individuals who are born into good families and have a strong sense of morality often uphold high ethical standards. They are likely to influence their friends positively, fostering virtuous behaviors and preventing them from straying down the wrong path. \n\nThis verse does not literally advocate buying friendships but stresses the importance of being in the company of the virtuous. It encourages us to seek out and cherish relationships with those who value moral integrity and come from a background where these values are deeply ingrained. It reminds us that the company we keep can significantly influence our character and actions. Therefore, being in the company of the virtuous is considered an investment worth making. \n\nIn the broader cultural context, this verse also reflects the traditional Indian emphasis on the concepts of \"satsang\" or \"good company\", highlighting the importance of being around people who encourage and exemplify moral and ethical living..The kural verse:அழச்சொல்லி அல்லது இடித்து வழக்கறியவல்லார்நடபு ஆய்ந்து கொளல். ,translates to :Who make you weep and chide wrong trends And lead you right are worthy friends,and it's explantion is :Kural 795 emphasizes the importance of wise and honest companionship in our lives. The verse advises us to seek and secure friendships with those who are brave enough to speak the truth, even if it is harsh or painful. Such people are essential because they have the courage to critique you for a wrongful act before its execution, making you reconsider your decision, or rebuke you severely after it's done, making you realize the gravity of your mistake. \n\nThey possess the wisdom to guide and teach you about the ways of the world, helping you navigate life's complexities. Such friendships are not just comforting but also enlightening, pushing us towards betterment and growth. The verse urges us to value these friendships as they play an instrumental role in molding our character and guiding us on the path of righteousness. \n\nIn essence, the kural propounds the virtue of having friends who are not just companions, but also guides and well-wishers, who have the courage to correct us when we are wrong and the wisdom to guide us right..The kural verse:கேட்டினும் உண்டோர் உறுதி கிளைஞரைநீட்டி அளப்பதோர் கோல். ,translates to :Is there a test like misfortune A rod to measure out kinsmen?,and it's explantion is :Kural 796 is a profound verse that explores the silver lining that can be found even in times of adversity. It suggests that even in the face of ruin or disaster, there lies an opportunity to gauge the authenticity and depth of one's relationships.\n\nIn a more elaborate sense, this verse posits that adversities or challenging times can serve as a measuring rod to fully comprehend the true nature and loyalty of one's relations or friends. It is during these times of hardship, one can discern the difference between fair-weather friends and those who stand by you when the going gets tough.\n\nThe verse does not promote misfortune, but rather it encourages us to find the hidden value within it. It advises us to use the tough times as a tool to evaluate our relationships and understand their true worth. This concept is not just relevant to the social context, but also to personal growth, as adversities are often seen as the best teachers. \n\nIn essence, this Thiru Kural verse teaches us the importance of resilience and the ability to find good even in bad situations, particularly in the context of understanding the depth and authenticity of our relationships..The kural verse:ஊதியம் என்பது ஒருவற்குப் பேதையார்கேண்மை ஒரீஇ விடல். ,translates to :Keep off contacts with fools; that is The greatest gain so say the wise,and it's explantion is :Kural 797 emphasizes the value of discernment in one's social relationships. The verse indicates that distancing oneself from those who lack wisdom or understanding can be considered a gain, rather than a loss. It suggests that the association with fools can lead to unnecessary troubles, misunderstandings, and harm, thus making it advantageous to sever such connections.\n\nThis Kural advises to be selective in our friendships and associates, underscoring the importance of surrounding oneself with wise and insightful individuals who can contribute positively to one's life. The wisdom here is not just intellectual but also moral and ethical wisdom. It encourages us to seek companions who can guide us towards virtuous paths, rather than those who may lead us astray. \n\nIn essence, the verse sends a strong message about the impact of our social circle on our personal growth and development, advising us to choose our friends wisely. It asserts that it's indeed a gain to renounce the friendship of fools, as it prevents the negative influence from impacting one's life..The kural verse:உள்ளற்க உள்ளம் சிறுகுவ கொள்ளற்கஅல்லற்கண் ஆற்றறுப்பார் நட்பு. ,translates to :Off with thoughts that depress the heart Off with friends that in woe depart,and it's explantion is :Kural 798 emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive state of mind and discerning relationships in one's life. The verse advises against engaging in thoughts or actions that would dampen one's spirit or diminish enthusiasm. This could refer to negative self-talk, self-defeating behaviours, or engaging in activities that bring distress or unhappiness.\n\nSimultaneously, the verse also warns against forming friendships with individuals who are likely to abandon you during times of adversity. Such fair-weather friends are detrimental to one's mental and emotional well-being. They offer support and companionship only during good times, but they disappear when you need them the most. Such relationships are not genuine and can lead to disappointment and emotional pain.\n\nThe underlying message of the verse is the importance of mental resilience and wisdom in choosing relationships. It encourages maintaining a positive mindset and surrounding oneself with true friends who stand by you in both good and difficult times. This contributes to personal growth, emotional stability, and a fulfilling life..The kural verse:கெடுங்காலைக் கைவிடுவார் கேண்மை அடுங்காலைஉள்ளினும் உள்ளஞ் சுடும். ,translates to :Friends who betray at ruin's brink Burn our mind ev'n at death to think,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse speaks about the nature of fair-weather friends and the impact they have on one's life. The verse highlights the intense emotional pain experienced when remembering those who abandoned us in times of trouble or adversity. \n\nThe verse metaphorically uses the concept of 'burning' to express the deep hurt and disillusionment caused by the desertion of friends when we needed them the most. It suggests that the memory of such friends is so painful that it continues to torment us even at the time of death, a moment when one typically reflects on their life experiences. \n\nThe Kural unambiguously conveys the message that friendships that are not tested in adversity are not genuine and the realization of their false nature hurts deeply. It advises us to value true friendships that stand the test of adversity and to be wary of fair-weather friends who may abandon us in difficult times. \n\nIt underscores the importance of loyalty, steadfastness, and the true meaning of friendship, which should be constant and unwavering regardless of circumstances..The kural verse:மருவுக மாசற்றார் கேண்மைஒன் றீத்தும்ஒருவுக ஒப்பிலார் நட்பு. ,translates to :The blameless ones as friends embarace; Give something and give up the base,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse emphasizes the importance of discerning the nature of the people we choose to associate with. The verse advises us to foster friendships with those who are pure in heart and free from deceit or ill-will. Such individuals usually possess a high moral character and their company often influences us positively, leading to personal growth and ethical conduct.\n\nOn the other hand, the verse strongly advises us to avoid associating with those who do not align with universal moral principles or societal norms. These individuals can have a negative influence on us, leading to unwholesome behavior or harmful consequences. The verse goes as far as suggesting that if such a relationship cannot be avoided, it is better to break it off, even if it requires giving a gift or making a sacrifice to do so.\n\nThe verse highlights the wisdom of choosing our friends wisely, as our associations often shape our character, behaviors, and ultimately, our life's journey. It also emphasizes the significance of upholding moral integrity over superficial relationships..The kural verse:பழைமை எனப்படுவது யாதெனின் யாதும்கிழமையைக் கீழ்ந்திடா நட்பு. ,translates to :That friendship is good amity Which restrains not one's liberty,and it's explantion is :Thiru Kural 801 explores the concept of old and intimate friendship. It considers a friendship to be truly longstanding if it can withstand any actions or behaviors that emerge from the rights and privileges that come with such closeness. \n\nThis Kural emphasizes that in a true and deep friendship, certain actions performed due to the familiarity and depth of the relationship should not harm or strain it. This is because these actions are often not intended to be harmful, but rather, they stem from the comfort and ease that comes with an old and intimate friendship.\n\nIn essence, the Kural suggests that intimate friendships, which have stood the test of time, should be resilient enough to withstand any misunderstandings or minor grievances that may arise from the rights of longstanding intimacy. Such friendships must be understanding and forgiving, cherishing the bond more than the minor fallacies that may come with intimacy and familiarity. \n\nIn the cultural context, this verse underlines the importance of maintaining relationships and the value of understanding and forgiveness in a longstanding friendship. It suggests that the mark of a true friend is someone who can overlook minor faults and continue to nurture the bond..The kural verse:நட்பிற் குறுப்புக் கெழுதகைமை மற்றதற்குஉப்பாதல் சான்றோர் கடன். ,translates to :Friendship's heart is freedom close; Wise men's duty is such to please,and it's explantion is :Kural 802 asserts the importance of acknowledging and appreciating the privileges that come with friendship. The verse posits that true friendship extends beyond simple companionship, but rather includes actions performed through the intimate rights that friendship establishes. These actions are not obligations, but the fruits of affection and trust that friends have for one another.\n\nThe verse further emphasizes that it's the duty of the wise to recognize and value these rights of intimacy. Being pleased with the privileges that come with friendship, whether it's the freedom to offer unsolicited advice, the liberty to intrude upon each other's personal space, or the entitlement to demand time and attention – is a sign of wisdom. This pleasure is not derived from the act of taking advantage but from the mutual respect, trust, and understanding that forms the bedrock of true friendship.\n\nIn sum, this Kural teaches us that acknowledging and appreciating the privileges that come with friendship is a sign of wisdom and an essential aspect of maintaining healthy, lasting friendships..The kural verse:பழகிய நட்பெவன் செய்யுங் கெழுதகைமைசெய்தாங்கு அமையாக் கடை. ,translates to :Of long friendship what is the use Righteous freedom if men refuse?,and it's explantion is :The Kural 803 emphasizes the essence of true friendship and the responsibilities it entails. It essentially conveys that longevity in a friendship doesn't bear significance if the friends involved do not take ownership of the actions executed through the privilege of their relationship. \n\nIn the context of this verse, it is important to understand that true friendship, according to Thiruvalluvar, is not just about the duration but more about the depth and understanding. A friendship that's long-standing should ideally nurture a bond where friends feel a sense of ownership and responsibility for the actions they perform on behalf of each other. \n\nWhen friends take actions under the rights of intimacy, they should be able to acknowledge these actions as their own. If this acknowledgment is not present, then the long-standing friendship loses its value. It implies that the true essence of friendship is lost when friends don't stand by each other and accept the actions taken on behalf of each other as their own. \n\nHence, Thiruvalluvar implies that the value of a friendship is not measured by its duration but by the depth of understanding, mutual respect and acceptance of each other's actions as their own..The kural verse:விழைதகையான் வேண்டி இருப்பர் கெழுதகையாற்கேளாது நட்டார் செயின். ,translates to :Things done unasked by loving friends Please the wise as familiar trends!,and it's explantion is :Kural 804 emphasizes the essence of true friendship and the importance of proactivity in maintaining a strong bond. The verse highlights that if a friend, through the privilege of their friendship, undertakes an action without being asked, a wise person would appreciate it due to its perceived value.\n\nThis verse underscores the virtue of understanding and intuition in a friendship. A friend who can anticipate your needs and act accordingly without being explicitly asked is highly valued. This thoughtfulness stems from a deep understanding of the other person's needs and desires, which is a cornerstone of a strong friendship.\n\nMoreover, the verse also celebrates the wisdom of those who can recognize and appreciate such proactive actions. It implies that a wise person recognizes the value of such actions, acknowledging the right of friendship that allows the friend to act without requesting and appreciating it due to its rarity and desirability.\n\nIn essence, this verse extols the virtues of proactive help and understanding in a friendship, and the wisdom required to acknowledge and appreciate such actions..The kural verse:பேதைமை ஒன்றோ பெருங்கிழமை என்றுணர்கநோதக்க நட்டார் செயின். ,translates to :Offence of friends feel it easy As folloy or close intimacy,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural highlights the dynamics of friendship and the complexities that can arise in it. The verse gently guides us to interpret the actions of our friends when they cause us pain or discomfort. It suggests that if our friends are causing us pain, it might be due to their ignorance or lack of understanding. They might not be aware of how their actions are affecting us.\n\nOn the other hand, the verse also suggests that a friend might hurt us because of the depth and intimacy of our relationship. Sometimes, a close friend might feel they have the right or privilege to act in a certain way, not realizing that their actions are causing us pain. This doesn't necessarily mean they have ill intentions, but rather they are taking the liberty that close relationships sometimes afford.\n\nThis verse thus invites us to be understanding and forgiving towards our friends, by recognizing the potential reasons behind their hurtful actions. It encourages us to communicate and educate our friends about our feelings, rather than harboring resentment or misunderstanding..The kural verse:எல்லைக்கண் நின்றார் துறவார் தொலைவிடத்தும்தொல்லைக்கண் நின்றார் தொடர்பு. ,translates to :They forsake not but continue In friendship's bounds though loss ensue,and it's explantion is :Kural 806 reflects on the depth of true friendship and the loyalty it carries, even in the face of adversity. Those who understand and abide by the boundaries of true friendship will never abandon their long-standing friends, irrespective of the challenges, difficulties, or misfortunes that may arise. This Kural emphasizes the strength of enduring friendships and the value of loyalty and commitment in such relationships.\n\nThe verse points out that genuine friends are those who stand by us, even in the toughest times, without crossing the limits of friendship. It suggests that a true friend acknowledges the essence of friendship and stays committed to it, no matter how dire the circumstances may be. This could include situations where the friend might cause harm or bring about adversities. In such instances, a true friend, understanding the confines of friendship, would not forsake the relationship.\n\nEssentially, this Kural teaches us about the importance of steadfastness in friendship and loyalty regardless of the tribulations. It underlines the profound nature of true friendship, which is not easily broken, and the virtue of standing by friends in times of adversity, reflecting the depth and resilience of such bonds..The kural verse:அழிவந்த செய்யினும் அன்பறார் அன்பின்வழிவந்த கேண்மை யவர். ,translates to :Comrades established in firm love Though ruin comes waive not their vow,and it's explantion is :Kural 807 is a tribute to the strength and resilience of love, particularly in the context of longstanding friendships. It posits that genuine affection does not wane or falter, even when faced with adversity or harm caused by the very friends one cherishes.\n\nThis verse emphasizes that those who have nurtured and maintained a relationship based on love and affection would not abandon that bond, even if their friends engage in actions that could lead to their downfall. This is because the foundation of their relationship is love, which is strong enough to withstand any challenges or obstacles.\n\nThe concept is grounded in the Indian ethos of unconditional love and friendship, which values loyalty and commitment above all else. It suggests that true friendships are not transient or conditional, but rather endure trials and tribulations, remaining steadfast even in the face of adversity.\n\nThe moral lesson here is the importance of loyalty and unconditional love in relationships. It encourages us to maintain our bonds of affection with others, regardless of their actions or circumstances. The verse teaches us that love and friendship, when genuine, can overcome even the most significant challenges, affirming the strength and resilience of human relationships..The kural verse:கேளிழுக்கம் கேளாக் கெழுதகைமை வல்லார்க்குநாளிழுக்கம் நட்டார் செயின். ,translates to :Fast friends who list not tales of ill Though wronged they say \\\"that day is well\\\",and it's explantion is :This Kural (Verse 808) emphasizes the virtue of an unwavering loyalty in friendship. Valluvar suggests that the true mark of a loyal friend is the ability to overlook and not listen to the criticisms or faults of their friends when brought up by others. This verse essentially guides us to maintain our trust and faith in our friends, even when they commit a mistake or when others point out their flaws.\n\nThe moral principle underlying this verse is the importance of loyalty and discretion in friendship. The verse suggests that it is beneficial to remain loyal and not to be swayed by rumors or gossips about our friends' faults or mistakes. This loyalty in friendship is considered a virtue, as it upholds the bond of friendship and does not allow external influences to tarnish it.\n\nThe cultural context of this verse is rooted in the Indian tradition of valuing personal relationships and loyalty. This verse reinforces the idea that a loyal friend is a valuable asset, and their worth is realized even more on the day when the friend commits a fault. The principle of loyalty, as highlighted in this verse, is universal and timeless. This verse is a lesson in loyalty, tolerance, and understanding, which are essential for maintaining lasting friendships. \n\nIn conclusion, the verse places a high value on loyalty in friendship, advising us to disregard the faults of our friends and not listen to others pointing out their mistakes. Instead, we should stand by our friends, supporting them even in their moments of weakness. This, Valluvar suggests, is the mark of a truly profitable day, and a testament to our unwavering loyalty and commitment to our friends..The kural verse:கெடாஅ வழிவந்த கேண்மையார் கேண்மைவிடாஅர் விழையும் உலகு. ,translates to :To love such friends the world desires Whose friendship has unbroken ties,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse (Kural 809) highlights the virtue of maintaining long-standing friendships, even when they might have taken a difficult turn. \n\nThe verse suggests that those who do not abandon their friends, especially those with whom they have shared a long, unbroken relationship, will be admired and respected by society.

It's a reminder that friendships are not just for good times but also for challenging times; it's about standing by your friend when they need you the most. The world respects such loyalty and steadfastness..The kural verse:விழையார் விழையப் படுப பழையார்கண்பண்பின் தலைப்பிரியா தார். ,translates to :Even foes love for better ends Those who leave not long-standing friends,and it's explantion is :Kural 810 emphasizes the virtue of unwavering loyalty to one's old friends.

This quality is so admirable that even one's enemies may come to respect and appreciate it. \n\nThe cultural context here reflects the high esteem in which loyalty and steadfastness were held in the Tamil society, where the strength of a person's character was measured by their ability to stand by their friends in good times and bad. The moral message is one of unwavering commitment to friendship, irrespective of the circumstances, which is a universal value transcending time and culture..The kural verse:பருகுவார் போலினும் பண்பிலார் கேண்மைபெருகலிற் குன்றல் இனிது. ,translates to :Swallowing love of soulless men Had better wane than wax anon,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural emphasizes the importance of having good character over superficial affection. \n\nThe verse uses a metaphor to describe people who appear to overflow with love and affection towards us, as if they would consume us with their love. However, the verse warns that if these people lack genuine goodness or virtue in their character, then their affection is not worth much. \n\nThe verse advises that it is better to lessen our connections with such individuals rather than increase them, even if they seem to overflow with love. This is because, without good character, their excessive affection may not be genuine or beneficial in the long run. The verse implies that true friendship is based on virtue and genuine goodness, not merely on outward displays of affection. \n\nSo, the moral of the Kural is that it is better to distance ourselves from those who lack good character, no matter how affectionate they appear, because a relationship without virtue is less beneficial than its absence..The kural verse:உறின்நட்டு அறினொருஉம் ஒப்பிலார் கேண்மைபெறினும் இழப்பினும் என்? ,translates to :Who fawn in wealth and fail in dearth Gain or lose; such friends have no worth,and it's explantion is :Kural 812 is a poignant expression about the nature of fair-weather friends. This verse questions the value of forming or losing associations with individuals who only show friendship when there is a potential benefit for them, and abandon you when there is nothing to gain.\n\nThe verse points out the fickle nature of such people, highlighting that their friendship is not based on mutual respect or affection, but rather on selfish motives. It essentially acts as a cautionary note, urging one to examine the motive behind the friendships they form.\n\nThe verse underscores the importance of genuine and steadfast friendships that stand the test of time and circumstances. It implies that friendships based on convenience or personal gain are not worth having or losing sleep over their loss.\n\nIt encourages individuals to value those who stick by their side through thick and thin, and not to be swayed by those who only show up when it suits them. This verse is a timeless reminder of the importance of authentic relationships in our lives..The kural verse:உறுவது சீர்தூக்கும் நட்பும் பெறுவதுகொள்வாரும் கள்வரும் நேர். ,translates to :Cunning friends who calculate  Are like thieves and whores wicked,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural criticizes those who form friendships based on personal benefits. It compares them to prostitutes who exchange intimacy for money and thieves who steal for their gain. All these three groups of individuals, according to Valluvar, are similar in that they are driven by self-interest and material gain, rather than genuine affection, trust, or ethical considerations.\n\nThe verse is a critique of opportunistic behavior and a call for genuine friendship that is not tainted by selfish motives. It also highlights the importance of integrity and sincerity in our interactions with others. It is a reminder that a friendship founded on personal gains is not a true friendship, but a transactional relationship.\n\nIn broader terms, this verse is a moral commentary on the importance of genuine relationships and ethical living. It underlines the timeless principle that our actions and relationships should be guided by principles of honesty, sincerity, and mutual respect, rather than selfish and materialistic considerations..The kural verse:அமரகத்து ஆற்றறுக்கும் கல்லாமா அன்னார்தமரின் தனிமை தலை. ,translates to :Better be alone than trust in those That throw in field like faithless horse,and it's explantion is :The verse 814 of Thiru Kural emphasizes the value of solitude over undesirable companionship. It compares untrustworthy or unreliable companions to untrained horses on the battlefield that throw their riders off and flee when danger arises. Just as such horses cause harm and danger to their riders, companions who cannot be relied upon for support and loyalty can cause emotional and sometimes, physical harm.\n\nThe verse advises that it is far better to embrace solitude rather than to keep company with such unreliable and untrustworthy individuals. It suggests that being alone can be more beneficial and peaceful, providing an opportunity for introspection, self-growth and inner peace, rather than enduring the stress and potential harm that can come from unreliable companionship.\n\nThe cultural context of this Kural is tied to the era in which it was written when warfare was common and the allegory of an untrained horse in battle vividly paints a picture of the dangers of unreliable companionship. This verse is a timeless piece of wisdom that holds true in any era, advising discernment in choosing companions and the value of solitude over bad company..The kural verse:செய்தேமஞ் சாராச் சிறியவர் புன்கேண்மைஎய்தலின் எய்தாமை நன்று. ,translates to :Friends low and mean that give no help- Leave them is better than to keep,and it's explantion is :The verse 815 of Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of discernment in choosing one's companions and avoiding those who are incapable of reciprocating loyalty or protection, even when trusted to do so.\n\nThiruvalluvar, the poet, cautions us of forming associations with individuals who are morally inferior or unreliable. He suggests that such people, regardless of their appointed roles or promises, will fail to protect or support their friends when it matters most. This failure to reciprocate loyalty or safeguard a friend's interests is seen as a sign of baseness or moral weakness.\n\nThe verse promotes the wisdom of refraining from entering into a relationship with such individuals. It tells us that it is far better to avoid such toxic companionship than to engage in it only to be disappointed later.\n\nThe moral implication of this verse is the importance of discretion in relationships. It encourages us to be mindful of who we let into our lives, reminding us that not all who offer friendship do so with genuine intentions or the capability to honor that bond. It urges us to value quality over quantity in our relationships, to seek companions who are not only dependable but also morally sound. \n\nThis is a timeless piece of advice that resonates across cultures and epochs, for the company we keep can significantly influence our character, actions, and overall life trajectory..The kural verse:பேதை பெருங்கெழீஇ நட்பின் அறிவுடையார்ஏதின்மை கோடி உறும். ,translates to :Million times the wise man's hate Is better than a fool intimate,and it's explantion is :Kural 816 emphasizes the value of wisdom and intelligence in relationships, stating that the enmity or disapproval of a wise person is far more beneficial than the close friendship of a fool. This is because a wise person's criticism or disapproval often comes from a place of understanding, insight, and genuine concern, which can lead to improvement and growth. On the other hand, a fool's excessive intimacy or friendship might be based on ignorance or lack of understanding, leading to stagnation or even harm. Hence, the Kural suggests that it is better to earn the dislike of a wise person, as it can lead to self-improvement, than to be in the good books of a fool whose friendship might not offer any constructive value. This verse underscores the importance of associating with wise and knowledgeable people for personal growth and development, and cautions against the potential pitfalls of forming close bonds with those who lack wisdom and understanding..The kural verse:நகைவகைய ராகிய நட்பின் பகைவரால்பத்தடுத்த கோடி உறும். ,translates to :Ten-fold crore you gain from foes Than from friends who are vain laughers,and it's explantion is :Kural 817 talks about the value of genuine and purposeful relationships over superficial ones. It suggests that the adversities caused by enemies can be more beneficial than the companionship of those who only bring laughter and entertainment, but lack sincerity and depth.\n\nThe line \"What comes from enemies is a hundred million times more profitable than what comes from the friendship of those who cause only laughter\" implies that even the challenges posed by adversaries can lead to growth and improvement, as they force us to confront our weaknesses and mistakes. On the contrary, being around those who only induce laughter and pleasure may hinder our personal development as they often distract us from reflecting on our shortcomings and working towards self-improvement.\n\nThe verse advises us to value friendships that push us to better ourselves, even if they come with difficulties and challenges, rather than investing in relationships that only offer superficial enjoyment and temporary satisfaction. It underlines the idea that true growth and wisdom often come from overcoming challenges and adversities, rather than from mindless amusement and pleasure..The kural verse:ஒல்லும் கருமம் உடற்று பவர்கேண்மைசொல்லாடார் சோர விடல். ,translates to :Without a word those friends eschew Who spoil deeds which they can do,and it's explantion is :Kural 818 encourages the gradual withdrawal from friendships or associations with people who feign inability to do what they can actually accomplish. \n\nThe verse stresses the importance of integrity and sincerity in relationships. It warns against people who pretend to be incapable of performing certain tasks when in reality, they are fully capable of doing so. Such people may do this out of laziness, deceit, or to avoid responsibility. \n\nThe Kural advises to slowly disengage from these individuals without making it obvious. This gradual disconnection allows one to avoid potential conflict or harm that might arise from an abrupt end to the relationship. \n\nThis verse teaches us the value of honesty in relationships and the need to disassociate from those lacking this virtue. This is because dishonesty, in the long run, can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and disharmony. Hence, it's advised to distance oneself from such individuals, ensuring personal growth and peace. \n\nIn essence, Thirukkural 818 advocates for sincerity in relationships and warns against the negative impact of deceit and dishonesty..The kural verse:கனவினும் இன்னாது மன்னோ வினைவேறுசொல்வேறு பட்டார் தொடர்பு. ,translates to :Even in dreams the tie is bad With those whose deed is far from word,and it's explantion is :Kural 819 emphasizes the importance of congruence between words and actions in any relationship, especially friendship. The verse warns that befriending those who don't align their actions with their words can lead to distress and discomfort, even in one's dreams. This is because such individuals are often unreliable and untrustworthy, causing unpredictability and unease in the relationship. \n\nThe verse underscores the value of sincerity and honesty in friendships. It implies that true friends are those who not only say what they mean but also follow through with their promises through their actions. Such friendships are harmonious and peaceful, devoid of any distressing surprises. Conversely, friendships with those whose words and deeds are inconsistent can lead to confusion, disappointment, and distress, even invading one's dreams with worry.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse serves as a reminder to assess the sincerity and reliability of individuals before forming close relationships with them. It also encourages individuals to strive for consistency in their own words and deeds, to foster trust and harmony within their relationships..The kural verse:எனைத்தும் குறுகுதல் ஓம்பல் மனைக்கெழீஇமன்றில் பழிப்பார் தொடர்பு. ,translates to :Keep aloof from those that smile At home and in public revile,and it's explantion is :Kural 820 is a sage advice about the type of friends one should avoid. The couplet warns against the people who are affectionate towards you in private, but critique or ridicule you in public. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining distance from such individuals, no matter how small or insignificant their friendship might seem.\n\nThe verse indicates that genuine friendship is consistent in both public and private life. It's a bond that doesn't change with the setting or audience. People who change their behavior based on the context are not dependable, and their friendship is not trustworthy. Their public ridicule can harm your reputation, and their private affection can mislead you into a false sense of security.\n\nThus, Thiruvalluvar advises us to be cautious of such inconsistent people. Avoiding them, even at the cost of losing a seemingly minor friendship, is better than enduring the potential harm they could cause. This Kural emphasizes the need for consistency, integrity, and mutual respect in any relationship, especially friendship..The kural verse:சீரிடம் காணின் எறிதற்குப் பட்டடைநேரா நிரந்தவர் நட்பு. ,translates to :The friendship by an enemy shown Is anvil in time, to strike you down,and it's explantion is :Kural 821 emphasizes the potential dangers of insincere friendships. It compares the friendship of those who pretend to be friendly on the surface, but carry no real affection in their hearts, to a weapon that is likely to strike when the opportunity arises.\n\nIn this verse, Valluvar uses the metaphor of a double-edged sword. Just like a sword, such friendships can act as a support at times, but they can also turn dangerous when the circumstances change. These insincere friends may seem helpful and supportive on the outside, but they are likely to harm you when a favorable opportunity presents itself. \n\nThis Kural serves as a cautionary reminder to be mindful of the sincerity and authenticity of one's friendships. It advises us to discern between fair-weather friends and true friends who are genuinely invested in our well-being. A true friend is not measured by their demeanor in times of comfort and convenience, but by their actions in times of adversity and challenge. \n\nTherefore, this verse underlines the importance of evaluating the quality of friendships and the potential harm that can come from those who feign friendship without genuine affection. It reminds us to be vigilant about who we trust and to maintain a safe distance from those whose intentions are not sincere..The kural verse:இனம்போன்று இனமல்லார் கேண்மை மகளிர்மனம்போல வேறு படும். ,translates to :Who pretend kinship but are not Their friendship's fickle like woman's heart,and it's explantion is :Kural 822 discusses the fickle nature of false friendships and equates it to the unpredictable emotions of women.\n\nThe verse states, \"The friendship of those who appear to be friends while they are not, will fluctuate like the love of women.\" This verse is essentially a commentary on the superficiality and inconsistency of certain relationships. The poet likens the friendship of those who pretend to be friends but are not, to the love of women, which he implies can be changeable and unpredictable.\n\nThe comparison here could be seen as a critique of both false friendships and the stereotypical perception of a woman's emotions as volatile. However, it's important to note that the poet is not devalifying women but using a common cultural metaphor to illustrate his point about the insincerity of certain friendships.\n\nThe message in this verse is a cautionary one, reminding us to discern the genuineness of our relationships and be wary of those whose actions may not match their words. It encourages us to seek depth and sincerity in our friendships, rather than being swayed by appearances..The kural verse:பலநல்ல கற்றக் கடைத்து மனநல்லர்ஆகுதல் மாணார்க் கரிது. ,translates to :They may be vast in good studies But heartfelt-love is hard for foes,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse 823 emphasizes that mere acquisition of knowledge from numerous good books or scriptures does not necessarily lead to a kind and loving heart, especially in the case of one's enemies. Despite their intellectual accomplishments, if they harbor enmity in their hearts, it becomes nearly impossible for them to cultivate a truly loving disposition. \n\nThe verse highlights the importance of inner transformation and the cultivation of virtues such as love, kindness, and compassion. It suggests that knowledge, in itself, is not adequate to effectuate this transformation. It requires the practice and application of the principles learned, to cleanse the heart of negative emotions like hatred and animosity. \n\nIn essence, it underscores the fact that knowledge and wisdom are two distinct entities. While knowledge can be gained from books, wisdom is attained through introspection, self-improvement, and the practice of virtues in one's life. The verse warns against the mistake of equating intellectual prowess with moral integrity, reminding us that true wisdom lies in the purity of one's heart and not just in the depth of one's knowledge..The kural verse:முகத்தின் இனிய நகாஅ அகத்தின்னாவஞ்சரை அஞ்சப் படும். ,translates to :Fear foes whose face has winning smiles Whose heart is full of cunning guiles,and it's explantion is :Kural 824 warns about the deceptive nature of certain individuals who may seem amiable and congenial on the surface, but harbor ill-intent within their hearts. They present a pleasant demeanor, often smiling and acting friendly, but their intentions are not genuine. Their external sweetness is a facade to mask their internal deceit.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the need to be wary of such individuals. It suggests that one should fear or be cautious of these deceitful people, who smile sweetly with their face, but harbor no love or goodwill in their hearts. The verse highlights the fact that not all who appear friendly are indeed friends - some may have hidden agendas and may be plotting harm.\n\nIn essence, this Kural teaches us the importance of discernment in our interactions with others. It encourages us to look beyond superficial appearances and to be cautious in our dealings with those whose intentions may not be as pure as their outward demeanor suggests. It is a reminder of the potential harm that can come from misplaced trust and the importance of vigilance in our relationships..The kural verse:மனத்தின் அமையா தவரை எனைத்தொன்றும்சொல்லினால் தேறற்பாற்று அன்று. ,translates to :Do not trust in what they tell Whose mind with your mind goes ill,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of sincerity and authenticity in relationships and interactions. It advises that one should not trust or rely on the words of those whose actions do not align with their hearts, i.e., those who do not express genuine love or affection. \n\nThe verse suggests that if someone's actions do not match their words, or if their heart is not truly invested in their words, it is not wise to trust them or depend on their assurances. According to the verse, such individuals may not be reliable or trustworthy, as their words may not reflect their true intentions or feelings.\n\nThe verse further implies that trust should be built on sincerity and authenticity. It cautions us to be aware of those who might speak convincingly but lack sincerity in their hearts. It reminds us to be discerning in our relationships and to place our trust wisely.\n\nIn a broader sense, the verse can also be interpreted as a call for honesty and integrity in all aspects of life. It advocates for the congruence of thoughts, words, and actions as a mark of a truly virtuous person..The kural verse:நட்டார்போல் நல்லவை சொல்லினும் ஒட்டார்சொல்ஒல்லை உணரப் படும். ,translates to :The words of foes is quickly seen Though they speak like friends in fine,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the discerning ability to understand the true intentions behind seemingly sweet words, particularly when they come from adversaries. \n\nThe verse suggests that even when one's enemies speak kindly, appearing to be friends, their underlying harmful intentions can be quickly understood. This understanding comes from the perception that the words of an enemy, even if they seem pleasant, are likely to contain a hidden malicious intent.\n\nThe verse highlights the importance of discerning wisdom in human interactions. It underscores the need to be cautious and perceptive, especially in dealing with those who have previously shown enmity. This wisdom allows one to see through the veneer of friendly words spoken by foes, revealing their true malevolent intentions.\n\nSo, the moral lesson here is to be discerning and vigilant, not to be deceived by the outwardly pleasant words of those who bear ill-will, because their harmful intentions will eventually become clear..The kural verse:சொல்வணக்கம் ஒன்னார்கண் கொள்ளற்க வில்வணக்கம்தீங்கு குறித்தமை யான். ,translates to :Trust not the humble words of foes Danger darts from bending bows,and it's explantion is :Kural 827 highlights the deceptive nature of flattering words from enemies. It draws an analogy between the bending of a bow and flattering remarks from foes. Just as a bent bow is an indication of impending harm, flattering words from enemies often hide malicious intentions. Therefore, the Kural advises not to trust or accept such words, no matter how pleasing they might sound. The verse thus emphasizes the importance of discernment and caution when dealing with adversaries. It further suggests that it's wise to consider the source of the words, their potential implications and the underlying motives, rather than being swayed by mere rhetoric..The kural verse:தொழுதகை யுள்ளும் படையொடுங்கும் ஒன்னார்அழுதகண் ணீரும் அனைத்து. ,translates to :Adoring hands of foes hide arms Their sobbing tears have lurking harms,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural warns about the deceitful nature of enemies. The verse uses the metaphor of a hidden weapon in the hands of foes to symbolize their treacherous intentions, even when they seemingly show respect or affection. This means that, even when enemies appear to be respectful or adoring, they may harbor harmful intentions, symbolized by the hidden weapon. \n\nThe verse also mentions the tears shed by the enemies, implying that their emotional expressions may also be part of their deception. Just like the hidden weapon, their tears are also part of their cunning strategy. Hence, one should not be swayed by the apparent show of emotions from enemies, as it could be a pretense to mask their true, harmful intentions. \n\nThe verse highlights the importance of vigilance and discernment in dealing with people who have proven themselves to be untrustworthy. It serves as a reminder to not be deceived by outward appearances and to always be cautious of the potential harm that enemies can cause..The kural verse:மிகச்செய்து தம்மெள்ளு வாரை நகச்செய்துநட்பினுள் சாப்புல்லற் பாற்று. ,translates to :In open who praise, at heart despise Cajole and crush them in friendly guise,and it's explantion is :Kural 829 is a reflection on political acumen and diplomacy. It suggests that a ruler or leader should outwardly display great affection and friendship towards those who, despite appearing friendly, harbour ill-will or contempt towards them. However, inwardly, the ruler should be aware of this deceit and work to neutralize any potential harm from such individuals. \n\nThis verse is essentially about the strategy of dealing with hidden enemies who masquerade as friends. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining a facade of friendship to keep the enemy at ease, while internally being aware and prepared for their deceit. \n\nThe broader moral lesson here is about discernment and wisdom in relationships, especially in situations of power and leadership. It is a call to be vigilant and wise, to see beyond outward appearances, and to protect oneself from hidden harm. \n\nIn the context of everyday life, this verse can be interpreted as a reminder to exercise discernment in our relationships, to be aware of the potential for deceit, and to handle such situations with grace and wisdom..The kural verse:பகைநட்பாம் காலம் வருங்கால் முகநட்டுஅகநட்பு ஒரீஇ விடல். ,translates to :When foes, in time, play friendship's part Feign love on face but not in heart,and it's explantion is :Kural 830 provides wisdom on dealing with foes who suddenly start to behave as friends. It suggests that one should always remain cautious and discerning in such situations. \n\nThe verse advises that if an enemy appears to turn into a friend, one should reciprocate their friendly gestures on the surface, but keep their heart devoid of any affection towards them. This does not mean to harbor ill-will or resentment, rather it's a reminder to be mindful and not let the guard down completely, considering their past animosity. \n\nThe underlying message here is about prudence and discretion in relationships, especially when dealing with those who have shown hostility in the past. It cautions that appearances can be deceptive and we should not let momentary friendliness overshadow the history of enmity. \n\nOnce the time of feigned friendship passes, the verse advises to let go of even the superficial friendship that was maintained. This is not promoting unfriendliness, but a reminder to maintain a safe emotional distance from those who have proven to be unreliable or harmful in the past, thereby protecting oneself from potential harm or betrayal. \n\nIn essence, this Kural advises discernment, caution, and emotional intelligence in handling complex interpersonal relationships..The kural verse:பேதைமை என்பதொன்று யாதெனின் ஏதங்கொண்டுஊதியம் போக விடல். ,translates to :This is folly's prominent vein To favour loss and forego gain,and it's explantion is :Kural 831 addresses the concept of folly, identifying it as one of the prominent defects in human character. The verse emphasizes that folly is the state of being unable to differentiate between what is beneficial and what is harmful. As a result, individuals tend to embrace detrimental actions, behaviors, or decisions, while disregarding or letting go of the opportunities or actions that could bring them gain or advantage.\n\nIn essence, this verse warns us about the dangers of ignorance and ill-judgment. It suggests that when we lack understanding or discernment, we may end up causing harm to ourselves by accepting what is unprofitable and neglecting what is beneficial. This reckless approach can lead to significant losses, both tangible and intangible.\n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse encourages us to cultivate wisdom and sound judgment to differentiate good from bad, right from wrong, and beneficial from harmful. It underscores the importance of intellectual growth and encourages the pursuit of knowledge and understanding as a means to avoid the pitfalls of folly..The kural verse:பேதைமையுள் எல்லாம் பேதைமை காதன்மைகையல்ல தன்கட் செயல். ,translates to :Folly of follies is to lead A lewd and lawless life so bad,and it's explantion is :Kural 832 talks about the height of folly or ignorance. It denotes the act of taking pleasure in undertaking tasks or actions that are deemed inappropriate or forbidden. The verse suggests that engaging in activities beyond one's capabilities or actions that are against one's moral code, is the highest form of foolishness. \n\nThe crux of the verse is to underline the importance of understanding one's limitations and adhering to ethical and moral boundaries. Ignorance is not just about the lack of knowledge but also about the conscious decision to indulge in actions that are clearly incorrect or harmful. Among all forms of ignorance, the worst one is to pursue actions that one knows are wrong and harmful, and yet deriving pleasure from them. \n\nIn a broader cultural context, this kural encourages us to exercise wisdom and prudence in our actions. It warns us about the dangers of unbridled desire that may lead one to act against their better judgment. It is a reminder to stay true to our moral compass and not to let our desires dictate our actions, especially when those actions can have harmful consequences..The kural verse:நாணாமை நாடாமை நாரின்மை யாதொன்றும்பேணாமை பேதை தொழில் ,translates to :Shameless, aimless, callous, listless Such are the marks of foolishness,and it's explantion is :Kural 833 talks about the characteristics of a fool. The verse suggests that a fool is defined by four key traits: shamelessness, indifference, harshness, and aversion to desirable things. \n\nThe first trait, shamelessness, refers to a lack of embarrassment or remorse when engaging in inappropriate or immoral behavior. This is often due to a lack of understanding of social norms or moral values.\n\nIndifference, the second trait, refers to the lack of interest or concern in matters that are important or should be sought after. This could mean neglecting one's duties, ignoring the needs of others, or failing to seek knowledge and wisdom.\n\nThe third trait, harshness, suggests a lack of kindness or compassion towards others. It indicates a disregard for the feelings and welfare of others, often resulting in causing harm or distress to others.\n\nThe final trait, aversion to everything desirable, implies the rejection or avoidance of things that are generally considered good or beneficial. This could include virtues like honesty, integrity, kindness, or even tangible things like wealth or success.\n\nThese traits, according to Thiruvalluvar, are the characteristics of a fool. He implies that such behavior leads to a life devoid of respect, happiness, and success. This verse is an advice to avoid these negative traits and aspire to cultivate opposite virtues like shame in doing wrong, interest in fruitful pursuits, kindness towards all, and desire for good things in life..The kural verse:ஓதி உணர்ந்தும் பிறர்க்குரைத்தும் தானடங்காப்பேதையின் பேதையார் இல். ,translates to :No fool equals the fool who learns Knows, teaches, but self-control spurns,and it's explantion is :Kural 834 is a reflection on the application of knowledge and wisdom in one's life. It emphasizes that the true value of learning and understanding is not just in acquiring knowledge or in its dissemination to others, but in living according to that understanding.\n\nThe verse suggests that even if a person has read extensively, comprehended deeply, and shared that knowledge with others, they are deemed foolish if they do not adhere to their own teachings in their personal life. This could be seen as a commentary on the hypocrisy of preaching principles or virtues that one does not follow oneself. The verse thus underlines the importance of personal integrity and consistency between one's words and actions.\n\nIn essence, this Kural is a reminder that knowledge and wisdom are not just intellectual exercises, but essentially guides for living a principled and meaningful life. It suggests that the highest form of wisdom is to practice what you preach. Otherwise, such unpracticed knowledge is fruitless and the person holding it is no different from a fool. \n\nIn a broader cultural context, this verse underscores the strong emphasis on moral and ethical living in the Tamil tradition, highlighting the belief that true wisdom is as much about right action as it is about right understanding..The kural verse:ஒருமைச் செயலாற்றும் பேதை எழுமையும்தான்புக் கழுந்தும் அளறு. ,translates to :The fool suffers seven fold hells In single birth of hellish ills,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural, a classic Tamil text, warns about the consequences of foolishness and ignorance. The verse suggests that a fool, through his unwise actions in a single life, can create a hell for himself that will cause him suffering in seven subsequent lives. This is a metaphorical way of stating that the consequences of one's actions can be long-lasting and severe.\n\nThe concept here is based on the belief in reincarnation and karma prevalent in Indian philosophy. The \"seven births\" mentioned in the verse should not be taken literally but rather symbolically to denote a long period of time or even eternity. \n\nThe verse advises us to be wise and thoughtful in our actions, as our deeds can have repercussions that extend far beyond our present life. It underscores the importance of wisdom, prudence, and ethical conduct, and warns against the perils of foolishness and ignorance. The verse is a stark reminder that we are accountable for our actions, and that every action we take has consequences that we must bear, possibly even in future lives..The kural verse:பொய்படும் ஒன்றோ புனைபூணும் கையறியாப்பேதை வினைமேற் கொளின். ,translates to :A know-nothing fool daring a deed Not only fails but feels fettered,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural delivers a strong cautionary message about the dangers of undertaking a task without the proper knowledge or understanding. It emphasizes that ignorance and incompetence can not only lead to failure, but can also result in dire consequences for the individual, symbolized here as fetters or chains.\n\nThe verse speaks of a 'fool' - a person who lacks the necessary wisdom or knowledge to perform a task appropriately. When such a person undertakes a task, they are bound to fail because they do not know the right way to go about it. However, the consequences do not stop at failure. The verse warns that the fool's ignorance may lead him to greater troubles, represented metaphorically as 'adorning himself with fetters'. This could mean that his actions could lead to punishment, shame, or further complications.\n\nThe verse is a reminder of the importance of knowledge, understanding, and skill in any endeavor. It encourages individuals to acquire these qualities before embarking on any task, to avoid failure and negative consequences. It also highlights the potential downside of overconfidence and reckless action without proper understanding. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can be seen as advocating for a thoughtful and informed approach to life, where actions are guided by knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, rather than ignorance and haste. It promotes a culture of learning and preparation, underlining the risks of ignorance and the value of knowledge..The kural verse:ஏதிலார் ஆரத் தமர்பசிப்பர் பேதைபெருஞ்செல்வம் உற்றக் கடை. ,translates to :Strangers feast and kinsmen fast  When fools mishandle fortunes vast,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the consequences of wealth in the hands of a fool. When a foolish person comes into great wealth, they are likely to misuse or squander it, often to the benefit of those who do not have their best interests at heart (here referred to as neighbours). Meanwhile, their true relations, or those who genuinely care about them, are left in want or even starvation. \n\nThe verse is a commentary on the importance of wisdom and discernment in handling wealth. It suggests that without intelligence and understanding, wealth can be more of a curse than a blessing, causing harm and distress to those who should ideally benefit from it.\n\nThe moral perspective is that wealth should be managed with wisdom and consideration for those who are genuinely associated with us. It warns against the reckless use of wealth, which can lead to exploitation by others and deprivation for those who are deserving. It underlines the necessity of wisdom, caution, and responsibility in financial matters..The kural verse:மையல் ஒருவன் களித்தற்றால் பேதைதன்கையொன்று உடைமை பெறின். ,translates to :Fools possessing something on hand Like dazed and drunken stupids stand,and it's explantion is :The Kural 838 is a profound commentary on the dangers of wealth or any valuable possession falling into the hands of those who lack wisdom or discretion. Here, Thiruvalluvar uses the analogy of a man who is already giddy or lightheaded from intoxication, getting further inebriated.\n\nThe verse suggests that if a fool, someone who lacks discernment between right and wrong, good and bad, happens to possess something valuable, it would result in a situation akin to a person already suffering from dizziness, getting further drunk. The implication is that the fool, like the intoxicated person, will misuse the possession, possibly causing harm to himself and others. The possession amplifies the inherent folly of the individual, leading to chaotic and potentially destructive outcomes.\n\nThe verse is a cautionary note about the importance of wisdom and discretion in handling wealth or any valuable possession. It emphasizes the idea that possession in the hands of the unwise is not a blessing but a potential source of disaster. It underscores the need for wisdom and judicious judgment in the possession and use of wealth or resources..The kural verse:பெரிதினிது பேதையார் கேண்மை பிரிவின்கண்பீழை தருவதொன் றில். ,translates to :Friendship with fools is highly sweet For without a groan we part,and it's explantion is :Kural 839 emphasizes the nature of friendship between individuals who lack wisdom or discernment (referred to as \"fools\" in the verse). The verse states that such friendships are highly pleasing because there is no pain or distress when such relationships come to an end.\n\nIn other words, the verse suggests that when friendships are formed between individuals who lack understanding or wisdom, these relationships may seem incredibly enjoyable and carefree. This is primarily because these individuals do not fully grasp the depth and significance of the bond, and therefore, they do not experience the emotional pain or sorrow that typically accompanies the dissolution of a meaningful friendship.\n\nFurthermore, this verse also subtly implies the importance of wisdom in forming deep, meaningful relationships. Without wisdom, relationships can be superficial and temporary, ending without causing any emotional turmoil or distress, thereby reflecting their lack of depth and significance.\n\nOverall, Thiruvalluvar, through this verse, encourages the cultivation of wisdom to form meaningful friendships that enrich our lives rather than engaging in superficial relationships that end without any emotional impact..The kural verse:கழாஅக்கால் பள்ளியுள் வைத்தற்றால் சான்றோர்குழாஅத்துப் பேதை புகல். ,translates to :Entrance of fools where Savants meet Looks like couch trod by unclean feet,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the inappropriateness of a fool's presence in a gathering of learned people. The metaphor used here is that of one placing unwashed feet on a clean bed - an act considered disrespectful and unclean in many cultures. Similarly, when a person lacking wisdom or knowledge intrudes into a group of erudite individuals, their lack of intellect becomes glaringly apparent and disrupts the harmony and intellectual depth of the discourse. It is not just embarrassing for the person in question, but it also compromises the quality of the discussion, just as dirty feet would soil a clean bed. Additionally, this verse underscores the importance of knowing one's place and acting according to one's intellectual capabilities and social appropriateness..The kural verse:அறிவின்மை இன்மையுள் இன்மை பிறிதின்மைஇன்மையா வையா துலகு. ,translates to :Want of wisdom is want of wants Want of aught else the world nev'r counts,and it's explantion is :Kural 841 emphasizes the supremacy of wisdom over all forms of wealth. It suggests that the lack of wisdom or knowledge is the most significant deficiency one can suffer from. The verse asserts that the world, or society at large, may not perceive the lack of material wealth as a significant deficiency, but the lack of wisdom is indeed the most significant.\n\nIn the broader context, this verse touches on the ancient and universal wisdom that knowledge is the most valuable asset one can possess. Material wealth may come and go, but wisdom, once acquired, is a lifelong asset that continually adds value to one's life and to the lives of others. In this regard, the verse is a powerful reminder of the importance of education, learning, and the pursuit of knowledge over mere material gain.\n\nFurthermore, the verse also suggests a critique of societal values, indicating that the world may not fully recognize or appreciate the value of wisdom compared to material wealth. This reflects on the human tendency to prioritize immediate, tangible gains over long-term, intangible assets such as knowledge and wisdom.\n\nIn summary, Kural 841 underscores the importance of wisdom and knowledge and critiques society's undue emphasis on material wealth. It promotes the pursuit of knowledge as the ultimate goal and the most valuable asset in life..The kural verse:அறிவிலான் நெஞ்சுவந்து ஈதல் பிறிதியாதும்இல்லை பெறுவான் தவம். ,translates to :When fool bestows with glee a gift It comes but by getter's merit,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the concept of karma or the law of cause and effect, which is deeply ingrained in Indian philosophical thoughts. According to this verse, when a person lacking in wisdom gives something cheerfully, the cause isn't his own generosity or benevolence, but the merit of the receiver from their past life. \n\nThe verse suggests that the past good deeds of the recipient are what compel the otherwise ignorant person to give willingly. It reinforces the belief that good deeds or 'punya' earned in one's past life are carried forward to the next life, influencing one's fortunes and experiences. \n\nThis interpretation encourages moral behavior, urging people to do good deeds in the present, so they may reap their benefits in the future. It also serves as a reminder that our actions, both good and bad, have consequences that may extend beyond our current lifetime..The kural verse:அறிவிலார் தாந்தம்மைப் பீழிக்கும் பீழைசெறுவார்க்கும் செய்தல் அரிது. ,translates to :The self-torments of fools exceed Ev'n tortures of their foes indeed,and it's explantion is :Kural 843 emphasizes the detrimental effects of a lack of wisdom or understanding. The verse suggests that those who are devoid of wisdom often inflict suffering upon themselves to an extent that even their worst enemies could not. This self-inflicted suffering is often a result of their ignorance, poor decisions, and inability to perceive the consequences of their actions.\n\nIn simpler terms, the verse implores individuals to strive for wisdom and understanding, as a lack thereof can lead to self-destruction that surpasses any harm an enemy can inflict. The wisdom here can be interpreted as not only knowledge but also the ability to make right decisions, the ability to foresee consequences, and the capacity to learn from one's mistakes.\n\nThis Kural highlights the importance of personal growth, wisdom, and self-awareness in life, indicating that without these, a person can become their own worst enemy. It is a call for introspection and self-improvement..The kural verse:வெண்மை எனப்படுவ தியாதெனின் ஒண்மைஉடையம்யாம் என்னும் செருக்கு. ,translates to :Stupidity is vanity That cries \\\"We have sagacity\\\",and it's explantion is :Kural 844 speaks about the deceptive nature of self-proclaimed wisdom. It points out that the act of declaring oneself as wise, in fact, signifies the lack of wisdom. This is because true wisdom lies in understanding and acknowledging one's limitations and the vastness of knowledge that still remains unexplored.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that genuine wisdom is marked by humility and the recognition that there is always more to learn. When one starts to believe that they are the epitome of wisdom, it is a clear sign of their ignorance and vanity. It is a stark reminder that knowledge and wisdom are never-ending pursuits and the moment one believes they have attained it all, it is a reflection of their lack of wisdom.\n\nMoreover, this Kural highlights a key moral lesson - that self-realization and modesty form the crux of wisdom. It warns against the pitfalls of arrogance and self-delusion that often accompany knowledge. The essence of this verse is to encourage continuous learning, humility, and self-awareness..The kural verse:கல்லாத மேற்கொண் டொழுகல் கசடறவல்லதூஉம் ஐயம் தரும். ,translates to :Feigning knowledge that one has not Leads to doubt ev'n that he has got,and it's explantion is :Kural 845 emphasizes the importance of authenticity and the negative impact of pretension. It suggests that if a person pretends to have knowledge about things they have not studied or understood, it will create doubt in others' minds about the areas in which they actually have expertise. \n\nThe verse highlights the potential harm that comes from faking knowledge. When a person pretends to understand something they don't, it not only discredits their genuine abilities, but also raises suspicion about their overall credibility.\n\nThis kural warns against the act of deception and encourages the pursuit of genuine knowledge and honesty. It reminds us that it's better to admit ignorance than to feign knowledge, since the latter can lead to mistrust and damage one's reputation. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, through this verse, advises us to be sincere in our pursuit of knowledge, to be honest about our understanding, and not to pretend to know things that we do not..The kural verse:அற்றம் மறைத்தலோ புல்லறிவு தம்வயின்குற்றம் மறையா வழி. ,translates to :Fools their nakedness conceal And yet their glaring faults reveal,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of acknowledging and rectifying one's own flaws rather than hiding them. Saint Thiruvalluvar, the author, uses the metaphor of clothing and nakedness to convey this message.\n\nThe verse suggests that it is foolish to cover one's physical nakedness with clothing, while leaving one's moral and ethical flaws exposed. The physical act of covering oneself with clothing is a basic human instinct, driven by the need for decency and societal norms. However, Thiruvalluvar argues that the same effort, if not more, should be applied to addressing one's flaws and shortcomings.\n\nThis verse is a call to self-introspection and self-improvement. It urges individuals to be aware of their own faults and to actively work towards correcting them. Just as one would not want to expose their physical nakedness to the world, they should also strive to not expose their moral and ethical 'nakedness' or faults.\n\nIn essence, the verse implies that covering one's physical self without addressing one's moral and ethical imperfections is an act of ignorance and folly. It stresses the importance of personal growth, integrity, and moral rectitude over superficial appearances..The kural verse:அருமறை சோரும் அறிவிலான் செய்யும்பெருமிறை தானே தனக்கு. ,translates to :The fool that slights sacred counsels Upon himself great harm entails,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse emphasizes the importance of wisdom and the consequences of ignoring wise counsel. The verse suggests that someone who disregards valuable advice and wisdom is essentially doing harm to themselves. The 'great injury' mentioned in the verse refers to the potential mistakes, missteps, and the resulting suffering that one might experience as a result of ignoring wisdom.\n\nThe 'precious counsel' here alludes to the teachings of the wise, moral principles, ethical guidelines, or even practical advice that can guide one's actions and decisions in life. It emphasizes the importance of learning, understanding, and following these principles to lead a successful and fulfilling life.\n\nThe verse highlights the fact that wisdom and knowledge are not just intellectual exercises, but they have a direct impact on our lives. It underscores the consequences of ignorance and the importance of self-awareness, suggesting that one's actions and decisions, if made without proper understanding or consideration, can lead to self-inflicted suffering.\n\nIn a broader sense, the verse also underscores the importance of education and learning, suggesting that ignorance is not bliss, but a source of potential harm. It encourages individuals to seek knowledge, learn from others, and use that knowledge to make informed decisions in life..The kural verse:ஏவவும் செய்கலான் தான்தேறான் அவ்வுயிர்போஒம் அளவுமோர் நோய். ,translates to :He listens not nor himself knows Plague is his life until it goes,and it's explantion is :Thiru Kural 848 conveys the message about the harmful consequences of ignorance and the refusal to learn from others. It emphasizes the detrimental effect of not willing to perform the duties suggested by others, as well as not being able to understand them on one's own. \n\nThe first line \"ஏவவும் செய்கலான் தான்தேறான்\" literally translates to \"the one who doesn't perform even when advised, nor learns on his own\". This refers to a person who is not only unresponsive to advice or guidance from others but also lacks the initiative or ability to understand their responsibilities by themselves. Such a person is oblivious to their duties and does not make an effort to learn or improve.\n\nThe second line \"அவ்வுயிர் போஒம் அளவுமோர் நோய்\" translates to \"such a soul is a perpetual disease till its end\". Here, Thiruvalluvar likens the person's life to a relentless disease, implying that their ignorance and refusal to learn is a chronic ailment, persisting till the end of their life.\n\nIn essence, this Kural warns about the destructive consequences of ignorance and the refusal to learn or perform duties. It advocates for the importance of learning, self-improvement, and fulfilling responsibilities in living a meaningful and productive life. The persistent ignorance is seen as a chronic disease, hindering the growth and progress of the individual, thus leading to a wasted life. The verse serves as a reminder to always be open to advice, to be proactive in learning and to fulfill one's responsibilities diligently..The kural verse:காணாதான் காட்டுவான் தான்காணான் காணாதான்கண்டானாம் தான்கண்ட வாறு. ,translates to :Sans Self-sight in vain one opens Sight To the blind who bet their sight as right,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural, Kural 849, conveys the futility of trying to impart wisdom to someone who lacks the basic ability to comprehend or appreciate it. It suggests that the effort to educate a fool only reveals the folly of the educator, as the fool remains oblivious and continues to regard himself as wise based on his limited knowledge.\n\nThe verse metaphorically highlights the inherent challenge in trying to enlighten someone who is not ready or willing to learn. It underscores the idea that real wisdom lies not just in acquiring knowledge, but also in the ability to understand, accept, and apply it. \n\nFrom a societal perspective, this Kural subtly reminds us of the importance of self-awareness and humility in the pursuit of knowledge. It suggests that one must be open to learning and self-improvement, as the belief of knowing everything can hinder personal growth and wisdom.\n\nIn essence, Thiru Kural 849 is a timeless reflection on wisdom, learning, and the perils of ignorance and arrogance. It serves as a cautionary note on the importance of being humble and receptive in our quest for knowledge and wisdom..The kural verse:உலகத்தார் உண்டென்பது இல்லென்பான் வையத்துஅலகையா வைக்கப் படும். ,translates to :To people's \\\"Yes\\\" who proffer \\\"No\\\" Deemed as ghouls on earth they go,and it's explantion is :Kural 850 highlights the importance of respecting and acknowledging the beliefs and truths that are widely accepted by the world. The verse suggests that an individual who outright denies or dismisses these commonly held beliefs would be seen as an outcast or a 'demon' in society.\n\nThis Kural doesn't necessarily mean that one must accept everything that the world believes in without question. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of respect and understanding for the beliefs of others. The term 'demon' here is used metaphorically to refer to someone who is socially ostracized or isolated due to their denial of universally accepted truths or beliefs. \n\nThis verse is a stark reminder of the significance of empathy, respect, and understanding in a diverse society. It nudges us towards being open-minded, respectful of different beliefs, and observant towards the world's commonly accepted truths. Even if we choose not to believe in certain things, it is essential to acknowledge that these beliefs hold value and truth for others. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, through this verse, encourages intellectual humility, respect for diversity, and the importance of empathy in societal interactions..The kural verse:இகலென்ப எல்லா உயிர்க்கும் பகலென்னும்பண்பின்மை பார஧க்கும் நோய். ,translates to :Hatred is a plague that divides And rouses illwill on all sides,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural, Kural 851, speaks about the destructive nature of hatred and disunity. The verse metaphorically refers to hatred as a disease that promotes discord and disunion among all living beings. \n\nThe term 'Igal' in Tamil signifies 'hatred' or 'enmity'. The verse emphasizes that hatred is a malady that prevents unity and harmony among all creatures. This hatred can manifest in various forms such as animosity, prejudice, discrimination, or hostility. It is detrimental as it fosters division and conflict, rather than peace and unity. \n\nThe wisdom of the verse lies in acknowledging that hatred is a destructive force that hinders the social cohesion and collective growth of all living beings. The 'wise' referred to in the verse are those who understand this and regard hatred as a disease that needs to be cured. \n\nTherefore, the moral interpretation of this verse is a call for unity, harmony and mutual respect among all creatures. It underlines the importance of overcoming hatred and fostering love and understanding for a harmonious coexistence..The kural verse:பகல்கருதிப் பற்றா செயினும் இகல்கருதிஇன்னாசெய் யாமை தலை. ,translates to :Rouse not hatred and confusion Though foes provoke disunion,and it's explantion is :The Kural 852 talks about the virtue of avoiding causing pain or harm to others, even if they have acted out of disagreement or animosity towards us. It emphasizes the moral high ground of not responding to hate with hate, or discord with discord.\n\nThe verse imparts wisdom on the importance of maintaining a peaceful demeanor, even in the face of opposition or discord. It advises that even if someone does disagreeable things to us out of disunity or animosity, we should refrain from retaliating with actions that might cause them pain or suffering. \n\nThis teaching is aligned with the principle of non-violence and compassion towards all, irrespective of their behavior towards us. It encourages tolerance, understanding, and forgiveness, rather than revenge or retaliation. This virtue is often seen as a mark of maturity and wisdom, as it promotes harmony and reduces conflict and suffering. \n\nIn essence, Kural 852 underlines the principle of not meeting hatred with hatred, but rather choosing the path of peace, understanding, and non-retaliation. It is a call for rising above personal grudges or differences and refraining from causing harm to others, even if they have wronged us..The kural verse:இகலென்னும் எவ்வநோய் நீக்கின் தவலில்லாத்தாவில் விளக்கம் தரும். ,translates to :Shun the plague of enmity And win everlasting glory,and it's explantion is :Kural 853 focuses on the destructive nature of hatred and the immense benefits of eliminating it from one's life. This verse refers to hatred as a 'distressing disease', implying that it is not a natural state of being, but rather a harmful condition that causes discomfort and suffering. The verse further emphasizes that ridding oneself of this disease can provide one with a 'never-decreasing imperishable fame'. This suggests that freedom from hatred not only brings personal peace and happiness, but also recognition and respect from others.\n\nIn many cultures, hatred is seen as a negative emotion that hinders personal growth and social harmony. It causes stress, conflict, and misunderstanding, leading to a life of discomfort and disconnection from others. On the contrary, those who are free from hatred are often appreciated and admired for their positive and harmonious attitude towards others. They are seen as role models who inspire others to live in peace and harmony. \n\nTherefore, this verse promotes the idea of letting go of hatred to achieve a state of eternal respect and admiration, thus leading a peaceful, harmonious, and fulfilling life. It encourages individuals to practice forgiveness, understanding, and acceptance, thus contributing to personal growth and social harmony..The kural verse:இன்பத்துள் இன்பம் பயக்கும் இகலென்னும்துன்பத்துள் துன்பங் கெடின். ,translates to :Hate-the woe of woes destroy; Then joy of joys you can enjoy,and it's explantion is :Kural 854 speaks about the profound power of removing hatred, which is considered the greatest source of suffering, from one's heart. The verse emphasizes that eliminating this negative emotion can lead to immeasurable joy and contentment.\n\nThe verse is rooted in the principle of harmony and peaceful coexistence, urging us to rid ourselves of hatred and animosity. It points out that hatred is the root cause of most of our miseries. When we harbor hatred, it does not merely affect the person we despise but also leads to our own mental suffering and distress. \n\nBy eradicating this destructive emotion, we not only free ourselves from a significant cause of pain but also open the doors to immense happiness and inner peace. The happiness resulting from the absence of hatred is portrayed as the most significant joy, highlighting the profound impact such a positive transformation can have on our lives.\n\nIn essence, this verse encourages us to practice forgiveness and compassion, promoting a peaceful and harmonious way of life. It underlines the idea that the key to our happiness lies within us, in our ability to let go of our negative emotions and embrace love and understanding..The kural verse:இகலெதிர் சாய்ந்தொழுக வல்லாரை யாரேமிக்லூக்கும் தன்மை யவர். ,translates to :Who can overcome them in glory That are free from enmity?,and it's explantion is :Kural 855 emphasizes the virtue of overcoming hatred and animosity. The verse implies that those who have the strength to resist and move away from hatred are truly powerful. The question posed at the end, \"Who indeed would think of conquering those who naturally shrink back from hatred ?\", underscores the idea that such individuals are invincible in their moral strength. \n\nThe essence of this kural is about the power of love, peace, and understanding. It suggests that individuals who can rise above hatred, not letting it foster in their hearts, but instead respond with compassion and understanding, are truly powerful. Such people are not easily defeated by any adversities or conflicts because their strength lies in their ability to abstain from negativity and foster positivity. \n\nIn a broader context, this verse promotes the idea of peace and non-violence. It advocates for a harmonious society where conflicts are resolved not by amplifying hatred but by embracing understanding and reconciliation. The verse suggests that the real strength of a person lies not in defeating others but in overcoming one's own negative emotions. \n\nSo, this verse essentially challenges the conventional notion of victory and defeat. It proposes that the true victor is not the one who overpowers others, but the one who has the ability to resist and retreat from sentiments of hatred and animosity..The kural verse:இகலின் மிகலினிது என்பவன் வாழ்க்கைதவலும் கெடலும் நணித்து. ,translates to :His fall and ruin are quite near Who holds enmity sweet and dear,and it's explantion is :Kural 856 discusses the destructive nature of hatred and the consequences faced by those who indulge in it. The verse warns that those who find satisfaction or delight in fostering animosity and maintaining a state of discord with others will inevitably face failure and ruin in their lives.\n\nThis kural emphasizes peace and harmony as core values, and indicates that those who deviate from these principles, engaging in hostility and conflict, will not prosper. The verse suggests that embracing hatred and enmity is a sure path to downfall. The bitterness and negativity generated by such attitudes can cloud judgment, lead to poor decisions, and eventually, disaster.\n\nIn essence, the kural advises to avoid hatred and to strive for understanding and concord in all our interactions. The underlying principle is universal and timeless, relevant to personal relationships, social interactions, and even in the context of global politics. The message is clear: fostering hatred leads to destruction, while cultivating understanding and harmony promotes prosperity and wellbeing..The kural verse:மிகல்மேவல் மெய்ப்பொருள் காணார் இகல்மேவல்இன்னா அறிவி னவர். ,translates to :They cannot see the supreme Truth Who hate and injure without ruth,and it's explantion is :Kural 857 is a profound reflection on the nature of enmity and understanding. In simple English, it means that those individuals who possess harmful wisdom and are filled with hostility, are unable to comprehend the true meaning or essence of success. \n\nThe Kural highlights the fact that a person consumed by hatred and ill-will is blinded by their own negative emotions, preventing them from recognizing the genuine path to victory or success. The \"true meaning\" or \"reality\" here can be interpreted as the principles of righteousness, fairness, and morality, which are often the keys to genuine success and fulfillment. \n\nIn other words, this verse underscores that negative emotions and harmful intent can cloud one's judgment and hinder their ability to understand and implement ethical and moral principles that are often associated with true success. It implies that true wisdom lies not in fostering enmity but in cultivating understanding, compassion, and righteousness..The kural verse:இகலிற்கு எதிர்சாய்தல் ஆக்கம் அதனைமிக்லூக்கின் ஊக்குமாம் கேடு. ,translates to :To turn from enmity is gain Fomenting it brings fast ruin,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of overcoming feelings of hatred and animosity, highlighting the detrimental effects of fostering such negative emotions. The first line suggests that choosing not to indulge in hatred and instead working towards overcoming it can lead to wealth. This \"wealth\" can be interpreted both materially and spiritually. Materially, it could mean success and prosperity, while spiritually, it could refer to inner peace and enlightenment.\n\nThe second line warns against the consequences of indulging in and intensifying hatred. It suggests that fostering such negative feelings can only lead to ruin and disaster. This \"ruin\" is indicative of both personal downfall, which may include loss of reputation, relationships, and peace of mind, as well as societal downfall, contributing to discord and conflicts. \n\nIn essence, the verse advocates for the cultivation of tolerance, understanding, and forgiveness, warning against the harmful effects of harboring hatred and resentment. It encourages us to rise above petty differences and animosities, as indulging in them could lead to personal and societal harm, while overcoming them leads to prosperity and peace..The kural verse:இகல்காணான் ஆக்கம் வருங்கால் அதனைமிகல்காணும் கேடு தரற்கு. ,translates to :Fortune favours when hate recedes Hatred exceeding ruin breeds,and it's explantion is :This couplet from Thirukkural speaks about human nature, particularly about how people perceive and react to fortune and adversity. It essentially suggests that when wealth or good fortune comes to a person, they tend not to harbor any enmity or hatred. They are likely to be more forgiving, considerate, and less focused on their differences with others because their immediate needs and desires are fulfilled.\n\nHowever, the second half of the couplet warns that when the same person is faced with adversity or misfortune, their perspective changes. They are more prone to magnify any differences, conflicts, or animosity, sometimes even without a valid cause. This is often because they are looking for someone to blame for their misfortune or are trying to protect what little they have left. The verse ultimately serves as a reminder to maintain equanimity and fairness in all circumstances, irrespective of personal fortune or misfortune..The kural verse:இகலானாம் இன்னாத எல்லாம் நகலானாம்நன்னயம் என்னும் செருக்கு. ,translates to :All evils come from enmity All goodness flow from amity,and it's explantion is :This Kural (verse) emphasizes the powerful influence of our relationships and interpersonal dynamics on the quality of our life. It states that all forms of suffering stem from enmity or hatred. When we harbor negative feelings like resentment or animosity towards others, it inevitably leads to discord, conflict and various forms of hardship. This could manifest as stress, tension, fear, or even physical harm in extreme cases.\n\nOn the other hand, the verse points out that friendship, with its inherent qualities of understanding, empathy and mutual respect, brings about a wealth of virtues. It is through the bond of friendship that we cultivate and exhibit good qualities such as kindness, generosity, forgiveness and honesty. These virtues not only enrich our own lives but also positively impact the lives of those around us, creating a harmonious and productive society.\n\nIn essence, the Kural highlights the profound impact of our attitudes and actions towards others on our own well-being. It urges us to foster goodwill and harmony, and to avoid hatred and strife, for lasting peace and prosperity..The kural verse:வலியார்க்கு மாறேற்றல் ஓம்புக ஓம்பாமெலியார்மேல் மேக பகை. ,translates to :Turn from strife with foes too strong With the feeble for battle long,and it's explantion is :Kural 861 advises a strategic approach towards conflict based on the relative strength of the opponent. The verse suggests that it is wise not to directly confront or resist those who are stronger, as it could lead to unnecessary struggle and potential loss. This does not mean that one should submit or show weakness, but rather implies understanding one's own capabilities and picking battles wisely.\n\nOn the other hand, the verse also calls for not disregarding enmity towards those who are weaker than oneself. This does not endorse bullying or exploiting the weak, but rather cautions against underestimating them. This is because even the seemingly weak can pose a threat if their enmity is disregarded or overlooked. \n\nIn essence, the Kural teaches the importance of discernment in conflict situations, advising one to avoid direct confrontation with the strong while not overlooking any potential threats from the weak. This verse can be applied not just in physical conflicts but also in intellectual, emotional, and diplomatic scenarios..The kural verse:அன்பிலன் ஆன்ற துணையிலன் தான்துவ்வான்என்பரியும் ஏதிலான் துப்பு. ,translates to :Loveless, aidless, powerless king Can he withstand an enemy strong?,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 862, explores the importance of love, strength, and strong alliances in overcoming adversaries. \n\nThe verse suggests that a person without love, powerful allies, and personal strength stands little chance of defeating a strong enemy. Love here is a representation of goodwill and kindness towards others, a quality that often earns one the support and loyalty of others. The 'powerful aids' refer to alliances or partnerships that can provide assistance in times of need. Lastly, personal strength can be physical, mental, or moral strength, which provides resilience and courage to face adversities.\n\nTherefore, the verse underlines that a person devoid of love, support from powerful allies, and individual strength, is likely to struggle in overcoming challenges or adversaries. This verse is a reminder of the importance of cultivating love, forming strong alliances, and building personal strength to successfully navigate through life's challenges and conflicts..The kural verse:அஞ்சும் அறியான் அமைவிலன் ஈகலான்தஞ்சம் எளியன் பகைக்கு. ,translates to :Unskilled, timid, miser, misfit He is easy for foes to hit,and it's explantion is :Kural 863 examines the characteristics that make a person weak in the face of their enemies. The verse identifies four such traits: timidity, ignorance, unsociability, and stinginess. \n\nTo begin with, fear or timidity is seen as a debilitating trait. A person who is constantly afraid will not be able to think or act decisively, making them an easy target for their opponents. \n\nSecondly, ignorance is another weakness. Knowledge equips a person with the ability to make informed decisions and take calculated risks. Without it, one is likely to make mistakes and falter in their endeavors.\n\nThirdly, being unsociable or not having the ability to get along with others can also be a disadvantage. In any conflict or competition, alliances and collaborations often prove crucial. A person who is unable to build or maintain such relationships is at a disadvantage.\n\nLastly, stinginess or a lack of generosity is seen as a negative trait. It suggests a narrowness of mind and a lack of empathy, qualities that could isolate a person and make them vulnerable.\n\nIn conclusion, the verse suggests that a person possessing these four traits - timidity, ignorance, unsociability, and stinginess - is likely to be perceived as weak by their adversaries, thus becoming an easy target. This Kural serves as a reminder of the importance of courage, knowledge, sociability, and generosity in strengthening one's position and standing in society..The kural verse:நீங்கான் வெகுளி நிறையிலன் எஞ்ஞான்றும்யாங்கணும் யார்க்கும் எளிது. ,translates to :The wrathful restive man is prey To any, anywhere any day,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 864, from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of controlling one's anger and maintaining discretion. \n\nThe verse suggests that an individual who is unable to control his anger and fails to keep his secrets is likely to be easily overpowered by others at all times and in all places. This means that such a person can be easily manipulated or controlled by others because of their lack of control over their emotions and inability to keep personal or sensitive information confidential.\n\nThe verse underscores the importance of emotional intelligence and discretion in our lives. Anger is a powerful and often destructive emotion that can cloud judgment and lead to impulsive actions, while discretion is the ability to keep sensitive information confidential, which is crucial for maintaining trust and respect in interpersonal relationships.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse teaches us that self-control and discretion are key elements of personal strength and resilience. Those who lack these qualities are easily manipulated and defeated by others, highlighting the importance of mastering one's emotions and maintaining confidentiality. \n\nTherefore, the verse implores us to cultivate self-control and discretion, not only for our personal growth but also to maintain our dignity and respect in the society..The kural verse:வழிநோக்கான் வாய்ப்பன செய்யான் பழிநோக்கான்பண்பிலன் பற்றார்க்கு இனிது. ,translates to :Crooked, cruel, tactless and base Any foe can fell him with ease,and it's explantion is :The Kural 865 emphasizes the importance of moral and ethical development for an individual. It states that a person who doesn't study moral teachings, fails to act according to them, disregards criticism and lacks virtuous qualities becomes an easy target for their enemies. \n\nThis verse suggests that understanding and applying moral principles, embracing constructive feedback, and cultivating good qualities are essential for one's growth and protection. A person who neglects these aspects becomes vulnerable and pleasing to their foes, as they are easily defeated or manipulated due to their lack of moral grounding and good traits. \n\nThe verse underscores the significance of moral education and personal development in building a strong character that can withstand external pressures and adversities. It also warns of the consequences of ignoring these aspects, being a potential advantage to one's enemies. This Kural, hence, serves as a reminder to continuously strive for moral and personal growth and to be vigilant of our actions and their implications..The kural verse:காணாச் சினத்தான் கழிபெருங் காமத்தான்பேணாமை பேணப் படும். ,translates to :Blind in rage and mad in lust To have his hatred is but just,and it's explantion is :Kural 866 advises about the people who are driven by uncontrolled anger and insatiable desire. The verse suggests that it is prudent to be wary of such individuals, and perhaps even desirable to make them your adversaries as their actions are likely to be irrational and harmful.\n\nThe verse mentions two key characteristics. The first is uncontrolled anger, which is often blind, leading to rash decisions without considering the consequences. This can be destructive both for the individual and those around them. The second is an insatiable lust or desire, which also leads to reckless and irresponsible actions, as the person is consumed by their desires and disregards ethics and morals.\n\nThus, the verse highlights the dangers of associating with such individuals. It suggests that it might be better to have such people as enemies rather than allies, as their behavior can be detrimental to one's well-being and peace. \n\nThe verse also underscores the importance of self-control, balance, and moderation in emotions and desires, indirectly implying that these are the traits of a virtuous individual..The kural verse:கொடுத்தும் கொளல்வேண்டும் மன்ற அடுத்திருந்துமாணாத செய்வான் பகை. ,translates to :Pay and buy his enmity Who muddles chance with oddity,and it's explantion is :The Kural 867 emphasizes the necessity to distance oneself from individuals who initiate a task and then indulge in activities that are counterproductive to its successful completion. It goes to the extent of advising that one should be willing to pay a price, if necessary, to earn the enmity of such a person - for their detrimental actions can lead to the undermining of the task's objectives, and potentially cause harm or loss.\n\nThe verse reiterates the importance of aligning one's actions with the goal at hand. When someone is involved in a task, their actions and decisions should be conducive to the successful completion of that task. If their actions are counterproductive, it not only hampers the progress of the task, but also affects the team or individuals associated with it. \n\nIn essence, the verse is an advice to avoid association with individuals who do not contribute positively towards a common goal. Their negative impact could be so severe that it might be worth paying a price to sever ties with them. This is true in various realms of life, be it personal relationships, professional partnerships or leadership and governance..The kural verse:குணனிலனாய்க் குற்றம் பலவாயின் மாற்றார்க்குஇனனிலனாம் ஏமாப் புடைத்து. ,translates to :With no virtue but full of vice He loses friends and delights foes,and it's explantion is :The Kural 868 stresses the importance of virtuous qualities and the negative consequences of being devoid of them. A person who lacks good qualities and is filled with faults will not only find himself isolated from friends and allies but also becomes an easy target for his enemies. \n\nIn essence, this verse underscores the need for cultivating positive attributes and eliminating negative ones. It suggests that one's character is crucial in determining one's social standing and resilience against adversities. A flawed character not only pushes away potential allies but also empowers one's adversaries, thereby making the person vulnerable and weak. \n\nThis Kural is a reminder of the dire consequences of lacking virtue and having abundant vices, making it a profound piece of advice for personal growth and social harmony..The kural verse:செறுவார்க்குச் சேணிகவா இன்பம் அறிவிலாஅஞ்சும் பகைவர்ப் பெறின். ,translates to :The joy of heroes knows no bounds When timid fools are opponents,and it's explantion is :The Kural 869 essentially emphasizes the advantage of having adversaries who are both ignorant and fearful. If one's enemies lack understanding and are constantly apprehensive, victory becomes easier and more rewarding for the person who confronts them.\n\nThis Kural sheds light on two major weaknesses — ignorance and fear. Ignorance refers to the lack of knowledge or understanding, while fear signifies the inability to confront or handle situations. Both these traits are considered detrimental, particularly in an adversary, as they hinder their ability to respond effectively in a conflict or challenge.\n\nFor those who face such adversaries, the joy of triumph remains unending. This is because, the victory over such opponents is easily attainable and largely uncontested. In a broader perspective, this verse could be seen as a commentary on the importance of knowledge and courage in life. It suggests that to be successful and formidable, one must strive to be knowledgeable and fearless. \n\nIt also subtly implies the responsibility of the victorious to use their triumph for good, given that their success has been achieved over the weak and uninformed. This moral undertone is a common theme in Thirukkural, promoting not just personal success but also societal ethics and responsibility..The kural verse:கல்லான் வெகுளும் சிறுபொருள் எஞ்ஞான்றும்ஒல்லானை ஒல்லா தொளி. ,translates to :Glory's light he will not gain Who fails to fight a fool and win,and it's explantion is :Kural 870 deals with the concept of true valor and reputation. The verse suggests that a person who refrains from confronting an unlearned adversary, fearing the trivial fame that might come from such a trivial victory, will never attain the greater light of lasting fame. In other words, a person who avoids even a minor challenge due to the fear of being criticized for picking an easy fight will never achieve true glory or recognition.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that real bravery lies not in the magnitude of the challenge faced, but in the willingness to face any challenge, big or small. It also highlights the importance of learning and knowledge in distinguishing a worthy opponent from an unworthy one. \n\nSo, the essence of this verse is about the courage to face any challenge, regardless of its size or importance, and the wisdom to recognise the true value of an adversary. This courage and wisdom, in turn, are the keys to achieving lasting fame and respect. \n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse also encourages humility, fairness, and the pursuit of knowledge. It discourages arrogance and the desire for easy victories over weak opponents..The kural verse:பகைஎன்னும் பண்பி லதனை ஒருவன்நகையேயும் வேண்டற்பாற்று அன்று. ,translates to :Let not one even as a sport The ill-natured enmity court,and it's explantion is :The verse 871 of Thirukkural says that hatred, being contrary to good conduct, should not be entertained by anyone even in jest. \n\nThe verse emphasizes the destructive nature of hatred and advises against indulging in it under any circumstances. Even if it is in a light-hearted or playful context, fostering feelings of hatred can have detrimental effects on an individual's character and relationships. \n\nThe cultural context of this verse lies in the Tamil tradition of valuing harmony, peace, and goodwill among people. According to this tradition, fostering negative emotions like hatred, even for fun, is considered harmful and undesirable. \n\nThe moral interpretation of this verse advocates for the cultivation of positive emotions and the avoidance of negative ones, regardless of the context or situation. It calls for emotional discipline and the promotion of love and understanding over hatred and conflict. \n\nIn essence, this verse warns against the perils of harboring hatred, even in jest, and promotes peace, love, and harmony as essential aspects of good conduct and character..The kural verse:வில்லேர் உழவர் பகைகொளினும் கொள்ளற்கசொல்லேர் உழவர் பகை. ,translates to :Incur the hate of bow-ploughers But not the hate of word-ploughers,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse emphasizes the power of words over physical might. The verse states that while it may be tolerable to bear the enmity of warriors, whose primary weapon is physical force symbolized by their bows, it is not advisable to antagonize ministers or scholars, whose primary weapon is their words.\n\nThe metaphor of warriors' bows and ministers' words as their respective 'ploughs' is used to underline their primary tools of influence. A plough is a tool used in farming to prepare the soil for sowing seeds. Similarly, a warrior uses his bow to establish order and a minister uses his words to shape ideas and policies.\n\nThe verse suggests that the impact of words can be more potent and long-lasting than physical force. A physical attack can cause harm, but it is transient and can be healed over time. However, the impact of words, especially those of influential ministers or scholars, can shape public opinion, alter perceptions, and have far-reaching consequences that can last generations.\n\nIn a broader sense, the verse underscores the importance of maintaining good relations with those who wield influence through their wisdom and knowledge. It advises us to respect the power of words and the impact they can have on our lives and society at large. It also implies the significance of diplomacy and tact over aggression and hostility..The kural verse:ஏமுற் றவரினும் ஏழை தமியனாய்ப்பல்லார் பகைகொள் பவன். ,translates to :Forlorn, who rouses many foes The worst insanity betrays,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse 873 emphasizes the foolishness of a person who, despite being alone, consciously instigates animosity with many individuals. It suggests that such person is more unwise than even those who are insane.\n\nThe verse is a critique of those who, out of pride, arrogance or ignorance, intentionally or unintentionally, make enemies out of many, even when they are alone and outnumbered. This could result in their downfall, as they are stirring up hatred and conflict without any support or strength on their side. \n\nThiruvalluvar, the author of Thirukural, advises against such imprudent actions and implies that wisdom lies in maintaining harmony and fostering goodwill, especially when one is in a vulnerable or isolated position. \n\nThe verse is particularly relevant in the context of leadership, where a leader who generates hostility among his followers or peers, despite being a solitary figure, is setting himself up for failure. This includes rulers, administrators, or anyone in a position of power. \n\nIn essence, the verse is a call for wisdom, prudence, and tact in dealing with others, particularly in situations of potential conflict or disharmony..The kural verse:பகைநட்பாக் கொண்டொழுகும் பண்புடை யாளன்தகைமைக்கண் தங்கிற்று உலகு. ,translates to :This world goes safely in his grace Whose heart makes friends even of foes,and it's explantion is :Kural 874 is a verse that champions the power of magnanimity and diplomacy. It suggests that a person who can turn his enemies into friends through his gracious and congenial conduct is a person of great nobility and worth. Such a person's rule and influence can command the respect and admiration of the world.\n\nIn the context of kingship or leadership, the ability to transform enmity into friendship is a valuable trait. It shows the leader's skill in diplomacy, negotiation and conflict resolution. It's not about suppressing or eliminating enemies, but about turning adversaries into allies through understanding, compassion and mutual respect.\n\nThis principle is also applicable in personal life, where one can win over adversaries with kindness, understanding and a positive attitude. \n\nIn essence, this verse from Thiru Kural underlines the power of magnanimity, diplomacy and the ability to transform hostility into harmony as the qualities that bring respect and admiration from the world. It is about winning hearts, not battles..The kural verse:தன்துணை இன்றால் பகையிரண்டால் தான்ஒருவன்இன்துணையாக் கொள்கவற்றின் ஒன்று. ,translates to :Alone, if two foes you oppose Make one of them your ally close,and it's explantion is :Kural 875 advises on the strategy of diplomacy and alliance, particularly when one is in a vulnerable position. It suggests that when an individual finds himself alone and against two enemies, he should strive to align himself with one of them, transforming the enemy into an ally. \n\nThis verse underscores the importance of adaptability and strategic alliances in challenging circumstances. In essence, it advocates the principle of \"divide and conquer.\" By turning an adversary into a friend, one can ensure a more balanced power dynamic in dealing with the remaining foe. \n\nIt's a practical counsel that applies not only to political spheres, but also to personal conflicts, business competition, and any situation where one is pitted against multiple adversaries. The wisdom of this verse lies in its suggestion to turn adversity into an opportunity and use the available resources, even if they initially appear as threats, to one's advantage. \n\nThe verse is a testament to Thiruvalluvar's profound understanding of human dynamics and his practical approach to problem-solving. It highlights the need for wisdom, tact, and strategic thinking in life's various battles..The kural verse:தேறினும் தேறா விடினும் அழிவின்கண்தேறான் பகாஅன் விடல். ,translates to :Trust or distrust; during distress Keep aloof; don't mix with foes,and it's explantion is :Kural 876 offers a pragmatic approach to dealing with adversaries during times of personal adversity. Thiruvalluvar, the author, advises that whether or not one's foe is aware of one's misfortune, it is wise to maintain a balanced relationship with them - neither getting too close nor distancing oneself completely.\n\nThe verse underscores the importance of showing neither vulnerability nor hostility towards one's foes during times of difficulty. Thiruvalluvar suggests a middle path that neither gives the foe an opportunity to exploit one's weakness nor alienates them to the point of intensifying the enmity.\n\nIn essence, the verse teaches the virtue of tact and diplomacy in managing relationships with adversaries, especially in trying times. It emphasizes the value of strategic neutrality and the importance of maintaining one's dignity and composure, regardless of the circumstances. \n\nThis Kural is a testament to Thiruvalluvar's deep understanding of human nature and his wise counsel on navigating complex social dynamics. It reminds us that in the face of adversity, one's strength lies not just in withstanding the challenge, but also in skillfully managing one's relationships..The kural verse:நோவற்க நொந்தது அறியார்க்கு மேவற்கமென்மை பகைவர் அகத்து. ,translates to :To those who know not, tell not your pain Nor your weakness to foes explain,and it's explantion is :This Thirukkural verse emphasizes the importance of discretion and resilience in the face of adversity. It advises not to share one's troubles with friends who are unaware of them, as it may burden them or they may not be able to fully comprehend or help. Similarly, it discourages showing one's weakness in front of one's enemies as it may give them an advantage.\n\nIn essence, this verse encourages the practice of endurance and maintaining a strong front even in times of difficulty. It emphasizes the value of self-reliance and discretion. It also underlines the importance of understanding the potential consequences of one's actions, cautioning against revealing vulnerabilities to those who may exploit them. \n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse also highlights the importance of emotional intelligence, suggesting that one must be aware of their personal struggles but also be discerning about who to share these struggles with. Not everyone might be capable of understanding or responding appropriately to such disclosures. It also subtly hints at the importance of resilience and self-reliance, encouraging individuals to face and overcome their challenges independently..The kural verse:வகையறிந்து தற்செய்து தற்காப்ப மாயும்பகைவர்கண் பட்ட செருக்கு. ,translates to :Know how and act and defend well The pride of enemies shall fall,and it's explantion is :Kural 878 is about strategic self-preservation and resourcefulness. It stresses on the importance of understanding the circumstances (or 'the way' of acting) and ensuring one's own strength and safety. The verse suggests that the key to defeat one's enemies is not necessarily by attacking them, but by strengthening oneself and staying secure.\n\nThe first line 'vagaiyarindhu tharcheydhu' means understanding the situation and acting accordingly. This encompasses being aware of one's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. It advises one to act wisely based on this understanding.\n\nThe second line 'tharkaappu maayum' advises securing one's own safety or protection. This could mean building alliances, gathering resources, enhancing one's skills, or any other act that would improve one's position and security.\n\nThe third line 'pagaivarkaN patta serukku' refers to the fear or anxiety that arises in the minds of one's enemies. When one acts wisely and ensures their safety, it naturally instills fear in the minds of their opponents. The enemies' joy or confidence in seeing one's downfall will be destroyed, as they see the person acting wisely and staying secure.\n\nThe kural underlines the importance of strategic thinking, self-preservation, and the strength of character. It advises us to focus more on our growth and security, which in turn can naturally lead to the defeat of one's enemies. The essence of this kural is that the best defense is often a good offense. But in this case, the 'offense' is not an attack on the enemy, but the act of empowering oneself and ensuring one's safety..The kural verse:இளைதாக முள்மரம் கொல்க களையுநர்கைகொல்லும் காழ்த்த இடத்து. ,translates to :Cut off thorn-trees when young they are; Grown hard, they cut your hands beware,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural highlights the importance of preventing potential dangers in their early stages. It uses the metaphor of a thorny tree, advising that it should be cut down while it's still young and manageable. If left to grow, the tree can cause harm to the person attempting to fell it later on, when it's fully grown and its thorns are sharp and dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, this verse also applies to human interactions and conflicts. It suggests that one should address disputes or disagreements at their inception before they escalate into larger, more harmful conflicts. The 'thorny tree' here symbolizes any potential harm or threat that might grow over time if not addressed promptly. \n\nIn a broader context, this Kural also emphasizes the wisdom of foresight and proactive measures in all aspects of life. It encourages not to ignore small problems or challenges, as they can grow into significant threats if left unchecked. As such, this verse serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of complacency and the value of taking timely action..The kural verse:உயிர்ப்ப உளரல்லர் மன்ற செயிர்ப்பவர்செம்மல் சிதைக்கலா தார். ,translates to :To breathe on earth they are not fit Defying foes who don't defeat,and it's explantion is :Kural 880 addresses the importance of assertiveness in the face of adversity, particularly when dealing with adversaries or those who bear ill-will towards us. It states that those who fail to challenge or diminish the arrogance of their enemies will not be able to maintain their own existence. \n\nThe verse emphasizes the concept of survival and the need for self-preservation in a world fraught with conflict and rivalry. It essentially asserts that if one does not stand their ground and confront those who wish them harm, they risk their very existence. This confrontation doesn't necessarily mean physical aggression but could also include intellectual or moral assertiveness.\n\nThis Kural encourages the readers to be strong in the face of their enemies, to not be passive, and to assertively counteract the threats they pose. It is a call to action for maintaining one's dignity and self-respect, by not allowing others to trample over them. \n\nThis verse does not promote violence or revenge, but rather the will to stay resilient and assertive in the face of adversity, and the courage to stand firm against those who aim to undermine one's existence. The moral implication is that preserving one's self-respect and dignity is crucial for survival..The kural verse:நிழல்நீரும் இன்னாத இன்னா தமர்நீரும்இன்னாவாம் இன்னா செயின். ,translates to :Traitorous kinsmen will make you sad As water and shade do harm when bad,and it's explantion is :The Kural verse 881 emphasizes on the concept of utility and consequence in determining the value of something or someone. The verse uses the metaphor of shade and water, which are typically seen as sources of comfort and life. However, if the shade is a source of disease or if the water is polluted, they no longer bring comfort but cause harm instead. Similarly, in our relationships, if the people who are supposed to bring joy and support end up causing pain and distress, their presence in our lives loses its value.\n\nIn simpler terms, this verse is teaching us that the inherent qualities or the outward appearance of something or someone doesn't determine their true value, but their impact on us does. Whether it's a thing or a person, if they cause harm or discomfort, they are not beneficial, regardless of their inherent qualities or intentions.\n\nThis verse is a reminder to assess our relationships and surroundings based on the impact they have on our lives. It encourages us to seek relationships that are supportive and nurturing, and to avoid those that cause distress or harm. It also calls for mindfulness in our interactions and the need to be discerning in our associations. It's a timeless wisdom about discernment and the importance of positive influence in our lives..The kural verse:வாள்போல பகைவரை அஞ்சற்க அஞ்சுககேள்போல் பகைவர் தொடர்பு. ,translates to :You need not sword-like kinsmen fear Fear foes who feign as kinsmen dear,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse (Kural 882) emphasizes on the dangers of hidden enemies compared to open adversaries. The verse advises not to fear enemies who threaten like a brandished sword, as their intentions are clear and we can prepare ourselves accordingly against them. However, it warns to be wary of those who behave like friends on the surface but nurse enmity in their hearts. \n\nThe danger from such enemies is far greater because their ill-intentions are concealed under the guise of friendship, making it harder to anticipate their moves or defend against their actions. This verse imparts the wisdom that it's often the concealed enmity that's more dangerous than the one that's openly expressed. \n\nIn a broader sense, it is an advice about discernment and caution in relationships, highlighting the importance of understanding and assessing people's intentions before trusting them completely..The kural verse:உட்பகை அஞ்சித்தற் காக்க உலைவிடத்துமட்பகையின் மாணத் தெறும். ,translates to :The secret foe in days evil Will cut you, beware, like potters' steel,and it's explantion is :Kural 883 emphasizes the importance of being cautious about internal enmity or conflicts within oneself. It points out that these internal struggles can be as dangerous and destructive as an external enemy, if not more. \n\nThe verse uses the metaphor of a tool that cuts the potter's clay. The clay, when in the hands of the potter, has the potential to be shaped into a beautiful pot or vessel. However, if a tool cuts through it at the wrong time, the clay loses its potential and is destroyed. Similarly, if a person does not guard against their internal conflicts and struggles, they can be destroyed at a vulnerable moment, just like the potter's clay. \n\nThis Kural encourages us to be aware of and manage our internal struggles effectively. It could refer to a range of internal conflicts, from self-doubt and anxiety to greed and jealousy. These internal enemies, if left unchecked, can lead to one's downfall, especially when they strike during times of weakness or crisis. \n\nTherefore, it's critical to be vigilant about these internal struggles and to take steps to manage them effectively, to prevent them from causing harm during crucial moments in life. The Kural advises that fear of these internal enemies can be a motivating factor in guard oneself against them. \n\nThe moral of this verse is about self-awareness, self-management, and the importance of maintaining mental and emotional balance, to lead a successful and fulfilling life. As such, it remains highly relevant even today..The kural verse:மனமாணா உட்பகை தோன்றின் இனமாணாஏதம் பலவும் தரும். ,translates to :The evil-minded foe within Foments trouble, spoils kinsmen!,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 884, speaks about the detrimental effects of internal hostility, which is a form of enmity that is concealed and not outwardly expressed. Such hidden malice, according to Thiruvalluvar, can lead to numerous problems and can even cause discord among one's own kin and kith. \n\nThe verse suggests that if a person harbors ill feelings or resentment in their heart and doesn't reform or address them, it can give rise to many evils. These negative emotions can manifest in various forms, creating a ripple effect of harm and discordance, not only affecting the individual themselves but also their relationships. \n\nThe most destructive aspect of this kind of covert enmity is that it can turn one's own family members or close relations against them, causing disaffection and estrangement. This, in turn, can lead to numerous complexities and problems, further escalating the situation. \n\nIn essence, the verse is a cautionary message about the dangers of harboring grudges or ill-will within oneself. It underscores the importance of maintaining a clear and positive mind, free from any form of hostility, for the sake of personal well-being and harmonious relationships..The kural verse:உறல்முறையான் உட்பகை தோன்றின் இறல்முறையான்ஏதம் பலவும் தரும். ,translates to :A traitor among kinsmen will Bring life-endangering evil,and it's explantion is :Kural 885 emphasizes the calamitous consequences that internal discord can have within a family, especially a ruling one. The verse metaphorically uses the term 'king's family' but it applies to any close-knit group or family. \n\nThe verse suggests that if animosity or hatred arises within a family or among close relatives, it leads to dire repercussions. This internal enmity, concealed beneath the surface, can lead to many grave crimes and disasters, all of which could ultimately lead to the downfall or destruction of the family or group. \n\nThe verse reminds us of the importance of maintaining harmony and unity within a family or group. It underlines how internal strife can be more destructive than external threats and can result in a multitude of problems. It also carries a subtle warning about the need to resolve conflicts within a family before they escalate into hatred or animosity. \n\nIn essence, the verse teaches us the value of unity, love, and understanding in maintaining the strength and integrity of any group or family. It reminds us that any form of internal discord is not just harmful to the individuals involved, but also to the collective entity they belong to..The kural verse:ஒன்றாமை ஒன்றியார் கட்படின் எஞ்ஞான்றும்பொன்றாமை ஒன்றல் அரிது. ,translates to :Discord in kings' circle entails Life-destroying deadly evils,and it's explantion is :Kural 886 emphasizes the hardship of escaping from the consequences when discord or enmity arises within a group that was once unified. This verse does not only apply to familial or social relationships, but also to political or leadership situations.\n\nThe verse warns against the danger of internal conflict. When unity is disrupted by hatred among the members of a group, the harm it causes is significant and nearly impossible to avoid. This is because the intimate knowledge each member has about the others can be used to inflict damage that's hard to defend against.\n\nIn a broader context, this verse can be applied to political situations. If there is discord within a ruling party or government, it can cause instability, and possibly lead to its downfall. It implies that maintaining internal peace and harmony is vital for the survival and prosperity of any group or organization.\n\nIn essence, this verse from Thirukkural teaches us the importance of unity and the dire consequences of internal strife. It encourages maintaining harmony and understanding among group members, be it a family, a community, or a nation..The kural verse:செப்பின் புணர்ச்சிபோல் கூடினும் கூடாதேஉட்பகை உற்ற குடி. ,translates to :A house hiding hostiles in core Just seems on like the lid in jar,and it's explantion is :Kural 887 addresses the concept of unity and its importance within a family or a group. The verse uses the metaphor of a casket and its lid to illustrate a false union. Just as a casket and its lid might seem to be in perfect cohesion on the outside, they are not inherently unified as they are separate entities. Similarly, a family or group might present a facade of unity externally, but if there is internal discord, the unity is merely superficial and not authentic.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that a family or group tainted by internal strife or hatred can't truly unite, despite appearances. The presence of mutual animosity and resentment prevents a genuine bond or connection from forming. The unity, in this case, is superficial and is unlikely to withstand the test of time or adversity.\n\nThis verse underscores the importance of harmony, understanding, and mutual respect within a family or a group. It suggests that true unity is not just about outward appearances but is about forming deep, meaningful bonds based on mutual respect and shared values. It serves as a reminder that internal discord can undermine the strength and stability of a family or group, regardless of how united it may seem externally. \n\nIn a broader context, this verse can also be applied to communities, societies, and nations. It suggests that a society riddled with internal conflicts, despite presenting a united front, will struggle to maintain peace and progress. Thus, the verse advocates for the resolution of internal conflicts and the promotion of unity for the overall well-being and progress of a family, group, or society..The kural verse:அரம்பொருத பொன்போலத் தேயும் உரம்பொருதுஉட்பகை உற்ற குடி. ,translates to :By secret spite the house wears out Like gold crumbling by file's contact,and it's explantion is :This Thirukkural verse 888 emphasizes the destructive impact of internal conflict and discord within a family or group. It compares a family riddled with internal feuds to a piece of iron that gradually wears away when continuously filed. Just as the iron loses its shape and strength due to the constant filing, a family embroiled in disagreements and hatred will lose its unity and strength over time. \n\nThe underlying message of this verse is the importance of harmony and unity within a family or group. It highlights that internal disputes and enmity can erode the stability and strength of a family, just as continuous filing can wear down a piece of iron. It is a cautionary reminder of the detrimental effects of internal discord and the importance of maintaining peace and unity within any collective group, be it a family, a community, or a nation. \n\nThis is a universal principle that applies beyond the family unit and can be extended to organizations, societies, and nations. The strength of any group lies in its unity and the ability of its members to work together towards common goals. When this unity is disrupted by internal strife, the group's strength and prosperity are inevitably diminished..The kural verse:எட்பக வன்ன சிறுமைத்தே ஆயினும்உட்பகை உள்ளதாங் கேடு. ,translates to :Ruin lurks in enmity As slit in sesame though it be,and it's explantion is :Kural 889 speaks about the detrimental effects of internal animosity or hidden hatred. It metaphorically compares this hidden hatred to a tiny sesame seed, emphasizing that even if such hatred is minuscule, it still has the potential to cause significant harm.\n\nThe sesame seed, although small, has the ability to grow into a plant. Similarly, even a small amount of internal hatred can grow and cause substantial damage. It might seem insignificant at first, but as it grows, it can lead to disruption, conflict, and destruction. \n\nThis verse warns about the dangers of nurturing resentment or enmity in one's heart and advises against harboring such feelings. It emphasizes the need for harmony and understanding in relationships, fostering goodwill rather than nurturing negative feelings. \n\nThe essence of this Kural is the potency of hidden hatred or resentment, regardless of its size. It teaches us the importance of forgiveness, understanding, and unity, as they are crucial for a peaceful and harmonious life..The kural verse:உடம்பாடு இலாதவர் வாழ்க்கை குடங்கருள்பாம்போடு உடனுறைந் தற்று. ,translates to :Dwell with traitors that hate in heart Is dwelling with snake in selfsame hut,and it's explantion is :Kural 890 is essentially a metaphorical expression that illustrates the danger and discomfort of living in disagreement with someone in close proximity. \n\nThe verse compares a life lived with those who do not agree with us to living in a small hut with a cobra. The cobra here symbolizes a threat or danger, just as disagreements and conflicts can be harmful to our peace and wellbeing. It suggests that living with someone who disagrees with us can be as dangerous and unsettling as sharing a space with a venomous snake. \n\nIt brings to our attention that harmony in our relationships is crucial for a peaceful life. If there is no mental compatibility or agreement in thoughts and actions, life becomes fraught with tension, akin to the constant fear one would experience living with a cobra in a confined space. \n\nIn essence, this Thirukural verse emphasizes the importance of understanding, harmony, and agreement in our interactions and relationships with others. It warns us of the constant stress and fear that comes from living with disagreement, beautifully illustrated through the metaphor of sharing a dwelling with a cobra..The kural verse:ஆற்றுவார் ஆற்றல் இகழாமை போற்றுவார்போற்றலுள் எல்லாம் தலை. ,translates to :Not to spite the mighty ones Safest safeguard to living brings,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse emphasizes the importance of respecting and acknowledging the abilities and power of those who can execute their tasks effectively. It suggests that such recognition is even more crucial than the constant vigilance that one might maintain to guard against adversities or threats.\n\nThe verse implies that not underestimating or belittling the capabilities of effective individuals not only shows respect and appreciation for their skills but also serves as a form of self-protection. This is because by recognizing their power, one can learn from them, avoid unnecessary conflicts, and maintain harmonious relationships.\n\nThe 'guard' or 'watchfulness' mentioned in the verse might refer to both physical protection against harm and the mental vigilance against negative influences or mistakes. However, acknowledging and respecting the power of capable individuals surpasses all these measures of safeguarding oneself, as it can lead to personal growth and peaceful coexistence. \n\nIn essence, the Kural advises us to respect the power of action, suggesting that recognizing and appreciating the abilities of those who can accomplish their desired tasks is a form of wisdom and self-protection that transcends all other forms of vigilance or guard..The kural verse:பெரியாரைப் பேணாது ஒழுகிற் பெரியாரால்பேரா இடும்பை தரும். ,translates to :To walk unmindful of the great Shall great troubles ceaseless create,and it's explantion is :This verse emphasizes the importance of respecting authority figures or those in positions of power. The verse warns that if one fails to show due respect or deference towards such individuals, it can lead to severe consequences that may cause irremediable harm or distress. \n\nThe cultural context of this verse is rooted in the traditional hierarchical social structures where respect towards those in higher positions, be it in terms of age, knowledge, or societal standing, is considered an essential virtue. Disregard for such authority may lead to discord, conflict, or harm, often of a magnitude that is hard to rectify.\n\nThe moral interpretation of the verse is a universal one. It advises prudence in dealing with those in power, suggesting that respect and deference can lead to harmony and peace, while disrespect and defiance can lead to trouble and harm. It's a reminder that mindful and respectful behavior towards authority is not just a matter of courtesy but a strategy for self-preservation and well-being. \n\nIn a broader sense, it can also be interpreted as a call for humility and respect towards those who are more experienced or knowledgeable, as their wisdom and guidance can be beneficial, while their displeasure or hostility can lead to difficulties..The kural verse:கெடல்வேண்டின் கேளாது செய்க அடல்வேண்டின்ஆற்று பவர்கண் இழுக்கு. ,translates to :Heed not and do, if ruin you want Offence against the mighty great,and it's explantion is :Kural 893 delves into the concept of self-destruction and the consequences of violating laws and principles. The verse suggests that if an individual wishes to invite ruin upon themselves, they can do so by disregarding the righteous principles of law and commit offenses against those who possess the power to inflict destruction.\n\nHere, Thiruvalluvar uses the act of committing crimes against powerful entities as a metaphor for self-destruction. The 'powerful' in this context could be interpreted as those who uphold the law or those who are in positions of authority. By choosing to act against them, one invites trouble, similar to poking a sleeping lion.\n\nMoreover, the verse also hints at the importance of respect for law and order. Ignorance or disregard of the law and its righteous dictates leads to chaos and ruin. It's a reminder that the rules and laws of a society or a system are put in place for the well-being of its members, and violating them would inevitably lead to harmful consequences.\n\nIn essence, the Kural warns against the reckless behavior of disregarding laws and principles, and acting against those who have the power to enforce them. The consequences of such actions are self-destruction and ruin. It highlights the importance of abiding by rules, respecting authority, and living a righteous life for one's own well-being and the harmony of society..The kural verse:கூற்றத்தைக் கையால் விளித்தற்றால் ஆற்றுவார்க்குஆற்றாதார் இன்னா செயல். ,translates to :The weak who insult men of might Death with their own hands invite,and it's explantion is :The Kural 894 underlines the folly of those who, despite their weakness, provoke or harm those who are stronger. It metaphorically likens this act to inviting Yama, the God of Death, thus indicating self-destruction. \n\nIn the cultural and philosophical context of ancient Tamil society, strength here is not merely physical strength, but also includes intellectual, moral, and financial prowess. Thus, the verse warns against the recklessness of crossing paths with those more powerful, not necessarily in brute force, but in wisdom, wealth, or influence. \n\nThis Kural, like many others, also carries a broader moral message. It encourages humility and respect towards those who are superior in certain aspects. It discourages the act of causing harm or undue trouble to others, especially when one is not capable of withstanding the potential repercussions. \n\nSo, the essence of this Kural is to act within one's capacity and not to invite trouble by foolishly challenging or harming those who are stronger. It advocates prudence, respect, and humility as key virtues in interpersonal relations..The kural verse:யாண்டுச்சென்று யாண்டும் உளராகார் வெந்துப்பின்வேந்து செறப்பட் டவர். ,translates to :Where can they go and thrive where Pursued by powerful monarch's ire?,and it's explantion is :Kural 895 addresses the power dynamics between a ruler and his subjects. The verse emphasizes the far-reaching influence and authority of a mighty and harsh ruler, suggesting that those who have fallen out of favor with such a potentate will face hardship and adversity no matter where they go.\n\nThe main theme of this verse is the pervasive power of authority. When the ruling authority is displeased, it can make life difficult for the individual, even if they try to escape by moving to different locations. This can be seen as a warning to avoid invoking the wrath of those in power, as their influence and ability to cause harm can extend beyond immediate surroundings.\n\nThe verse also points to the moral responsibility of rulers to exercise their power judiciously and compassionately. The use of the term \"cruel\" to describe the ruler suggests that the consequences faced by the subjects are unduly harsh, implying the ruler's misuse of power.\n\nOverall, this Kural verse serves as a reminder of the significance of maintaining a good rapport with those in power, the far-reaching consequences of their displeasure, and the importance of ethical leadership..The kural verse:எரியால் சுடப்படினும் உய்வுண்டாம் உய்யார்பெரியார்ப் பிழைத்தொழுகு வார். ,translates to :One can escape in fire caught The great who offends escapes not,and it's explantion is :This kural, verse 896, is a profound statement about respect and the consequences of disrespecting the wise and the noble.\n\nThe verse essentially says that if one is burnt by an actual fire, there is still a possibility that they might survive or live through it. However, if one disrespects or offends those who are great or noble in character, wisdom, or virtue, they will not be able to live peacefully. The 'burn' or 'injury' caused by this disrespect is far more severe and damaging than a physical burn, and it is not something one can easily recover from.\n\nThis verse emphasizes the importance of showing respect to those who are wiser and more virtuous than us. It suggests that disrespecting such individuals can lead to serious consequences, potentially even more severe than a physical injury. The 'great ones' referred to in this verse can be interpreted as those who are spiritually advanced, knowledgeable, or morally upright. Disrespecting them is seen as a grave mistake that can lead to suffering or hardship.\n\nIn terms of cultural context, respect for elders and wise individuals is a significant aspect of many Eastern cultures, including Tamil culture. This verse reflects that value and underscores the importance of maintaining respect and humility, even when interacting with those who are greater than us in some way.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse also serves as a moral lesson about the importance of humility, respect, and proper conduct in our interactions with others. To disrespect those who are wiser or more virtuous than us is not only a sign of arrogance but also a path to self-destruction..The kural verse:வகைமாண்ட வாழ்க்கையும் வான்பொருளும் என்னாம்தகைமாண்ட தக்கார் செறின். ,translates to :If holy mighty sages frown Stately gifts and stores who can own?,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 897, emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive relationship with righteous and virtuous individuals, particularly for those in positions of power such as kings. It warns that even with immense wealth and a prosperous reign, if a ruler manages to invoke the anger or disapproval of virtuous individuals, then the magnificence of his rule and all his material possessions may become meaningless.\n\nThe verse underscores the value of righteousness and virtue over material possessions and superficial power. It points out that the wrath of virtuous individuals can bring about the downfall of even the most powerful rulers. This is because, in Thiruvalluvar's worldview, moral righteousness and ethical conduct are the cornerstones of a well-functioning society. \n\nIn essence, the verse advises rulers and people in power to not only focus on accumulating wealth or living a life of luxury but also strive to act justly and earn the respect of virtuous individuals. It suggests that the approval of the righteous is a greater asset than all the wealth in the world. The message is not exclusive to rulers but extends to anyone, indicating that wealth and power are futile if one lacks moral integrity and respect from virtuous individuals..The kural verse:குன்றன்னார் குன்ற மதிப்பின் குடியொடுநின்றன்னார் மாய்வர் நிலத்து. ,translates to :When hill-like sages are held small The firm on earth lose home and all,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural, Kural 898, presents a profound truth about the power of will and the dynamics of karma. It is a warning to those who would attempt to undermine or challenge the integrity and strength of the wise and noble, likened here to a 'hill.'\n\nThe verse suggests that if anyone contemplates causing harm or destruction to those who are virtuous and strong in character (referred to as 'hill-like devotees'), they would face severe repercussions. Even if they appear to be well-established and prosperous in the world (the 'everlasting'), they would be uprooted and destroyed completely ('root and branch') from the earth.\n\nThe moral here is a note on the law of karma, which states that every action has consequences. If one tries to harm or belittle the virtuous and noble, it would ultimately lead to their own downfall. It is a reminder to respect the integrity and virtue of others, and to be cautious of our actions, as they inevitably come back to us in some form.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the verse uses the metaphor of a 'hill' for the wise and virtuous. This symbolizes their steadfastness, strength, and immovability, reflecting their strong moral character and deep-rooted values. \n\nIn summary, this verse teaches us the importance of respecting the virtuous, the consequences of ill-will, and the power of karma..The kural verse:ஏந்திய கொள்கையார் சீறின் இடைமுரிந்துவேந்தனும் வேந்து கெடும். ,translates to :Before the holy sage's rage Ev'n Indra's empire meets damage,and it's explantion is :Kural 899 sheds light on the consequences of the wrath of virtuous and highly principled individuals. It emphasizes that even the most powerful rulers can lose their rule and fall from their high status if they incur the anger of these people. \n\nThe verse underscores the value of maintaining respect and harmony with individuals who are guided by righteous values and principles. Despite the power and authority a king might wield, if he disregards or angers those who firmly adhere to virtue and righteousness, he may find his rule jeopardized. This is because such individuals, due to their principled nature, often command the respect and support of many, and their wrath may lead to widespread dissatisfaction and rebellion.\n\nThus, the Kural advises rulers and people in power to avoid actions that might provoke those who are virtuous and principled. It is a call to uphold justice, respect virtues, and maintain harmony for preserving one's power and status..The kural verse:இறந்தமைந்த சார்புடையர் ஆயினும் உய்யார்சிறந்தமைந்த சீரார் செறின். ,translates to :Even mighty aided men shall quail If the enraged holy seers will,and it's explantion is :Kural 900 elaborates on the power of virtue and the consequences faced by those who provoke virtuous individuals. It states that even if one has immense resources, wealth, or power, they cannot escape the consequences of offending those who are morally superior and whose virtue is limitless.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that the strength of virtue is not just in the righteousness it instills, but also in the protection it offers against wrongdoings. Those who are virtuous are often patient, but when pushed to their limits, their wrath could lead to the downfall of the offender, regardless of the latter's power or resources. This is a cautionary message to respect all, especially those superior in virtue, and not to underestimate the power of righteousness.\n\nThe cultural context here is the high value placed on moral excellence in Tamil society, as well as the belief in the spiritual power of righteousness that can counter even the most formidable material forces. The moral interpretation is clear: Respect and humility are necessary towards those who are virtuous, and arrogance, even backed by abundant resources, is self-destructive..The kural verse:மனைவிழைவார் மாண்பயன் எய்தார் வினைவிழையார்வேண்டாப் பொருளும் அது. ,translates to :Who dote on wives lose mighty gain That lust, dynamic men disdain,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 901, discusses the impact of excessive desire and the importance of maintaining a balanced relationship with one's spouse. It argues that those who are overly indulgent in their attraction towards their wives will not reach the heights of virtue. This is because their focus is diverted from their duties and responsibilities, which are the stepping stones to achieving virtue.\n\nThe verse further emphasizes that this overindulgence is undesirable for those who are committed to their deeds and actions with an aim to accumulate wealth. In this context, wealth does not just refer to material gain, but also the richness of character, knowledge, and virtue. This is because being excessively focused on personal desires can distract one from their goals and responsibilities, leading to an imbalance in life.\n\nIn essence, this verse promotes the idea of balance and focus in life. It urges individuals to not get swayed by excessive desires, but to maintain a balanced approach towards personal relationships and duties, as that will lead to virtue and true wealth. \n\nThe verse is a reflection of the teachings of the Thirukkural that promote self-control, harmony in relationships, and the pursuit of righteousness and virtue. It emphasizes that the path to prosperity and virtue lies in maintaining a balanced and disciplined life..The kural verse:பேணாது பெண்விழைவான் ஆக்கம் பெரியதோர்நாணாக நாணுத் தரும். ,translates to :Who dotes, unmanly, on his dame His wealth to him and all is shame,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse, Kural 902, discusses the negative consequences of a man being excessively devoted to his wife's feminine nature, disregarding his own masculinity or duties. \n\nIn this verse, Thiruvalluvar, the poet, emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balance in a marital relationship. He warns that a man who becomes excessively devoted or submissive to his wife's feminine charms, disregarding his own duties and responsibilities, will face humiliation and loss of respect. His wealth, gained as a result of such behaviour, will be a source of shame not only to himself but also to others.\n\nThis verse is not about demeaning women or their roles, but rather, it highlights the significance of personal responsibility and dignity in a relationship. It suggests that in a successful relationship, a man should not lose his self-respect or shirk his responsibilities, just as a woman should not. Both partners should command and give respect to each other, maintaining a harmonious balance.\n\nThiruvalluvar's wisdom in this verse is timeless, and it applies to contemporary society as well, where mutual respect, equality, and shared responsibilities form the bedrock of a healthy relationship..The kural verse:இல்லாள்கண் தாழ்ந்த இயல்பின்மை எஞ்ஞான்றும்நல்லாருள் நாணுத் தரும். ,translates to :Who's servile to his wife always Shy he feels before the wise,and it's explantion is :This couplet, Kural 903, speaks about the importance of maintaining respect and balance in a marital relationship. It suggests that a husband who continually submits to a wife without good virtues, in other words, who lets himself be dominated by an unvirtuous wife, will always feel a sense of shame in the presence of the virtuous people. \n\nThis verse is not about gender superiority or inferiority, but it emphasizes on the significance of virtues and righteousness in a person, regardless of their gender. In a broader perspective, the verse advocates for mutual respect and equality in a relationship, where neither party should stoop low or be submissive to the other. \n\nIt encourages individuals to stand up for what is right and virtuous, even if it means going against the wishes of a loved one. This can be seen as a call for moral courage in personal relationships. \n\nThe verse also highlights the societal perception of such relationships, where one party is dominated by the other, indicating that it will cause embarrassment in front of those who uphold virtues and good values. Hence, it encourages maintaining mutual respect and balance in relationships. \n\nIn essence, this Thiru Kural verse teaches us that we should not compromise our dignity and self-respect for the sake of pleasing others, even if the other person is our life partner. It encourages us to hold on to our principles and good virtues, which ultimately earns us respect among virtuous people..The kural verse:மனையாளை அஞ்சும் மறுமையி லாளன்வினையாண்மை வீறெய்த லின்று. ,translates to :Fearing his wife salvationless The weaklings' action has no grace,and it's explantion is :Kural 904 speaks about the importance of autonomy and confidence in one's actions, particularly in the context of a marital relationship. The verse suggests that if a man is always in fear of his wife and therefore refrains from taking any decisions or actions independently, his efforts will not be commended or respected. \n\nThis Kural does not promote the disregard of a spouse's opinions or feelings, but rather, it emphasizes the need for mutual respect and equal partnership in a relationship. A man who is continuously fearful of his wife's reactions or consequences will lack the assertiveness and confidence necessary to carry out his responsibilities effectively. This fear might result in indecisiveness and lack of initiative, which are not admirable qualities. \n\nTherefore, the verse encourages individuals to maintain their individuality and voice in a relationship while ensuring mutual respect and understanding. It is a call to avoid fear-driven decisions and actions, as they are unlikely to bring about any significant or commendable outcomes. Instead, one should strive for balance, respect, and open communication in a relationship, which will lead to more fulfilling and successful endeavours. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse also highlights the importance of courage and self-confidence in any undertaking. Fear and doubt can cripple one's abilities and potential, leading to mediocre or unsuccessful results. Thus, one should strive to overcome their fears and act with confidence and conviction..The kural verse:இல்லாளை அஞ்சுவான் அஞ்சுமற் றெஞ்ஞான்றும்நல்லார்க்கு நல்ல செயல். ,translates to :Who fears his wife fears always Good to do to the good and wise,and it's explantion is :Kural 905 explores the dynamics of fear and its impact on one's ability to perform good deeds. The verse suggests that a man who lives in fear of his wife will always be hesitant to do good deeds, even towards those who are virtuous. This is because the fear dominates his mind, making him apprehensive about the potential disapproval or backlash from his wife. Consequently, this fear inhibits his freedom and capacity to act upon his good intentions. It underscores the importance of courage and independence in making moral decisions and doing good deeds, without the influence of fear or apprehension. The verse also subtly suggests the necessity for mutual respect and understanding in a relationship, where one doesn't have to fear the other for their actions, especially when those actions are aimed at doing good..The kural verse:இமையாரின் வாழினும் பாடிலரே இல்லாள்அமையார்தோள் அஞ்சு பவர். ,translates to :Who fear douce arms of their wives Look petty even with god-like lives,and it's explantion is :The Kural 906 emphasizes the concept of self-respect and dignity in a relationship, particularly in the context of a man's relationship with his wife. It states that even if a man enjoys a high status or lives a life akin to the Gods, if he lives in fear or subservience to his wife, he loses his manliness or dignity.\n\nThe verse uses the metaphor of 'bamboo-like shoulders of wives' which could be interpreted as a symbol of strength and power. While the verse does not discourage respect or consideration towards one's spouse, it warns against the loss of self-respect and dignity by living in fear or undue subservience.\n\nIn a broader context, this verse promotes the idea of equality and mutual respect in a relationship, where neither partner should dominate the other or instill fear. It also emphasizes that external affluence or high status does not substitute for personal dignity and self-respect.\n\nThe verse serves as a reminder that a truly fulfilling and harmonious relationship is achieved not through dominance or submission, but through mutual respect, understanding, and shared responsibilities..The kural verse:பெண்ணேவல் செய்தொழுகும் ஆண்மையின் நாணுடைப்பெண்ணே பெருமை உடைத்து. ,translates to :Esteemed more is women bashful Than man servile unto her will,and it's explantion is :Kural 907 emphasizes the inherent dignity, grace, and strength of womanhood. It makes a comparison between a man who chooses to act like a woman out of cowardice or laziness, and a woman who maintains her grace, dignity, and a sense of shame or modesty, which was a highly esteemed virtue in ancient Tamil culture. \n\nThe Kural states that a woman who upholds her dignity and grace, despite her vulnerability and societal expectations, is far more commendable and honorable than a man who shirks his responsibilities and chooses to act in a manner that is not traditionally associated with manliness. \n\nThe underlying message of this verse is the importance of maintaining one's dignity, self-respect, and moral virtues, irrespective of one's gender. It's a subtle reminder that true strength and honor lie in one's character and conduct, not in one's physical strength or societal roles. It also emphasizes the importance of respecting womanhood and acknowledges the strength that lies in modesty and grace..The kural verse:நட்டார் குறைமுடியார் நன்றாற்றார் நன்னுதலாள்பெட் டாங்கு ஒழுகு பவர். ,translates to :By fair-browed wives who are governed Help no friends nor goodness tend,and it's explantion is :The verse or Kural 908 from Thirukkural penned by Thiruvalluvar asserts a critical observation about the balance required in relationships, particularly marital relationships. The Kural warns against the dangers of becoming excessively compliant or submissive to one's spouse, to the point that it interferes with one's broader responsibilities and duties.\n\nThe verse conveys that those who totally yield or surrender to the wishes and desires of their wives (or in a broader sense, their spouses) will neglect their duty towards their friends and the society. They will fail to address the needs of their friends or perform virtuous deeds that benefit society or humanity. \n\nThis Kural does not imply that one should ignore the desires or wishes of their spouse. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balance in relationships. It encourages individuals not to lose their sense of judgment or wisdom, and to not become so engrossed in personal relationships that they forget their responsibilities towards others and society at large.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, through this Kural, encourages a balanced approach to life where personal relationships do not overshadow social duties and moral obligations..The kural verse:அறவினையும் ஆன்ற பொருளும் பிறவினையும்பெண்ஏவல் செய்வார்கண் இல். ,translates to :No virtue riches nor joy is seen In those who submit to women,and it's explantion is :This Thirukkural verse emphasizes the importance of individual autonomy and decision-making in a man's life. It suggests that a man who always obeys the orders of his wife unquestioningly, without applying his own judgment or taking into account the larger implications, may not be able to conduct virtuous deeds, accumulate wealth or even experience true pleasure.\n\nThe verse underscores the idea that unquestioning obedience, particularly in a marital relationship, can lead to a lack of personal growth and self-development. It does not belittle the role of a wife or suggest that her views are unimportant; rather, it points out the potential pitfalls of blind obedience. \n\nIn a broader context, this principle can be applied to any relationship or situation where one person is completely dominated by another's opinions or decisions without giving room for their own discretion and judgment. To lead a balanced life, one must use their own wisdom and understanding, along with considering the views of others. \n\nIt's also important to note that Thirukkural, being a text from ancient times, reflects the societal norms of its era. Today's interpretation can be more inclusive and promote a balanced partnership where both parties contribute to decisions and respect each other's views..The kural verse:எண்சேர்ந்த நெஞ்சத் திடனுடையார்க்கு எஞ்ஞான்றும்பெண்சேர்ந்தாம் பேதைமை இல். ,translates to :Thinkers strong and broad of heart By folly on fair sex do not dote,and it's explantion is :The Kural 910 discusses the importance of having a discerning and thoughtful mind, especially in the context of a marital relationship. It suggests that individuals who possess clarity of thought, emotional stability, and financial prosperity will not fall into the trap of blind devotion, which can lead to irrational decisions and actions. \n\nThis verse cautions against the consequences of allowing one's love and devotion towards their spouse to overpower their judgment. While love and care are essential elements of a healthy relationship, blind devotion can potentially lead to foolishness and irrationality. This does not mean that one should not love or respect their spouse, but rather, it encourages maintaining a balance and not allowing emotions to cloud one's reasoning.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse emphasizes the importance of rational thinking and mindfulness in all aspects of life. It encourages individuals to maintain their sense of self and personal judgment despite being in love or in a relationship. \n\nIn simple terms, those with a clear mind and sound judgment will not act foolishly, even when they are deeply devoted to their spouse. They understand the importance of maintaining their individuality and rationality in any situation..The kural verse:அன்பின் விழையார் பொருள்விழையும் ஆய்தொடியார்இன்சொல் இழுக்குத் தரும். ,translates to :For gold, not love their tongue cajoles Men are ruined by bangled belles,and it's explantion is :The Kural 911 warns against the deceptive allure of those who express affection or love based on materialistic desires rather than genuine affection. It specifically speaks of women who use their charm to entice men, not out of love but driven by avarice or greed.\n\nThese women, adorned with bracelets - a metaphorical representation of their profession, may use sweet words and false affection to attract men. However, the verse warns that such attraction is not rooted in genuine emotion but is based purely on materialistic desires. As such, the sweetness of their words is ephemeral and can cause profound sorrow and disappointment when the truth of their intentions becomes apparent.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of deception and the importance of discerning genuine affection from deceit. It highlights the potential harm that can come from pursuing relationships based on materialistic desires rather than genuine love and affection. \n\nUltimately, Thiruvalluvar advises us to be cautious and discerning in our relationships, and to understand that genuine affection cannot be bought or traded for material gain..The kural verse:பயன்தூக்கிப் பண்புரைக்கும் பண்பின் மகளிர்நயன்தூக்கி நள்ளா விடல். ,translates to :Avoid ill-natured whores who feign Love only for their selfish gain,and it's explantion is :Thiru Kural 912 warns against the deceitfulness of ill-natured women who might appear to be well-mannered and good-natured, only for the sake of obtaining personal gains. These women assess the wealth and resources of a man and pretend to be of good character to exploit him. \n\nThe Kural advises men to be cautious and discerning. It suggests they should carefully examine the character and intentions of such women before getting involved with them. Such relationships, based on deception and self-interest, should be avoided, as they could lead to harm and exploitation.\n\nThis verse also implicitly emphasizes the importance of true character and sincerity in relationships. It suggests a need for awareness and wisdom to differentiate between genuine affection and deceptive behavior. It instructs us to value honesty and authenticity over superficial charm and deceit..The kural verse:பொருட்பெண்டிர் பொய்ம்மை முயக்கம் இருட்டறையில்ஏத஧ல் பிணந்தழீஇ அற்று. ,translates to :The false embrace of whores is like That of a damned corpse in the dark,and it's explantion is :Kural 913 explores the deceptive nature of materialistic love. The verse metaphorically compares the affection shown by women who are only interested in wealth to the act of embracing a strange corpse in a dark room. \n\nThe analogy of a dark room represents the absence of genuine understanding and real affection. The corpse signifies something lifeless and devoid of true emotions, similar to the love expressed by those who are driven by materialism. \n\nJust as one would feel revulsion and realize the truth upon discovering they were embracing a corpse, one would experience similar feelings upon realizing that the affection they received was solely based on their wealth.\n\nThis verse serves as a cautionary tale against the illusion created by materialistic love and highlights the importance of genuine affection in relationships. It emphasizes that love should be based on mutual respect, understanding, and emotional connection rather than material possessions..The kural verse:பொருட்பொருளார் புன்னலந் தோயார் அருட்பொருள்ஆயும் அறிவி னவர். ,translates to :The wise who seek the wealth of grace Look not for harlots' low embrace,and it's explantion is :Kural 914 delves into the realm of morals and values, emphasizing the importance of virtue over materialistic gains. The verse suggests that those who are truly wise will seek the wealth of grace, or spiritual richness, rather than the superficial favours of those who value material wealth above all else. \n\nThe \"wealth of grace\" can be interpreted as kindness, compassion, wisdom, and other virtues that enrich the soul and contribute to a more fulfilling life. On the other hand, \"base favours of those who regard wealth as riches\" refers to the shallow pleasures or gains derived from those who are solely focused on accumulating material wealth, often at the expense of moral values.\n\nThe verse is a critique of materialism and a call for spiritual and moral enrichment. It suggests that material possessions or wealth cannot bring true satisfaction or happiness, as they are transient and can lead to moral degradation. It encourages individuals to focus on attaining spiritual wealth, which is eternal and truly fulfilling.\n\nIn essence, Kural 914 emphasizes the importance of spiritual wealth over material wealth. It speaks to the need to prioritize moral and spiritual growth, which leads to true fulfillment, over the pursuit of transient and potentially corrupting material wealth..The kural verse:பொதுநலத்தார் புன்னலம் தோயார் மதிநலத்தின்மாண்ட அறிவி னவர். ,translates to :The lofty wise will never covet The open charms of a vile harlot,and it's explantion is :Kural 915 emphasizes the discernment that comes from a combination of innate wisdom and learned knowledge. This verse suggests that those who possess knowledge, refined and enhanced by their natural intelligence, will not indulge in fleeting pleasures.\n\nThe verse implies a certain level of self-control and moral integrity. It suggests that those with true knowledge understand the transient nature of sensual pleasures and choose not to pursue them. They are not easily swayed by the superficial allure of these pleasures, as their understanding and wisdom allow them to see beyond the momentary joy they might bring.\n\nThis verse also illustrates the virtue of self-restraint and the importance of discernment in making choices that align with one's long-term well-being and moral values. It underscores the idea that true knowledge is not just about accumulating information, but also about possessing the wisdom to use it judiciously.\n\nThe Tamil explanations provided further illustrate the point that those with deep wisdom and understanding will not desire the perishable pleasures offered by common women. They understand that such pleasures are temporary and could lead to undesirable consequences, hence they display self-control and maintain their moral integrity..The kural verse:தந்நலம் பாரிப்பார் தோயார் தகைசெருக்கிப்புன்னலம் பாரிப்பார் தோள். ,translates to :Those who guard their worthy fame Shun the wanton's vaunting charm,and it's explantion is :Kural 916 emphasizes the dignity and self-respect of virtuous individuals. It highlights that those who wish to be known for their own goodness and moral excellence would not seek the support of those who take pride in their own vanity and sell their favors to anyone willing to pay. \n\nThis verse draws a contrast between two types of individuals. On one hand, there are those who maintain their dignity by relying on their virtues and strive to spread their fame through their good deeds. On the other hand, there are those who rejoice in their own superficial accomplishments and offer their favors indiscriminately for material gain, disregarding their self-respect.\n\nThe virtuous individuals, according to this Kural, maintain a distance from such people, as they believe in earning their fame and respect through their own good deeds and moral excellence, rather than depending on the support of those who compromise their dignity for materialistic pleasures.\n\nTherefore, Kural 916 teaches the importance of self-reliance, dignity, and the value of moral excellence. It discourages seeking support or favors from those who lack these virtues, even if they might seem to offer a quick path to fame or success. The Kural suggests that such shortcuts often come at the cost of one's self-respect and dignity..The kural verse:நிறைநெஞ்சம் இல்லவர் தோய்வார் பிறநெஞ்சிற்பேணிப் புணர்பவர் தோள். ,translates to :Hollow hearts alone desire The arms of whores with hearts elsewere,and it's explantion is :Kural 917 explores the idea of insincere affection and uncontrolled desire. It states that those who lack a well-composed mind, or in other words, lack self-control and genuine affection, would be tempted to desire physical intimacy from women who offer it, even when their hearts covet other things. This temptation occurs despite the fact that these women might be offering their affections purely out of their own self-interest or the pursuit of personal gain.\n\nThe verse advises caution against falling into such insincere relationships and warns of the destructive power of uncontrolled desire. It highlights the importance of genuine affection, self-control, and moral integrity in relationships. The verse also implies that a well-composed mind is capable of discerning insincere affection, thereby protecting oneself from potential harm.\n\nThe cultural context of this verse is grounded in the ancient Tamil societal norms, where moral integrity and self-control were highly valued, particularly in the context of relationships. It serves as a timeless reminder of the importance of these values in maintaining healthy and sincere relationships..The kural verse:ஆயும் அறிவினர் அல்லார்க்கு அணங்கென்பமாய மகளிர் முயக்கு. ,translates to :Senseless fools are lured away By arms of sirens who lead astray,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural, written by the ancient Tamil philosopher Thiruvalluvar, holds a cautionary message about the dangers of succumbing to the allure of unfaithful women, especially for those who lack discernment or wisdom.\n\nThe verse uses the analogy of a celestial female (often portrayed in ancient mythologies as enchanting but destructive beings) to describe the ravaging effect that an unfaithful woman can have on a man who lacks discernment. It suggests that just as one can be ensnared and ruined by the charm of these mythological beings, so too can a man be led astray and harmed by a faithless woman if he lacks the wisdom to see through her deceit.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of discernment, the ability to judge well. It suggests that wisdom shields one from being fooled by appearances and helps in making choices that lead to well-being and happiness, rather than harm and ruin.\n\nThis message is universal and timeless, warning against the dangers of being enticed by illusions and deceit, whether in human relationships or other areas of life. It advocates for wisdom, discernment, and moral integrity as vital qualities that can protect individuals from such perils. \n\nTherefore, this Kural advocates the cultivation of wisdom and discernment as a shield against deception and self-destruction. It encourages one to see beyond superficial allure and make judicious choices in life..The kural verse:வரைவிலா மாணிழையார் மென்தோள் புரையிலாப்பூரியர்கள் ஆழும் அளறு. ,translates to :The soft jewelled arms of whores are hell Into which the degraded fall,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse, Kural 919, offers a socio-moral commentary on the consequences of indulging in illicit relationships with women who sell their affection for money, often referred to as prostitutes. The verse metaphorically describes the delicate, jewel-adorned shoulders of these women as a perilous pit or hell where the morally weak and ignorant individuals fall into.\n\nThe verse underscores the dangers of being seduced by the physical allure of such women, which is symbolized by the 'delicate shoulders' and 'excellent jewels'. These symbols are used to represent the external beauty and materialistic allure that can be deceptive and destructive for those who lack discernment and moral strength. \n\nThe verse warns that those who succumb to such temptations, typically the morally weak and ignorant, end up in a metaphorical hell, signifying a state of moral degradation, societal disapproval, and potential self-destruction. The 'hell' here could be interpreted as a life riddled with guilt, shame, and regret, or it could also refer to societal consequences such as ostracization, ruin, and loss of reputation.\n\nIn essence, this verse serves as a moral caution against indulging in immoral relationships, emphasizing the importance of self-control, moral strength, and discernment in avoiding the pitfalls of transient physical allure and materialistic temptations..The kural verse:இருமனப் பெண்டிரும் கள்ளும் கவறும்திருநீக்கப் பட்டார் தொடர்பு. ,translates to :Double-minded whores, wine and dice Are lures of those whom fortune flies,and it's explantion is :Kural 920 is a stern warning against some of the major vices that can lead to ruin and loss of dignity in life. The verse refers to treacherous women, alcohol (liquor), and gambling. These are described as the associates of those who have been abandoned by fortune, meaning those who have strayed from the path of righteousness and wisdom.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the destructive nature of these vices. 'Treacherous women' refers to being involved in immoral relationships, which can lead to disruption in personal and social life. 'Liquor' signifies the addiction to alcohol, which can cause physical and mental harm, and impair judgment and control. 'Gambling' is highlighted as a dangerous habit leading to financial ruin and loss of integrity.\n\nThe verse asserts that those who engage in these activities are those who have been forsaken by fortune, implying that these vices lead to a life devoid of respect, prosperity, and peace. In a broader sense, these vices represent any forms of unethical behavior and addiction that might lead one away from a virtuous and prosperous life.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, through this Kural, advises people to abstain from unethical relationships, alcoholism, and gambling, as they are destructive and lead to the downfall of individuals. The verse stands as a moral reminder of the importance of righteous conduct for a life of dignity, prosperity, and peace..The kural verse:உட்கப் படாஅர் ஒளியிழப்பர் எஞ்ஞான்றும்கட்காதல் கொண்டொழுகு வார். ,translates to :Foes fear not who for toddy craze The addicts daily their glory lose,and it's explantion is :Kural 921 speaks about the negative consequences of excessive drinking. The verse highlights that those who incessantly indulge in alcohol not only lose their reputation but also fail to instill fear or garner respect from others. \n\nIn the cultural context of Thiruvalluvar's time, inspiring fear was often equated with wielding power or authority. Here, the fear does not denote terror, but rather respect and reverence due to one's position, capability, or character. When one is constantly under the influence of alcohol, they lose their rational judgment and ability to make wise decisions, thereby losing the respect of their peers and subordinates.\n\nThe \"light of their fame\" refers to the reputation and respect one has earned through their achievements or character. Excessive drinking tarnishes this light, leading to a loss of social prestige and respect. It implies that one's actions, especially when under the influence, can have a significant impact on their public image. \n\nThe moral interpretation of this verse is a warning against the perils of alcohol addiction. It serves as a reminder that such a habit not only affects one's personal life but also their social standing and the respect they command in society. It encourages self-control and moderation, highlighting the importance of maintaining one's dignity and reputation..The kural verse:உண்ணற்க கள்ளை உணில்உண்க சான்றோரான்எண்ணப் படவேண்டா தார். ,translates to :Drink not liquor; but let them drink Whom with esteem the wise won't think,and it's explantion is :The verse 922 from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of maintaining one's reputation and respect in society, and warns against the consumption of intoxicating substances like alcohol that can tarnish one's esteem.\n\nThe verse states, \"Let no liquor be drunk; if it is desired, let it be drunk by those who care not for esteem of the great\". This is a strong assertion advising against the consumption of alcohol, indicating that it can lead to a loss of reputation among the virtuous and esteemed individuals in society. \n\nThe verse suggests that only those who do not care for their social standing and the respect of virtuous people may resort to alcohol consumption if they so desire. This can be interpreted as a caution against the potential social and moral pitfalls of intoxication, including a loss of self-control, degradation of one's character, and a decrease in societal respect.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can be seen as an advice to avoid any behavior that may negatively impact one's position in society and the respect one commands among virtuous individuals. It advocates for self-discipline, moral integrity, and respect for societal norms and values..The kural verse:ஈன்றாள் முகத்தேயும் இன்னாதால் என்மற்றுச்சான்றோர் முகத்துக் களி. ,translates to :The drunkard's joy pains ev'n mother's face How vile must it look for the wise?,and it's explantion is :Kural 923 deals with the theme of intoxication and its social implications. It emphasizes the disgrace and discomfort felt when one is intoxicated, particularly in front of those who hold significant roles in their life like their mother and the wise. \n\nThe verse begins by saying that getting intoxicated in the presence of one's mother is painful. This is because a mother, who is typically the first teacher and moral guide in a person's life, would be hurt and disappointed by such behavior. Her pain would inevitably reflect upon the individual, making the intoxication a source of distress rather than pleasure.\n\nThe second half of the verse extends this situation to the presence of the wise, who are individuals respected and admired for their wisdom and virtuous conduct. If intoxication is painful in front of one's mother, then it would be even more so in front of these wise individuals whose opinion and respect one might value. \n\nThe verse underscores the negative social consequences of intoxication, particularly the discomfort and shame it can bring in front of respected figures. It encourages individuals to consider these social implications before giving in to such habits, thereby promoting a sense of self-control, respect for others, and social responsibility..The kural verse:நாண்என்னும் நல்லாள் புறங்கொடுக்கும் கள்ளென்னும்பேணாப் பெருங்குற்றத் தார்க்கு. ,translates to :Good shame turns back from him ashamed Who is guilty of wine condemned,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse 924 speaks about the negative impacts of drunkenness or excessive use of intoxicating substances. It portrays personified modesty as a fair maiden, who would turn her back on those indulging in the deplorable act of excessive drinking. \n\nThe verse uses the metaphor of a fair maiden to represent the virtue of modesty, suggesting that modesty is beautiful, dignified, and commands respect. On the contrary, drunkenness is depicted as a great and abominable crime. The imagery of the fair maiden turning her back on those who commit this crime signifies the idea that modesty and decorum cannot coexist with indulgence in intoxication. \n\nIn other words, people who engage in excessive drinking lose their dignity, respect, and decorum, represented here by the departure of the 'fair maiden of modesty'. Therefore, the verse urges individuals to abstain from excessive drinking to maintain their modesty and dignity. \n\nIn cultural context, Thiruvalluvar, the author of Thiru Kural, emphasizes the importance of modesty and self-restraint in one's life. He condemns drunkenness as it impairs one's judgement, leads to inappropriate behavior, and ultimately results in the loss of modesty and respect..The kural verse:கையறி யாமை உடைத்தே பொருள்கொடுத்துமெய்யறி யாமை கொளல். ,translates to :To pay and drink and lose the sense Is nothing but rank ignorance,and it's explantion is :Kural 925 explores the idea of self-destruction through substance abuse, particularly the use of intoxicants. In essence, it criticizes the act of spending one's resources to purchase substances that lead to a state of unconsciousness or ignorance.\n\nThe verse metaphorically suggests that indulging in intoxicants is akin to buying one's own ignorance and oblivion. It is a critique of how individuals willingly pay for substances that blur their consciousness, leading them away from their true selves and reality. \n\nThe kural underscores the moral and ethical implications of such behavior. It points to the absurdity of the act of trading money (which could otherwise be used for useful or constructive purposes) for a temporary escape from reality, which ultimately harms the individual both physically and mentally.\n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse can also be seen as a commentary on the value of self-awareness and the dangers of escapism. It underlines the importance of maintaining one's consciousness and awareness intact, emphasizing that any action leading to the loss of self-awareness is a form of self-destruction. It encourages individuals to stay true to their own selves and not lose their identity or consciousness for temporary pleasure or escape..The kural verse:துஞ்சினார் செத்தாரின் வேறல்லர் எஞ்ஞான்றும்நஞ்சுண்பார் கள்ளுண் பவர். ,translates to :They take poison who take toddy And doze ev'n like a dead body,and it's explantion is :Kural 926 discusses the detrimental impacts of sleep and intoxication, drawing a parallel between them and death and poison consumption respectively. \n\nThe verse states that those who sleep excessively are no different from the dead, for both are inactive and unresponsive to the world around them. The comparison is drawn to emphasize the importance of active participation in life and to discourage lethargy and inaction. \n\nSimilarly, the verse likens those who indulge in intoxication to those who consume poison. This comparison is used to highlight the damaging effects of alcohol and other intoxicants on one's physical health and mental acuity. Just as poison is harmful and potentially lethal, overindulgence in intoxicants can lead to detrimental consequences, including impaired judgement, health problems, and social issues. \n\nIn essence, this verse encourages individuals to lead an active, alert, and sober life. It advocates for the moderation of sleep and the avoidance of intoxication, emphasizing the importance of maintaining physical health and mental clarity for a prosperous and fulfilling life..The kural verse:உள்ளொற்றி உள்ளூர் நகப்படுவர் எஞ்ஞான்றும்கள்ளொற்றிக் கண்சாய் பவர் ,translates to :The secret drunkards' senses off Make the prying public laugh,and it's explantion is :The Kural 927 emphasizes the negative impacts of secret indulgence in intoxicating substances, particularly alcohol. It suggests that those who secretly consume alcohol, attempting to hide their habits, will eventually be discovered, and their secrets will become a source of laughter and ridicule for their fellow townsmen.\n\nThe verse is a commentary on the deceptive nature of secret indulgences. It highlights that no matter how discreet one might be, the effects of intoxication are often visibly apparent and hard to conceal, especially in the form of altered behavior, slurred speech, and unstable movements. Therefore, such individuals end up exposing their secrets themselves.\n\nFurthermore, this verse serves as a warning against the social consequences of such behavior. The derision from the community can lead to a loss of respect and credibility for the individual involved. Thus, Thiruvalluvar implores the readers to maintain good moral conduct and avoid habits that can lead to such disgrace.\n\nIn a broader sense, the verse also speaks against any form of deceit or hypocrisy. It suggests that truth eventually comes out, leading to the embarrassment of the individuals who tried to hide it. Therefore, it advocates for honesty, transparency, and leading a life of integrity..The kural verse:களித்தறியேன் என்பது கைவிடுக நெஞ்சத்துஒளித்ததூஉம் ஆங்கே மிகும். ,translates to :Don't say I'm not a drunkard hard The hidden fraud is known abroad,and it's explantion is :Kural 928 is a striking commentary on the effects of intoxication, particularly in relation to the pretense of not having indulged in drinking. Thiruvalluvar, the author, advises individuals who indulge in intoxication to stop pretending that they have never tasted alcohol, as their behavior while under its influence will inevitably reveal the truth.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the futility of deceit or denial about one's habits, especially those considered socially unacceptable or morally questionable. When someone gets intoxicated, their actions, speech, and demeanor change noticeably, often revealing the truth about their indulgence. This unveiling of truth happens despite their previous attempts to hide or deny their drinking habit.\n\nMoreover, the kural suggests that the deceit within oneself is not sustainable. It's not just about the social exposure but also about the internal conflict and self-deception that one goes through. It alludes to the moral aspect that truth cannot be hidden or suppressed and it finds its way out, especially when one's inhibitions are lowered, such as during intoxication.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can be seen as a general critique of hypocrisy and deceit. It underscores the value of honesty and transparency, urging individuals to be true to themselves and others, instead of hiding behind a facade of falsehood..The kural verse:களித்தானைக் காரணம் காட்டுதல் கீழ்நீர்க்குளித்தானைத் தீத்துரீஇ அற்று. ,translates to :Can torch search one in water sunk?  Can reason reach the raving drunk?,and it's explantion is :The given Thiru Kural verse 929 is a reflection on the futility of reasoning with a chronic alcoholic. It likens the effort to an impossible task – like trying to find a drowned man underwater by using a torch. \n\nAlcohol, when consumed excessively, impairs one's judgement and reasoning abilities, rendering them incapable of understanding logic or wisdom. This is why Thiruvalluvar, the author of Thiru Kural, compares trying to reason with an intoxicated person to attempting to illuminate the depths of water with a torch - the torch will not work underwater, and the drowned man is beyond saving. \n\nThe broader message here is not just about alcoholism, but about the difficulty in trying to reason with anyone who is deeply entrenched in harmful habits or behaviors. Such efforts are often futile because the individual is not in a state to understand or accept the advice given to them. \n\nTherefore, this verse presents a profound insight into human nature and the challenges of behavior change, emphasizing the importance of personal willingness and understanding in the process of self-improvement..The kural verse:கள்ளுண்ணாப் போழ்திற் களித்தானைக் காணுங்கால்உள்ளான்கொல் உண்டதன் சோர்வு. ,translates to :The sober seeing the drunkard's plight On selves can't they feel same effect?,and it's explantion is :The Kural 930 reflects on the perspective of a person observing the harmful effects of intoxication on another, while they themselves are sober. The verse states that when a person who is not currently under the influence of alcohol sees another person intoxicated, it seems as if they fail to remember the negative effects of their own past drinking experiences. \n\nThe verse underscores the tendency of human beings to overlook or forget the adverse consequences of their actions when they are not immediately experiencing them. The intoxicated person serves as a mirror, reflecting the potential harm and embarrassment that can result from excessive drinking. Yet, the sober person, in this moment, fails to recognize and remember their own similar past experiences, indicating a lack of self-awareness and reflection.\n\nThis Kural is a moral admonition, cautioning against the dangers of alcohol abuse and the lack of self-reflection. It stresses the importance of learning from our past experiences and those of others, and not repeating harmful behaviors. The verse also implicitly suggests the value of sobriety and the need to maintain a clear, conscious mind.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can be seen as a metaphor for any harmful habit or behavior. It warns against forgetting the negative consequences of our actions when we are not directly affected by them, and the importance of understanding and remembering these consequences to prevent repeating the same mistakes..The kural verse:வேண்டற்க வென்றிடினும் சூதினை வென்றதூஉம்தூண்டிற்பொன் மீன்விழுங்கி அற்று. ,translates to :Avoid gambling, albeit you win Gulping bait-hook what does fish gain?,and it's explantion is :Kural 931 is a cautionary verse against the allure of gambling. It warns that even if one possesses the ability to succeed in gambling, one should not desire or pursue it. The underlying reason is that the gains from gambling are not genuine or lasting, similar to how a fish is ultimately harmed when it swallows a baited hook, mistaking it for food.\n\nIn the fish analogy, the fish sees the bait on the hook as a source of sustenance, but in reality, it leads to its doom. Similarly, winning in gambling seems attractive and rewarding, but it often leads to harmful consequences in the long run, such as addiction, financial ruin, and social disgrace.\n\nThe moral lesson here is to avoid the temptation of easy gains, as they often come with hidden dangers and negative repercussions. This verse encourages us to strive for honest and hard-earned success rather than quick and risky profits..The kural verse:ஒன்றெய்தி நூறிழக்கும் சூதர்க்கும் உண்டாங்கொல்நன்றெய்தி வாழ்வதோர் ஆறு. ,translates to :Can gamblers in life good obtain Who lose a hundred one to gain?,and it's explantion is :This Kural, number 932, is a profound critique on the practice of gambling. It underscores the futility of seeking lasting happiness and prosperity through such an uncertain and risky pursuit. \n\nThe verse metaphorically refers to gamblers as those who win one and yet lose a hundred, implying that the losses in gambling far outweigh the gains. It questions if there is indeed any way for gamblers to attain true happiness and a prosperous life. The odds are heavily stacked against them, as they continually risk much more than they can possibly gain. \n\nEssentially, the verse highlights the inherent instability and peril of gambling, which is unlikely to lead to a sustainable and contented life. It underscores the moral principle that true happiness and prosperity cannot be achieved through risky, short-term gains, but through hard work, honesty, and integrity. \n\nThus, the Kural serves as a warning against the allure of quick fortunes through gambling, emphasizing instead the value of stable, honest means of livelihood for a good and prosperous life..The kural verse:உருளாயம் ஓவாது கூறின் பொருளாயம்போஒய்ப் புறமே படும். ,translates to :If kings indulge in casting dice All their fortune will flow to foes,and it's explantion is :The Kural 933 addresses the perils of excessive gambling and its detrimental effects. The verse uses the metaphor of a king addicted to dice to represent any individual indulging in uncontrolled gambling.\n\nThe king is symbolic of a person in power or authority, or simply an individual. The rolling dice is a metaphor for gambling or any high-risk venture embarked upon with the hope of easy gain. The verse warns that if a person is endlessly engrossed in such risky ventures, hoping to amass wealth, it could lead to their downfall. Instead of increasing their wealth, they stand to lose it all, with their resources ending up in the hands of others.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse advises against overindulgence in any activity that promises quick gains but involves high risks, such as gambling. It underscores the importance of responsible and wise decision-making, especially when it comes to matters of wealth and resources.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that unsustainable and reckless practices, like uncontrolled gambling, can lead to the loss of not just existing wealth, but also the means to generate future wealth. This is a timeless lesson relevant to individuals and societies across ages and cultures. \n\nIn a nutshell, Kural 933 serves as a cautionary note against the perils of excessive gambling, reminding us of the wisdom in responsible and prudent management of resources..The kural verse:சிறுமை பலசெய்து சீரழக்கும் சூதின்வறுமை தருவதொன்று இல். ,translates to :Nothing will make you poor like game Which adds to woes and ruins fame,and it's explantion is :Kural 934 explores the destructive impact of gambling, emphasizing its capacity to yield extensive hardships, tarnish one's reputation, and plunge one into poverty. The verse underscores the fact that there is no other behavior as detrimental as gambling, which can multiply one's troubles, erode dignity, and lead to financial ruin.\n\nGambling, as portrayed in this verse, is indicative of reckless behaviors that prioritize immediate gratification over long-term stability and well-being. The verse serves as a warning against such behavior, highlighting its negative consequences that extend beyond the individual to affect their social standing and relationships. \n\nThis Kural reflects a universal truth that is relevant across cultures and eras, cautioning individuals to exercise self-control, avoid harmful indulgences, and pursue activities that contribute to personal growth and societal well-being. In essence, it reminds us of the importance of responsible behavior for maintaining personal integrity and financial stability..The kural verse:கவறும் கழகமும் கையும் தருக்கிஇவறியார் இல்லாகி யார். ,translates to :The game, game-hall and gambler's art Who sought with glee have come to nought,and it's explantion is :This Thirukkural verse, 935, is a profound message against the pitfalls of gambling. \n\nThe verse essentially states that those who are deeply attached to gambling, the gambling place, and the act of gambling (here represented by the handling of dice), will eventually find themselves penniless. The verse highlights the destructive nature of gambling and warns against the serious consequences of becoming engrossed in such activities. \n\nThe three things mentioned in this verse - gambling, the gambling place, and the act of gambling - are symbols of the overall addiction to gambling. They represent the allure, the environment, and the act itself, all of which can be highly addictive and lead to financial ruin.\n\nTherefore, this verse serves as a cautionary note against the dangers of gambling. It implies that those who are unable to let go of their attachment to gambling will end up losing everything they possess. It underscores the important life lesson that unhealthy attachments and addictions can lead to disastrous outcomes.\n\nIn a broader context, this verse can also be interpreted as a warning against the dangers of any form of addiction or unhealthy obsession, as they can lead to negative consequences and a deterioration of one's life and resources..The kural verse:அகடாரார் அல்லல் உழப்பர்சூ தென்னும்முகடியான் மூடப்பட் டார். ,translates to :Men swallowed by the ogress, dice Suffer grief and want by that vice,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural talks about the devastating consequences of gambling. The verse metaphorically describes gambling as a goddess who lures and swallows people into her trap. The individuals who fall prey to her are doomed to suffer hunger and relentless pain.\n\nThe verse brings attention to the unsatisfied hunger of gamblers. This could be interpreted both literally and figuratively. Literally, it can be seen as the lack of resources to support basic needs like food due to financial loss. Figuratively, the hunger could symbolize the insatiable desire to gamble more, hoping to win back what was lost, but the cycle only pulls them deeper into misery.\n\nThe verse also alludes to the suffering in the afterlife, describing it as experiencing the pangs of hell. This can be seen as a moral warning of the spiritual consequences due to the unethical means often adopted in gambling.\n\nIn a nutshell, this verse is a potent caution against the perils of gambling, emphasizing its power to induce physical deprivation, insatiable desire and spiritual suffering. It encourages individuals to avoid such destructive habits which can lead to personal ruin and spiritual degradation..The kural verse:பழகிய செல்வமும் பண்பும் கெடுக்கும்கழகத்துக் காலை புகின். ,translates to :If men their time in game-den spend Ancestral wealth and virtues end,and it's explantion is :This Kural, number 937, offers a strong warning about the dangers of gambling and wasting time in such activities. It states that if a person spends their time in a gambling house, it will not only deplete their inherited wealth but also corrode their inherent good character. \n\nThe reference to \"inherited wealth\" implies the financial resources passed down from previous generations. It's a reminder that wealth is not just a personal possession, but also a responsibility. Squandering it on gambling shows disrespect towards the hard work and sacrifices made by our ancestors. \n\nThe verse also mentions \"goodness of character\" to highlight the moral and ethical deterioration that can occur due to habitual gambling. It's not just about losing money but also about losing one's integrity, self-respect, and reputation. \n\nIn essence, the verse is a strong moral and ethical caution against the perils of gambling and the destructive consequences it can have on one's wealth and character. It encourages responsible stewardship of inherited wealth and preservation of personal integrity..The kural verse:பொருள்கெடுத்துப் பொய்மேற் கொளீஇ அருள்கெடுத்துஅல்லல் உழப்பிக்கும் சூது. ,translates to :Game ruins wealth and spoils grace Leads to lies and wretched woes,and it's explantion is :Kural 938 addresses the detrimental effects of gambling. It is stated that gambling not only impairs one's financial stability but also corrupts their morality. \n\nThe first line, \"பொருள்கெடுத்துப் பொய்மேற் கொளீஇ\" translates to \"Gambling destroys property and teaches falsehood\". This highlights how gambling can lead a person to financial ruin. It also suggests that gambling often involves deceit and dishonesty, which furthers the individual's moral degradation.\n\nThe second line, \"அருள்கெடுத்து அல்லல் உழப்பிக்கும் சூது\" translates to \"it puts an end to benevolence and brings in misery\". This suggests that the gambler becomes self-centered, losing their sense of empathy and kindness towards others. Furthermore, the involvement in gambling brings about distress and sorrow, both in the present life and potentially in the afterlife.\n\nIn conclusion, this verse from Thiru Kural warns against the harmful effects of gambling, emphasizing its potential to cause financial, moral, and emotional ruin. It encourages individuals to abstain from such activities for their own well-being and for the well-being of society at large..The kural verse:உடைசெல்வம் ஊண்ஒளி கல்விஎன்று ஐந்தும்அடையாவாம் ஆயங் கொளின். ,translates to :Dress, wealth, food, fame, learning-these five In gambler's hand will never thrive,and it's explantion is :Kural 939 is a poignant caution against the perils of gambling. Here, Thiruvalluvar, the author, lists out five essential aspects of life that one stands to lose due to the habit of gambling - clothing, wealth, food, fame, and learning.\n\nClothing, wealth, and food are the basic needs of human life, and gambling, with its addictive and destructive nature, often leads to the loss of these necessities. The gambler, in his quest for quick and easy money, may end up losing all his material possessions, leaving him destitute.\n\nFame refers to one's reputation and social standing. A person addicted to gambling, over time, loses respect in society. The habit is generally seen as irresponsible and reckless, negatively impacting the individual's social image.\n\nLastly, the verse talks about the loss of learning. This can be interpreted in two ways. Firstly, an individual engrossed in gambling may neglect his education or intellectual growth. Secondly, the wisdom or life lessons that one gains over the course of life may also be lost in the face of compulsive gambling, as it distorts one's judgment and decision-making abilities.\n\nIn summary, this verse serves as a stark reminder of the detrimental effects of gambling on various aspects of one's life. It underscores Thiruvalluvar's wisdom and his understanding of human behavior, as he advises against habits that can lead to self-destruction..The kural verse:இழத்தொறூஉம் காதலிக்கும் சூதேபோல் துன்பம்உழத்தொறூஉம் காதற்று உயிர். ,translates to :Love for game grows with every loss As love for life with sorrows grows,and it's explantion is :The Kural 940 is a profound reflection on the nature of attachment, particularly in relation to suffering. It uses the metaphor of a gambler who, despite repeatedly losing, grows more attached to the act of gambling. Just so, the soul grows more attached to the body, the more it suffers through it.\n\nThe core idea is the paradox of attachment and suffering. The more one suffers, the more one tends to cling to the source of suffering, instead of letting go. This could be interpreted as a commentary on the human tendency to hold on to familiar pain rather than embracing the uncertainty of change. \n\nIn the context of the body and soul, the verse suggests that suffering often reinforces our identification with the physical body, intensifying the illusion of the self as being purely physical. This could be a reminder of the need to recognize our spiritual nature and not get overly attached to the physical body, which is transient and subject to suffering.\n\nOverall, this verse is a profound commentary on the nature of attachment, suffering and the need for spiritual understanding. It reminds us of the importance of discerning the transient physical body from the eternal soul, and to not let suffering reinforce our attachments, but rather use it as a catalyst for spiritual growth..The kural verse:மிகினும் குறையினும் நோய்செய்யும் நூலோர்வளிமுதலா எண்ணிய மூன்று. ,translates to :Wind, bile and phlegm three cause disease So doctors deem it more or less,and it's explantion is :Kural 941 speaks about the importance of maintaining balance in food intake and physical activity in order to prevent diseases. According to ancient medical texts, the three primary elements of the human body are Vata (air or flatulence), Pitta (bile or biliousness), and Kapha (phlegm or mucus). If these elements are in proper balance, the body remains healthy. However, any imbalance, either an excess or deficiency, can lead to various ailments. \n\nThis imbalance can occur due to overeating or under-eating, as well as excessive physical exertion or lack of sufficient physical activity. Therefore, the verse emphasizes the need for moderation in both food intake and physical work as the key to maintaining good health and preventing diseases. \n\nThis principle is still relevant today, with modern medical science stressing the importance of a balanced diet and regular exercise to maintain overall health and prevent various lifestyle-related diseases..The kural verse:மருந்தென வேண்டாவாம் யாக்கைக்கு அருந்தியதுஅற்றது போற்றி உணின். ,translates to :After digestion one who feeds His body no medicine needs,and it's explantion is :Kural 942 promotes the idea of mindful eating and the importance of understanding one's own body for maintaining good health. The verse suggests that one should not consume food until what was previously eaten has been fully digested. This practice ensures a healthy metabolism and prevents the accumulation of undigested food, which can lead to various health issues. \n\nThe essence of this verse is to highlight the importance of eating in moderation and at the right time. It asserts that if one is mindful about their eating habits and ensures proper digestion before another meal, the need for medicine can be eliminated. This Kural emphasizes that understanding and respecting our body's signals is the best way to maintain health and prevent diseases. \n\nIn other words, this verse conveys that our body itself is the best indicator of our health, and by paying attention to its signals, we can avoid the need for external intervention or medication. It advocates for a preventive approach to health, which is often more effective than a curative approach. This timeless wisdom holds true even in today's context, where lifestyle diseases are on the rise due to unhealthy eating habits and a lack of understanding of our body's needs..The kural verse:அற்றால் அறவறிந்து உண்க அஃதுடம்புபெற்றான் நெடிதுய்க்கும் ஆறு. ,translates to :Eat food to digestive measure Life in body lasts with pleasure,and it's explantion is :Kural 943 is a verse about the importance of moderation in eating for a healthy and prolonged life. It underlines the concept that one should consume food only after the previous meal has been properly digested. The verse further advises that the amount of food consumed should be in line with one's individual needs and physical condition.\n\nThis Kural is essentially about the practice of mindful eating. It emphasizes the understanding of one's body and its needs. Overeating or eating without proper intervals can disrupt the digestive system and lead to various health problems. Conversely, eating in moderation, keeping in mind the body's capacity for digestion, can contribute to a healthy and long life.\n\nThe verse is deeply rooted in the philosophy of sustainable living and wellness, advocating a lifestyle that is in harmony with nature and our body's natural processes. The 'embodied soul' in the verse refers to the human being, who has a physical body and a spiritual essence (soul). Hence, the verse suggests that taking care of our physical health is also a way of nurturing our spiritual being.\n\nIn conclusion, this Kural encourages a balanced approach to consumption of food, urging us to eat mindfully, respecting our body's capacity and needs, thereby leading a long and healthy life..The kural verse:அற்றது அறிந்து கடைப்பிடித்து மாறல்லதுய்க்க துவரப் பசித்து. ,translates to :Know digestion; with keen appetite Eat what is suitable and right,and it's explantion is :Kural 944 emphasizes the importance of mindful eating, which is a significant aspect of maintaining good health. The verse advises us to ensure that our previous meal has been completely digested before we consume another. This is to prevent overeating and the resultant health complications that might arise from it.\n\nThe verse further suggests that one should eat only when they are genuinely hungry. This principle aligns with the idea of intuitive eating, where one listens to the body's cues for hunger and fullness, instead of eating based on external factors like time or social norms. \n\nMoreover, the verse advises us not to consume food that is disagreeable or unsuitable to our body. This underscores the principle of individuality in diet, acknowledging that every person's body reacts differently to different types of food. What is healthy and nourishing for one person, may not be the same for another. Therefore, it is essential to understand our body and its needs, and consume food accordingly.\n\nIn essence, this verse from Thirukural teaches us to eat mindfully, attentively, and in moderation, to maintain our health and well-being..The kural verse:மாறுபாடு இல்லாத உண்டி மறுத்துண்ணின்ஊறுபாடு இல்லை உயிர்க்கு. ,translates to :With fasting adjusted food right Cures ills of life and makes you bright,and it's explantion is :Kural 945 emphasizes the importance of mindful eating for maintaining a healthy and balanced life. The verse suggests that one should consume food that agrees with their body in a measured and moderate amount. \n\nThe essence of the verse is that one should eat what is suitable for their body without overindulgence. If food is consumed mindfully and in moderation, it will not lead to any health complications or disturbances in one's life. This can be interpreted in two ways - both the quality and the quantity of the food consumed are equally important. \n\nFirstly, the food should be agreeable or suitable to the individual's body. This means that the food shouldn't cause any physical discomfort or allergic reactions. Secondly, the food should be consumed in moderation. Overeating, even of the most nutritious food, can lead to health issues. \n\nTherefore, this verse advocates for a balanced and mindful approach to eating, which ultimately benefits one's overall health and wellbeing. It's a timeless reminder that moderation in everything, including food, is the key to a well-balanced life..The kural verse:இழிவறிந்து உண்பான்கண் இன்பம்போல் நிற்கும்கழிபேர் இரையான்கண் நோய். ,translates to :Who eats with clean stomach gets health With greedy glutton abides ill-health,and it's explantion is :Kural 946 talks about the importance of moderation in eating habits and the ill effects of gluttony. The verse implies that those who consume food with a clear understanding of appropriate proportions and limit their intake to a moderate level will enjoy good health and happiness. This is because their body can efficiently process the amount of food consumed, leading to proper nutrition and energy.\n\nOn the contrary, those who eat excessively, driven by greed or lack of control, invite diseases to their body. This is because overeating puts a strain on the body's digestive system and can lead to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and other health problems.\n\nIn essence, this verse highlights the wisdom in the old saying 'Moderation is the key to good health.' It encourages us to develop a balanced approach to our eating habits for a healthy and fulfilling life. It also serves as a warning against the harmful effects of over-indulgence and gluttony..The kural verse:தீயள வன்றித் தெரியான் பெரிதுண்ணின்நோயள வின்றிப் படும். ,translates to :who glut beyond the hunger's fire Suffer from untold diseases here,and it's explantion is :Kural 947 is a verse about health and moderation. It warns that overeating without understanding the limits of one's hunger can lead to a multitude of diseases. \n\nThe verse emphasizes on the importance of self-restraint and awareness of one's body. It suggests that if one consumes food beyond their body's requirement, and without considering the quality and nutritional value of the food, it can lead to various health problems. This can be interpreted as a caution against gluttony and a reminder of the importance of balance in our diet.\n\nThe verse also indirectly hints at the concept of mindful eating, which involves paying full attention to what one is consuming and how it affects their body. It encourages individuals to understand their body's signals of hunger and satiety and to respect them by eating accordingly.\n\nIn summary, this verse is a profound reminder of the age-old adage, 'You are what you eat', and it advocates for moderation and mindfulness as key to a healthy life..The kural verse:நோய்நாடி நோய்முதல் நாடி அதுதணிக்கும்வாய்நாடி வாய்ப்பச் செயல். ,translates to :Test disease, its cause and cure And apply remedy that is sure,and it's explantion is :Kural 948 emphasizes the importance of a methodical and comprehensive approach to medical treatment. It advises the physician to first understand the nature of the disease, investigate its causes, and identify the most effective methods of treatment. Only then can they proceed to administer the treatment faithfully according to their medical knowledge and principles.\n\nIn a broader interpretation, this verse could also apply to problem-solving in general life. Before attempting to solve a problem, it is crucial to understand the problem thoroughly, identify its root cause, and determine the best possible solution. Only then should one proceed with the solution implementation. \n\nThis verse from Thiru Kural, thus, stresses the importance of a systematic, analytical approach, whether it be in medicine or in life. It promotes thoughtful action based on knowledge and understanding, rather than impulsive reaction..The kural verse:உற்றான் அளவும் பிணியளவும் காலமும்கற்றான் கருதிச் செயல். ,translates to :Let the skilful doctor note The sickmen, sickness, season and treat,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of thoughtful and comprehensive consideration in providing medical care. The learned physician is advised to consider not just the disease itself, but also the patient's age, the nature of the disease, and the time of the year before proceeding with the treatment.\n\nThe age of the patient can play a significant role in how a disease manifests and how the patient responds to treatment. The nature of the disease refers to its severity, symptoms, and potential complications. The time of year is also important as some diseases are seasonal and the body's response to treatment can also vary depending on the season. \n\nThe verse encourages physicians to take a holistic approach to healthcare. It implies that effective treatment is not just about addressing the disease but understanding the patient as a whole, which includes their age, the characteristics of their disease, and the influence of external factors like the season.\n\nIn other words, a skilled physician must be observant, thoughtful, and considerate of all these factors to provide the most effective treatment. This verse underscores the wisdom of the ancient Tamil people in medical science and patient care..The kural verse:உற்றவன் தீர்ப்பான் மருந்துழைச் செல்வானென்றுஅப்பால் நாற் கூற்றே மருந்து. ,translates to :Patient, doctor, medicine and nurse Are four-fold codes of treating course,and it's explantion is :Kural 950 is an insightful verse that provides a holistic perspective on the field of medicine. It explores the essential components of medical science, which, according to Valluvar, are the patient, the physician, the medicine, and the compounder. \n\nThe patient is the one who suffers from an ailment and needs healing. The physician is the skilled professional who diagnoses the condition and devises a treatment plan. The medicine is the therapeutic substance used to treat or manage the ailment. The compounder (also referred to as a pharmacist or apothecary in modern terms) is the individual who prepares and dispenses the medicine.\n\nValluvar emphasizes that each of these components is critical and they all work together to ensure the health and wellbeing of the patient. This holistic view is not only a reflection of the interconnected nature of medical science but also a recognition of the importance of each player in the process of healing.\n\nMoreover, the verse suggests that each of these components has its own sub-divisions or specialties, underlining the complexity and diversity within the field of medicine. This could refer to the various types of patients and their unique needs, the different specializations among physicians, the vast range of medicines available for different ailments, and the varied skills required in the compounding and dispensing of medicines.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse could also serve as a metaphor for the need for collaboration and interdependence in any complex system or endeavor. Each component has a specific role and contributes to the overall success of the system. In essence, the verse is a reminder of the importance of recognizing and valuing the diverse roles and contributions in any complex process, be it in the field of medicine or beyond..The kural verse:இற்பிறந்தார் கண்அல்லது இல்லை இயல்பாகச்செப்பமும் நாணும் ஒருங்கு. ,translates to :Right-sense and bashfulness adorn By nature only the noble-born,and it's explantion is :The Kural 951 beautifully emphasizes on two key qualities - consistency and fear of committing wrong, attributing them as inherent traits of those born in noble families. \n\nThe term 'consistency' here refers to the alignment of thoughts, words, and actions. It signifies that an individual's actions should reflect their words and thoughts, demonstrating their integrity and honesty. \n\nThe 'fear' mentioned in this verse is not a fear of physical danger or threat, but a moral fear or consciousness of committing sin or wrongdoing. This moral fear, or shame as it can be translated, is a sense of guilt that prevents one from doing wrong even when no one is watching. It is an integral part of a person's conscience, acting as a moral compass guiding their actions.\n\nThe verse suggests that these qualities are naturally found in those who are 'high-born' or come from noble families. This can be interpreted in two ways: one, it suggests that noble birth is not just about wealth or social status, but about moral and ethical values. Two, it implies that these values are often instilled and nurtured in an individual by their family and upbringing.\n\nTherefore, the verse imparts the message that a person's nobility is not judged by their birth alone but by their actions, their consistency of thought, word, and deed, and their fear of committing wrong..The kural verse:ஒழுக்கமும் வாய்மையும் நாணும்இம் மூன்றும்இழுக்கார் குடிப்பிறந் தார். ,translates to :The noble-born lack not these three: Good conduct, truth and modesty,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse (952) emphasizes the three fundamental virtues that are considered the hallmark of nobility or high birth, irrespective of societal status or wealth. These virtues are: good manners (Ozhukkam), truthfulness (Vaiyamai), and modesty or respect (Naanam).\n\nGood manners (Ozhukkam) refers to the appropriate, respectful, and ethical behavior one exhibits in their daily interactions. This includes being mindful of others' feelings, honoring societal norms and expectations, and conducting oneself with dignity and respect.\n\nTruthfulness (Vaiyamai) underscores the importance of honesty and integrity. It is about being truthful in words and actions, keeping promises, and not deceiving others.\n\nModesty or respect (Naanam) refers to being humble, showing respect to others, and maintaining one's dignity. It discourages arrogance, rudeness, and disrespect.\n\nThiru Kural asserts that those who embody these qualities are truly high-born or noble, regardless of their socio-economic background. Their nobility is defined not by their birth or wealth, but by their character and conduct. The verse emphasizes that those who uphold these virtues will never deviate from them, as they are ingrained in their character.\n\nIn essence, this verse prompts us to understand that real nobility or high birth is not about lineage or wealth, but about maintaining good manners, being truthful, and upholding modesty and respect..The kural verse:நகைஈகை இன்சொல் இகழாமை நான்கும்வகையென்ப வாய்மைக் குடிக்கு. ,translates to :Smile, gift, sweet words and courtesy These four mark true nobility,and it's explantion is :Kural 953 highlights four distinct qualities that are said to be the hallmarks of individuals of high birth or nobility. These traits reflect the moral and ethical standards that these individuals uphold and reflect their caliber and character.\n\n1. \"A cheerful countenance\": This refers to the ability to maintain a pleasant and welcoming demeanor. It is an indication of an optimistic and positive attitude towards life.\n\n2. \"Liberality\": This refers to generosity or the willingness to give and share with others. It is a testament to the individual's understanding of the importance of empathy and compassion.\n\n3. \"Pleasant words\": This refers to the use of kind and gentle words while communicating. It is a reflection of the individual's respect and consideration for others.\n\n4. \"An unreviling disposition\": This signifies the quality of refraining from disparaging or belittling others. It is an indication of the individual's humility and understanding of the value of respect.\n\nThese qualities are not necessarily tied to one's birth or lineage but are indicative of their moral character. They are the traits of a person who possesses truthfulness and authenticity (vaymai) and are seen as a true testament to their nobility. \n\nThus, the kural emphasizes that nobility is not simply a matter of birth or status, but is characterized by these noble qualities. It advocates for the development and demonstration of these traits as a means of displaying one's true nobility..The kural verse:அடுக்கிய கோடி பெறினும் குடிப்பிறந்தார்குன்றுவ செய்தல் இலர். ,translates to :Even for crores, the noble mood Cannot bend to degrading deed,and it's explantion is :This Thirukkural verse 954 emphasizes the value of nobility and integrity over wealth. The verse suggests that those who are born into noble families or who have cultivated noble qualities will never engage in actions that would tarnish their honor or dignity, even if they are offered immense wealth. It underlines the principle that nobility and moral character are not dependent on material wealth, but on one's actions and behavior. \n\nIn a broader sense, this Kural underscores the importance of values and ethical behavior over materialistic gain. It propounds the idea that maintaining one's dignity and preserving the honor of one's lineage is far more important than accumulating wealth through unscrupulous means. This verse reminds us that wealth should never be a reason to compromise our values, and that true nobility lies not in riches, but in upholding one's integrity irrespective of circumstances..The kural verse:வழங்குவ துள்வீழ்ந்தக் கண்ணும் பழங்குடிபண்பில் தலைப்பிரிதல் இன்று. ,translates to :The means of gift may dwindle; yet Ancient homes guard their noble trait,and it's explantion is :Kural 955 is a testament to the unwavering character of those born into noble families. The verse elaborates on the concept of generosity and liberality, particularly in the context of those who come from ancient and esteemed lineages. \n\nThe verse asserts that even if these individuals face a fall in their fortunes, they will not let go of their inherent virtue of liberality. In other words, their generous character does not fluctuate with the ups and downs of their material wealth. This is because they hold their noble lineage in high regard and strive to uphold the values and virtues associated with it, including benevolence and generosity. \n\nThe cultural context here is steeped in the traditional Tamil value system, which places great emphasis on nobility of character. A person's worth is not measured by their wealth but by their virtues. Even in the face of adversity or financial decline, maintaining one's inherent virtues is seen as the true mark of nobility. \n\nThis verse is a moral lesson on the importance of sticking to one's principles and virtues, despite external circumstances. It encourages us to define our value not in terms of material possessions, but in terms of our moral and ethical qualities..The kural verse:சலம்பற்றிச் சால்பில செய்யார்மா சற்றகுலம்பற்றி வாழ்தும் என் பார். ,translates to :Who guard their family prestige pure Stoop not to acts of cunning lure,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse emphasizes the importance of maintaining the integrity and honor of one's family. It suggests that those who value their family's reputation and wish to uphold its dignity will not engage in deceitful or inappropriate actions that could tarnish it.\n\nThe verse highlights the cultural value placed on family honor in traditional Tamil society, where the actions of one family member have implications for the entire family. The verse thus motivates individuals to act responsibly and with integrity, refraining from dishonorable deeds even in times of hardship or temptation.\n\nIn essence, the verse implies that the preservation of one's family honor is a guiding principle that one should adhere to. This principle serves as a moral compass, deterring one from engaging in deceitful or unworthy actions that could potentially harm the family's reputation. It speaks to the broader ethical concept of living an honorable life, with respect for family values and societal norms..The kural verse:குடிப்பிறந்தார் கண்விளங்கும் குற்றம் விசும்பின்மத஧க்கண் மறுப்போல் உயர்ந்து. ,translates to :The faults of nobly-born are seen Like on the sky the spots of moon,and it's explantion is :Kural 957 delves into the concept of individual honor and reputation, especially in the context of those born into esteemed families or clans. It draws a parallel between personal flaws and the spots on the moon, a celestial body known for its radiant glow in the evening sky.\n\nThe verse suggests that any minor shortcomings or faults in a person who is born into a respectable family are clearly visible, similar to how the spots on the moon are prominent against its luminous background. These faults stand out more prominently because they are in stark contrast to the high standards and expectations associated with their family lineage.\n\nJust as the spots on the moon do not diminish its overall brilliance, these minor flaws do not necessarily mar the individual's entire character or reputation. However, they are more noticeable due to the high regard and respect that their family holds in society. The kural essentially underlines the importance of living up to one's familial or societal expectations and maintaining one's honor and reputation by avoiding any misconduct or dishonorable behavior that may tarnish it..The kural verse:நலத்தின்கண் நாரின்மை தோன்றின் அவனைக்குலத்தின்கண் ஐயப் படும். ,translates to :If manners of the good are rude People deem their pedigree crude,and it's explantion is :Kural 958 emphasizes the importance of affection in a person, regardless of their social status or lineage. It suggests that if a person from a reputed family lacks love and affection, their noble descent might be doubted.\n\nThe verse is a reflection on the value of love and kindness in society. It implies that no matter how affluent or influential one's family might be, if they lack the fundamental human quality of affection, their authenticity of belonging to a noble family will be questioned. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar suggests that the true mark of nobility is not wealth or status, but the quality of affection and love that one shows towards others. This virtue of kindness and affection is considered so vital that its absence can cast doubt even on a person's noble lineage. \n\nIn a broader sense, the verse underscores the significance of emotional intelligence and empathy in maintaining social harmony and respect. It teaches us that emotional virtues are as important, if not more, as material wealth and social status..The kural verse:நிலத்தில் கிடந்தமை கால்காட்டும் காட்டும்குலத்தில் பிறந்தார்வாய்ச் சொல். ,translates to :Soil's nature is seen in sprout The worth of birth from words flow out,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural emphasizes the significance of speech in revealing one's origin and upbringing. Just as the type and quality of the crop reveal the nature of the soil it grew in, the speech of an individual reflects the family and the environment they were born and raised in.\n\nThe verse suggests that our words and the manner in which we express ourselves are not merely a means of communication but also a reflection of our background. This includes our family values, the cultural and societal norms we were exposed to, our education, and our experiences. These factors play a vital role in shaping our perspectives, attitudes, and the way we interact with others.\n\nFurthermore, the verse subtly underlines the importance of good speech, hinting that nobility and virtue are often associated with eloquence and wisdom in speech. It serves as a reminder that our words hold power and can influence the way others perceive us. Therefore, it encourages us to cultivate good speech, which is reflective of a good upbringing and noble lineage.\n\nIn a broader sense, it also stresses the importance of education and learning, as these are primary factors that shape our speech. This verse, therefore, not only serves as an observation of human behavior but also as a piece of advice on personal development and social conduct..The kural verse:நலம்வேண்டின் நாணுடைமை வேண்டும் குலம்வேண்டின்வேண்டுக யார்க்கும் பணிவு. ,translates to :All gain good name by modesty Nobility by humility,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse emphasizes the importance of modesty and humility in attaining respect and preserving one's family's prestige. The first line states that if a person desires a good reputation, they must have modesty. Modesty here signifies a sense of shame or self-restraint that prevents one from engaging in unworthy actions. This quality helps in maintaining one's dignity and garnering respect from others. \n\nThe second line of the verse states that if one wishes to uphold their family's honor or status, they must show humility towards everyone. Humility, in this context, refers to being respectful and considerate towards all, irrespective of their social status. This attitude not only enhances the individual's respect but also contributes to the preservation and enhancement of their family's standing in society.\n\nThus, this Kural verse underlines the significance of modesty and humility as key virtues for personal and familial prestige. It implies that respect and honor are not just based on wealth or power, but more significantly, on one's character and behavior towards others..The kural verse:இன்றி அமையாச் சிறப்பின ஆயினும்குன்ற வருப விடல். ,translates to :Though needed for your life in main, From mean degrading acts refrain,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of preserving one's family honor and reputation. It suggests that even if an action is crucial or seemingly indispensable, if it has the potential to bring disgrace or reduce the dignity of one's family, it should be avoided at all costs. \n\nThe verse underlines the value of family honor in the society and the individual's responsibility to uphold it. The moral implication is that an individual's actions reflect not only on themselves but also their family and lineage. Hence, it is paramount to abstain from actions that can tarnish this image, even if not doing them might lead to severe consequences, including death.\n\nThis Kural teaches us about the moral responsibility we carry as a part of a family and a society. It encourages individuals to prioritize the preservation of their family's honor over personal gains or necessities. It is a call to uphold our ethical integrity, even when faced with challenging circumstances. \n\nIn essence, the verse underscores the principle of prioritizing long-term reputation and honor over short-term gains or needs. It is a classic example of Thiruvalluvar's wisdom and the timeless values he propagated through his verses..The kural verse:சீரினும் சீரல்ல செய்யாரே சீரொடுபேராண்மை வேண்டு பவர். ,translates to :Who seek honour and manly fame Don't do mean deeds even for name,and it's explantion is :The verse 962 of Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of maintaining personal honor and dignity, even in the pursuit of fame. The verse suggests that those who truly value their honor will not engage in any actions that are dishonorable, even if such actions could potentially bring them fame or recognition.\n\nThis verse highlights the concept of moral integrity and the importance of staying true to one's principles. It suggests that the pursuit of fame should not come at the cost of one's honor. In other words, a person's actions should be guided by their personal values and principles, rather than the potential for gaining fame or recognition. \n\nThe verse implies a strong critique of those who compromise their personal values and honor in their pursuit of fame. It encourages individuals to hold fast to their principles and moral integrity, even when faced with the potential for gaining fame. \n\nIn the context of the broader social and cultural values, this verse underscores the importance of personal honor and dignity as a guiding principle in life. It reflects the traditional Tamil ethic of upholding one's honor and dignity as a fundamental aspect of personal identity and social standing. \n\nIn essence, this verse serves as a reminder that true honor and dignity lie in maintaining one's moral integrity and personal values, rather than in the pursuit of fame or recognition..The kural verse:பெருக்கத்து வேண்டும் பணிதல் சிறியசுருக்கத்து வேண்டும் உயர்வு. ,translates to :Be humble in prosperity In decline uphold dignity,and it's explantion is :Kural 963 emphasizes the importance of maintaining the right attitude, based on one's circumstances. It implies that humility should be the virtue of the prosperous, while dignity should be the shield of those facing adversity.\n\nDuring times of abundance and prosperity, one should not let success get to their head, instead, they should be humble. This humility keeps them grounded and makes them endearing to others. It serves as a reminder that the wealth and success they enjoy are transient and can vary with time.\n\nOn the other hand, during periods of adversity, particularly when one's wealth diminishes, one must uphold their dignity and self-respect. They should not degrade themselves or succumb to humiliation due to their circumstances. Maintaining dignity in the face of adversity is a testament to one's strength of character and resilience.\n\nIn other words, this verse teaches us to be humble in success and dignified in failure, which are valuable guiding principles for a balanced life..The kural verse:தலையின் இழிந்த மயிரனையர் மாந்தர்நிலையின் இழிந்தக் கடை. ,translates to :Like hair fallen from head are those Who fall down from their high status,and it's explantion is :Kural 964 draws a vivid comparison between a person who has lost their esteemed status and a strand of hair that has fallen from the head. The analogy is used to depict the unfortunate circumstance of the individual who has lost their dignity, respect, or honor in society. Just as the fallen strand of hair loses its value and worth, so does the person who has lost their elevated position. This Kural emphasizes the importance of maintaining one's respect and honor in society. It serves as a reminder that a person's value and worth are significantly tied to their societal standing and behavior. It also implicitly advises individuals to act wisely and uphold their moral and ethical responsibilities to preserve their status and avoid disgrace..The kural verse:குன்றின் அனையாரும் குன்றுவர் குன்றுவகுன்றி அனைய செயின். ,translates to :Even hill-like men will sink to nought With abrus-grain-like small default,and it's explantion is :Kural 965 emphasizes the importance of integrity in maintaining one's respect and stature in society. It states that even individuals who stand tall and esteemed, akin to a mighty hill, will be perceived as low or debased if they partake in ignoble actions, even as small as a grain of sand.\n\nThis verse teaches us that one's status or prestige in society is not just determined by their wealth, power, or lineage, but more importantly, by their actions and behavior. Even a small misstep or compromising act can tarnish their image and bring them down from their exalted position. It thus underscores the need for maintaining ethical conduct and honorable behavior, regardless of one's stature or position in society.\n\nThe Kural serves as a reminder that dignity and respect are not inherent to one's status but are earned through one's virtues and deeds. It warns of the consequences of engaging in lowly acts, emphasizing that a person's actions define them more than their status or standing. The comparison to a hill and a grain of sand illustrates the stark contrast between the perceived and actual worth of a person when their actions are not in line with their stature.\n\nIn essence, it is a moral lesson on the importance of personal integrity, ethical conduct, and the power of actions in defining one's character and reputation..The kural verse:புகழ்இன்றால் புத்தேள்நாட்டு உய்யாதால் என்மற்றுஇகழ்வார்பின் சென்று நிலை. ,translates to :Why fawn on men that scorn you here It yields no fame, heaven's bliss neither,and it's explantion is :Kural 966 emphasizes the importance of maintaining one's dignity and self-respect. It questions the wisdom of tailing those who disrespect and belittle you, and whether such subservience would earn you any praise or merit, either in this life or the next.\n\nThe verse asserts that following those who scorn you, tolerating their mockery and sacrificing your dignity in the process, will not yield any true honor or respect. The phrase \"at their bidding wait\" suggests a state of servitude or dependency, wherein a person's actions are dictated by the whims and wishes of those who devalue them. Such a state of existence does not bring any real honor or esteem.\n\nMoreover, the verse suggests such conduct will not result in any spiritual blessings or divine rewards either. The idea of 'celestial abode' often symbolizes the ultimate reward for virtuous and honorable life in many cultures and religions, including Hinduism. So, the verse suggests that such subservience and loss of dignity will not lead to such divine rewards.\n\nIn essence, the Kural advises maintaining self-respect and dignity, and not to follow or depend on those who scorn or deride you. It suggests that such a life is neither honorable in this world nor rewarded in the next, implying that one should always strive to live with dignity and respect..The kural verse:ஒட்டார்பின் சென்றொருவன் வாழ்தலின் அந்நிலையேகெட்டான் எனப்படுதல் நன்று. ,translates to :Better it is to die forlorn Than live as slaves of those who scorn,and it's explantion is :Kural 967 addresses the importance of personal dignity and self-respect. It asserts that it's preferable to die maintaining one's integrity than to live in disgrace by submitting to those who belittle or disrespect you.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that one's honor and self-worth should never be compromised for the sake of mere survival. Living under the shadow of someone who disrespects or demeans you is seen as a life of humiliation and degradation. Such a life, according to this Kural, is worse than death. This point of view upholds the value of personal dignity and self-respect over the mere physical existence.\n\nThis Kural encourages people to live life on their own terms, with integrity and honor, rather than compromising their values for the sake of survival. It is a strong statement on the value of personal dignity and the importance of not losing one's self-respect, even in the face of adversity or hardship. It reflects the Tamil cultural emphasis on personal honor and societal standing. \n\nIn essence, the Kural suggests that it is better to die with honor than live in dishonor. It implies that the worth of a life is measured not by its length but by the dignity and respect with which it is lived..The kural verse:மருந்தோமற்று ஊன்ஓம்பும் வாழ்க்கை பெருந்தகைமைபீடழிய வந்த இடத்து. ,translates to :Is nursing body nectar sweet Even when one's honour is lost?,and it's explantion is :Kural 968 explores the concept of honour and dignity, particularly within the context of high-born or noble individuals. It suggests that preserving life at the expense of one's honour is not a suitable remedy against death. In other words, life without honour is not worth living, especially for those of high birth or nobility. \n\nThe verse underscores the importance of maintaining one's dignity and reputation, even in the face of adversity or danger. It implies that it is better to die with honour than to live without it. This belief is rooted in the traditional values of Tamil society, where honour and dignity are highly valued. \n\nThe verse also reminds us that true nobility lies not in birth, but in upholding one's principles and honour. Thus, those who compromise their honour for the sake of life are seen as bringing disgrace upon themselves. \n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse can be a reflection on the value of integrity and moral courage. It emphasises the idea that it is more important to live a life of principle and honour, than to simply exist without these virtues. \n\nIn essence, Kural 968 is a powerful statement on the importance of honour and dignity, asserting that life without these is not truly life at all. It serves as a reminder that one should not compromise one's principles and dignity, even in the face of death..The kural verse:மயிர்நீப்பின் வாழாக் கவரிமா அன்னார்உயிர்நீப்பர் மானம் வரின். ,translates to :Honour lost, the noble expire Like a yak that loses its hair,and it's explantion is :Kural 969 is a profound verse about honor and dignity. The kural uses the metaphor of a 'kavarimaan' (yark), a particular kind of animal that is known to die if it loses even a single hair from its body. The kural likens the honor of a person to the hair of this animal, implying that just as this creature cannot survive the loss of a single hair, a dignified individual would not wish to live if their honor is compromised.\n\nThis verse sends a strong message about the importance of honor and pride in one's life. It suggests that for some noble souls, their honor is as vital to them as life itself. Losing honor, for them, is akin to losing their life. They would rather forfeit their life than continuing to live with damaged dignity.\n\nThis verse also reflects the cultural significance of honor in Tamil society. It emphasizes the extent to which an individual was expected to protect their honor and the lengths they might go to preserve it, even if it meant giving up their life. This powerful metaphor is a testament to the high value placed on personal honor and the social stigma associated with its loss. \n\nIn essence, this kural underlines that life without honor is not worth living, reinforcing the importance of upholding one's dignity at all costs..The kural verse:இளிவரின் வாழாத மானம் உடையார்ஒளிதொழுது ஏத்தும் உலகு. ,translates to :Their light the world adores and hails  Who will not live when honour fails,and it's explantion is :The verse 970 of Thiru Kural emphasizes the value of honor and dignity in life. The verse states that the world always respects and admires those who would rather give up their life than face humiliation or disgrace. In other words, those individuals who hold their honor in such high regard that they would prefer death over shame are the ones who earn universal admiration and respect.\n\nIn the cultural context, this verse reflects the ancient Tamil society's emphasis on personal honor and integrity. It is also a universal truth that transcends cultural and temporal boundaries. A person's honor, represented by their actions and principles, is a crucial measure of their character. This verse suggests that choosing to maintain one's dignity, even at the cost of one's life, is more commendable than living a life of humiliation.\n\nIn terms of moral interpretation, this verse encourages individuals to uphold their honor and dignity under all circumstances. It suggests that it is better to face the harshest consequences, even death, rather than compromise on one's principles and self-respect. This notion is a powerful testament to the importance of personal integrity and honor in shaping one's life and the way the world perceives them..The kural verse:ஒளிஒருவற்கு உள்ள வெறுக்கை இளிஒருவற்குஅஃதிறந்து வாழ்தும் எனல். ,translates to :A heart of courage lives in light  Devoid of that one's life is night,and it's explantion is :Kural 971 explores the concepts of courage and the lack thereof, and their distinct impacts on a person's life. The verse metaphorically describes courage as a \"light\" that illuminates one's life. This \"light\" of courage is seen as a source of strength, confidence, and resilience that aids in overcoming challenges, taking bold steps, and leading a fulfilling life. \n\nOn the contrary, the absence of this courage is referred to as \"darkness.\" Living life without the courage to face challenges, make changes, or stand up for oneself results in a life of destitution and misery. The verse portrays this lack of courage as a dark, gloomy existence where growth and progress are restricted.\n\nIn essence, the verse emphasizes the significance of courage in leading a prosperous, dignified life. It suggests that a life devoid of courage, where one merely exists rather than truly lives, is full of darkness and despair. This verse is a potent reminder of the power of courage and the necessity of nurturing it within oneself to lead a meaningful life..The kural verse:பிறப்பொக்கும் எல்லா உயிர்க்கும் சிறப்பொவ்வாசெய்தொழில் வேற்றுமை யான். ,translates to :All beings are the same in birth But work decides their varied worth,and it's explantion is :Kural 972 emphasizes the fundamental unity of all human beings in terms of birth, while acknowledging the diversity in their characteristics and capabilities due to their individual actions. The verse suggests that all individuals, regardless of their background or social standing, share a common origin in birth. However, it's their actions and deeds that set them apart and create a distinction among them.\n\nThis Kural underlines the importance of one's deeds or actions in determining their individual characteristics and societal standing. It highlights the concept that one's worth or value is not determined by their birth or lineage, but rather, it's their actions, behaviors, and achievements that define them. \n\nIn essence, this verse from Thirukkural stresses the importance of personal responsibility, moral action, and individual merit, emphasizing that our actions are a true measure of our character and worth. It advocates for a society where individuals are evaluated and respected based on their actions and contributions, rather than their birth or social status. \n\nThis Kural aligns with the broader philosophy of the Thirukkural, which promotes virtues such as righteousness, justice, and equality, while discouraging discrimination and bias based on birth or caste..The kural verse:மேலிருந்தும் மேலல்லார் மேலல்லர் கீழிருந்தும்கீழல்லார் கீழல் லவர். ,translates to :Ignoble high not high they are The noble low not low they fare,and it's explantion is :The given verse states that the position or rank one holds does not define their greatness or baseness; instead, it is their inherent qualities and characteristics that determine it. Even if a person with inferior qualities is placed in a high position, they won't be considered great because their nature remains base. Similarly, a person with superior qualities will not become base or inferior, even if they are found in a lowly position. This verse emphasizes the importance of inherent moral and ethical characteristics above the outwardly status or position in society. It suggests that one's true worth is determined by their qualities, values, and actions, not by their social or professional ranking..The kural verse:ஒருமை மகளிரே போலப் பெருமையும்தன்னைத்தான் கொண்டொழுகின் உண்டு. ,translates to :Greatness like woman's chastity Is guarded by self-varacity,and it's explantion is :Kural 974 emphasizes the virtue of self-restraint and moral discipline. It compares an individual's self-discipline to the chastity of a devoted wife. Just as a virtuous woman remains loyal to her husband, never even allowing her thoughts to wander towards another man, a person should exercise the same level of self-restraint, maintaining their integrity and uprightness at all times.\n\nThe verse suggests that if one can control their impulses, remain true to their principles, and sustain their moral conduct without deviation, they will attain great honor and respect, similar to the reverence and respect a virtuous woman commands. \n\nTherefore, the essence of this verse lies in the promotion of self-discipline, moral integrity, and the maintenance of one's own character, emphasizing that such virtues lead to the attainment of great dignity, much like the honor bestowed upon a faithful wife..The kural verse:பெருமை யுடையவர் ஆற்றுவார் ஆற்றின்அருமை உடைய செயல். ,translates to :Great souls when their will is active Do mighty deeds rare to achieve,and it's explantion is :Kural 975 is about the characteristic of greatness and its ability to accomplish challenging tasks in the appropriate manner. The verse emphasizes that those who are truly great have the capacity to perform deeds that are difficult for others, and they do so in the correct and ethical way.\n\nThe greatness referred to in this verse is not based on status, power, or wealth, but on the ability to tackle and overcome challenges with wisdom, skill, and morality. Even when faced with adversity or a reduction in their condition, these individuals do not compromise on the quality or ethics of their actions. Instead, they rise to the occasion, demonstrating their greatness through their actions.\n\nThis verse is a reminder that true greatness lies in our ability to handle difficulties with grace, skill, and integrity. It encourages us to strive for this kind of greatness in our own lives, emphasizing that the value of our actions lies not just in what we do, but in how we do it..The kural verse:சிறியார் உணர்ச்சியுள் இல்லை பெரியாரைப்பேணிக் கொள் வேம் என்னும் நோக்கு. ,translates to :The petty-natured ones have not The mind to seek and befriend the great,and it's explantion is :Kural 976 discusses the nature of individuals with a limited or narrow mindset. It suggests that those who are small-minded or 'base' do not possess the disposition to appreciate and seek the company of those who are great or magnanimous. \n\nThe verse implies a lack of aspiration among lesser people to learn from and emulate the virtues of the great. They do not perceive the value of associating with such individuals, as they fail to comprehend the potential benefits and personal growth that could emanate from such association. \n\nThis verse essentially underlines the importance of personal growth and enlightenment, highlighting that it is often achieved through the company and guidance of those who are wise and magnanimous. It subtly critiques those who, due to their limited understanding, miss out on opportunities to elevate their understanding and character. \n\nIn its broader interpretation, the verse also encourages self-reflection and a continuous quest for betterment by associating with and learning from those who have achieved higher levels of wisdom and morality..The kural verse:இறப்பே புரிந்த தொழிற்றாம் சிறப்புந்தான்சீரல் லவர்கண் படின். ,translates to :The base with power and opulence Wax with deeds of insolence,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse underpins the notion that wealth, education and high social status can lead to an inflated sense of pride if possessed by those who lack the right character or moral grounding. \n\nThe verse suggests that when such privileges fall into the hands of those who are morally inferior or base, they tend to misuse them, leading to arrogance and overstepping of boundaries. This could result in behaviors that are damaging to both themselves and the society they are part of. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, the author of Thiru Kural, emphasizes the importance of virtue, humility, and good character in handling wealth, education, and social status. Without these moral qualities, these privileges can transform into sources of hubris and misuse. \n\nThis reflects the timeless wisdom of Thiru Kural that privileges should be accompanied by morality and humility to harness their potential for the betterment of oneself and society..The kural verse:பணியுமாம் என்றும் பெருமை சிறுமைஅணியுமாம் தன்னை வியந்து. ,translates to :Greatness bends with modesty Meanness vaunts with vanity,and it's explantion is :Kural 978 emphasizes the contrasting behaviors of the noble and the ignoble, underlining the virtues of humility and the vices of arrogance.\n\nThe verse asserts that those who possess inherent greatness or nobility will always conduct themselves with humility, regardless of their circumstances or the company they find themselves in. They do not seek to assert their superiority or demand recognition for their virtues. Instead, they choose to downplay their accomplishments, maintaining a demeanor of modesty and respect towards all. This humility is not a sign of weakness, but rather a reflection of their strength and character.\n\nOn the contrary, those of a lower character or the mean-spirited, often find themselves inflated with self-praise and arrogance. They are quick to boast about their abilities or achievements, seeking validation and admiration from others. They tend to exalt themselves, often overestimating their worth and capabilities. This behavior is indicative of their insecurities and their lack of genuine substance or value.\n\nThrough this verse, Thiruvalluvar emphasizes the importance of humility as a marker of true greatness. It serves as a reminder that genuine worth does not require validation or recognition from others, and that arrogance is often a cover for underlying deficiencies. It also acts as a guide for personal conduct, encouraging humility and discouraging self-glorification..The kural verse:பெருமை பெருமிதம் இன்மை சிறுமைபெருமிதம் ஊர்ந்து விடல். ,translates to :Greatness is free from insolence Littleness swells with that offence,and it's explantion is :Kural 979 speaks about the concepts of 'pride' and 'humility', and their roles in defining one's greatness or meanness. \n\nThe first line of the verse, \"Perumai perumidham inmai\" translates to \"Freedom from conceit is (the nature of true) greatness\". This suggests that true greatness lies not in flaunting one's achievements or capabilities, but in modesty and humility. It emphasizes that those who attain greatness should not succumb to the temptation of pride or arrogance. Instead, they should remain humble, acknowledging that their achievements are not solely their own but the result of many factors, including the support of others and the opportunities they've been given.\n\nThe second line, \"Sirumai perumidham oorndhu vidal\" translates to \"obstinacy therein is (that of) meanness\". This line suggests that insisting on one's greatness, especially without any valid reason, is a sign of meanness or pettiness. It criticizes those who are stubborn in their arrogance, unable to accept criticism or advice due to their inflated sense of self-worth. \n\nOverall, the verse encourages humility and discourages arrogance, asserting that true greatness is characterized by modesty and openness, while meanness is defined by obstinate pride. It is a reminder that humility not only makes an individual great but also earns them the respect and admiration of others..The kural verse:அற்றம் மறைக்கும் பெருமை சிறுமைதான்குற்றமே கூறி விடும். ,translates to :Weakness of others greatness screens Smallness defects alone proclaims,and it's explantion is :The Thiru Kural verse 980 emphasizes the virtue of discretion and the ability to conceal others' faults as a sign of nobility and greatness. It emphasizes that those with a magnanimous spirit focus on the strengths of others and refrain from highlighting their weaknesses or faults. They understand the human tendency to err and choose to foster an environment of support and positivity. \n\nIn contrast, those with a petty or base mindset latch onto the faults of others and expose them, often to make themselves feel superior or to undermine the other person. This behavior, according to the verse, is a sign of inferiority and small-mindedness. \n\nThe verse encourages us to foster a forgiving and understanding attitude, encouraging the good in others while overlooking their flaws. It suggests that we should not indulge in fault-finding or gossip, but rather we should help each other grow and improve by focusing on strengths and virtues. \n\nThis teaching aligns with many ethical and moral systems around the world, which advocate for empathy, understanding, and positive reinforcement over criticism and judgement. It's a reminder that our actions and attitudes towards others are a reflection of our own character and moral standing..The kural verse:கடன்என்ப நல்லவை எல்லாம் கடன்அறிந்துசான்றாண்மை மேற்கொள் பவர்க்கு. ,translates to :All goodness is duty to them  Who are dutiful and sublime,and it's explantion is :Kural 981 emphasizes the importance of understanding one's duty and behaving with moral righteousness. People who are aware of their responsibilities and fulfill them in a virtuous manner perceive all their actions as their natural duties. The essence of this verse is that when one is conscious of their ethical duties and performs them with utmost sincerity, all their actions are deemed good and justifiable.\n\nIn a broader perspective, this Kural elucidates that our moral responsibilities are not burdensome obligations, but a natural part of our lives. This perspective instills a sense of purpose and creates a harmonious life. It encourages individuals to be more proactive in their actions and to view every task or duty as an opportunity to do good.\n\nIn the cultural context, this Kural teaches that the path of righteousness is not forced upon us, but it is a path that we should willingly accept and follow. It is a call to acknowledge and embrace our responsibilities, and to perform them with integrity and virtue, thereby making all our actions inherently good. This verse thus promotes a sense of personal responsibility and ethical behavior in society..The kural verse:குணநலம் சான்றோர் நலனே பிறநலம்எந்நலத்து உள்ளதூஉம் அன்று. ,translates to :Good in the great is character Than that there is nothing better,and it's explantion is :Kural 982 emphasizes the importance of moral virtues and goodness over all other forms of pleasures or delights. It states that the only real delight or goodness for the virtuous or the 'perfect' people is their moral character or virtues. Any other forms of delights, most likely referring to materialistic or sensual pleasures, are not considered true delights. \n\nThis can be interpreted as a call for prioritizing moral character and goodness over temporary or superficial pleasures. The verse implies that true happiness or delight comes from being virtuous and good, and not from indulging in worldly or sensual pleasures. \n\nIn essence, the verse emphasizes the principle that moral virtues and goodness are the highest forms of delight, and all other forms of pleasure are inferior and do not bring true happiness..The kural verse:அன்புநாண் ஒப்புரவு கண்ணோட்டம் வாய்மையொடுஐந்துசால் ஊன்றிய தூண். ,translates to :Love, truth, regard, modesty, grace These five are virtue's resting place,and it's explantion is :Kural 983 emphasizes the five pillars that uphold the edifice of virtue, which are love, a sense of shame against wrongdoing, benevolence, favor, and truthfulness. \n\nFirstly, love is the fundamental sentiment that engenders harmony and peace. It is the basic feeling that promotes understanding and builds bridges of compassion among people. \n\nSecondly, the fear of sin or a sense of shame against wrongdoing is crucial as it acts as a deterrent against immoral actions. It implies a moral conscience that guides one's actions.\n\nThirdly, benevolence refers to a sense of goodwill or kindness towards others. This quality encourages one to do good for others, fostering a sense of community and mutual support.\n\nFourthly, favor refers to the act of bestowing kindness or goodwill onto others without expecting anything in return. It is a selfless act that contributes to the overall well-being of society.\n\nLastly, truthfulness is the cornerstone of trust and integrity. It fosters transparency and honesty, which are essential for maintaining social order and justice.\n\nThese five qualities, according to the verse, form the robust pillars that support the structure of virtuous living. They are essential for an individual to lead a morally upright and fulfilled life..The kural verse:கொல்லா நலத்தது நோன்மை பிறர்தீமைசொல்லா நலத்தது சால்பு. ,translates to :Not to kill is penance pure Not to slander virtue sure,and it's explantion is :Kural 984 emphasizes on two key aspects of virtuous life, namely non-harming and discretion. The first part of the verse speaks about \"non-harming\". It asserts that true penance or spiritual discipline lies not in rigorous physical practices but in abstaining from causing any harm to any living beings. This idea roots deeply in the premise of 'Ahimsa' or non-violence, which is a fundamental principle in many Indian philosophies and religions including Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. \n\nThe second half of the verse extols the virtue of discretion or refraining from highlighting others' faults. It refers to this as 'perfection' or 'graceful conduct'. It encourages individuals to focus on their own flaws and improve themselves rather than pointing out the faults in others. This acts as a reminder that everyone has their own set of weaknesses, and it is not ethical or productive to magnify others' faults while ignoring our own.\n\nIn essence, this Kural instructs one to lead a life of non-violence and discretion, as these are the true indicators of spiritual and moral maturity. It nudges individuals to cultivate empathy, tolerance, self-improvement and refrain from judgement or harm, thereby promoting a peaceful and harmonious society..The kural verse:ஆற்றுவார் ஆற்றல் பணிதல் அதுசான்றோர்மாற்றாரை மாற்றும் படை. ,translates to :Humility is valour's strength A force that averts foes at length,and it's explantion is :Kural 985 focuses on the power of humility and its ability to transform adversaries into allies. It suggests that the real strength of individuals who are capable and accomplished is their humility. They do not boast about their abilities or achievements, but instead carry themselves with modesty and respect towards others, regardless of their status.\n\nThis humility is not seen as a weakness, but rather as a powerful tool or weapon. It is through this humility that accomplished individuals can turn their foes into friends, effectively 'disarming' them. They avert enmity and hostility not through aggression or conflict, but through the power of respect and understanding. \n\nThe verse emphasizes the wisdom in recognizing the strength in humility and the potential it has to transform relationships and resolve conflicts. Essentially, it suggests that humility is the most effective weapon in the arsenal of the wise and accomplished. This principle is applicable not only in personal relationships but also in leadership, conflict resolution, and diplomacy..The kural verse:சால்பிற்குக் கட்டளை யாதெனின் தோல்விதுலையல்லார் கண்ணும் கொளல். ,translates to :To bear repulse e'en from the mean Is the touch-stone of worthy men,and it's explantion is :Kural 986 speaks about the virtue of humility and acceptance. It says that the true measure of a person's greatness is their ability to accept defeat, even if it comes from those they consider as inferiors. The verse uses the metaphor of a touch-stone, which is used to test the purity of gold. Similarly, a person's character and strength are tested when they face defeat or adversity.\n\nThis verse emphasizes that true greatness lies not in never falling, but in accepting the fall graciously and learning from it. It encourages us to be humble, as humility is a sign of wisdom and maturity. It teaches us to accept our mistakes and failures, as they are stepping stones to success. \n\nThe Kural also encourages us to respect everyone, irrespective of their social status, as everyone can teach us something valuable. It discourages arrogance and promotes understanding, acceptance, and respect for others. \n\nIn essence, the Kural tells us that accepting defeat with grace, learning from it and respecting everyone, even those we perceive as lesser than us, is the true hallmark of a great person..The kural verse:இன்னாசெய் தார்க்கும் இனியவே செய்யாக்கால்என்ன பயத்ததோ சால்பு. ,translates to :Of perfection what is the gain If it returns not joy for pain?,and it's explantion is :Thiru Kural 987 delves into the concept of benevolence, highlighting the essence of true goodness. It suggests that the real mark of virtue or goodness is not merely being good to those who are good to us, but also being kind and helpful to those who have caused harm or discomfort.\n\nIn the verse, Valluvar states that if an individual refrains from extending kindness and good deeds to those who have been harmful towards them, then their claim to possess virtuous qualities or 'Saalpu', as mentioned in the verse, is pointless. The phrase 'Saalpu', in the cultural context, refers to the high moral character or virtue. \n\nThe verse emphasizes that the real test of virtue lies in one's ability to maintain their goodness even in the face of adversity or harm caused by others. It's a call to rise above the common human tendency of revenge or tit-for-tat, and instead, respond with kindness and benevolence. \n\nThis Kural encourages the practice of unconditional kindness or goodness, which is a central tenet of many spiritual and philosophical traditions. It teaches that the true measure of a person's moral character is their capacity to maintain their benevolence, even when confronted with harm or ill-will. This, Valluvar suggests, is the pinnacle of virtuous living..The kural verse:இன்மை ஒருவற்கு இளிவன்று சால்பென்னும்திண்மை உண் டாகப் பெறின். ,translates to :No shame there is in poverty To one strong in good quality,and it's explantion is :Kural 988 emphasizes the importance of personal virtues over material wealth. The verse argues that poverty is not a disgrace or a disgraceful state if one possesses good qualities. The \"good qualities\" referred to here— often translated as \"virtue\", \"moral strength\", or \"noble character\"— symbolizes the moral and ethical strength of a person. \n\nThe verse suggests that the lack of material wealth is not a mark of shame if one is rich in virtues. It implies that the true measure of a person's worth is not their material wealth, but their moral and ethical character. In other words, being virtuous gives one a kind of wealth that cannot be measured in material terms. In this light, poverty is seen not as a deficiency, but as a circumstance that does not diminish a person's true value if they possess good qualities.\n\nThe moral interpretation of this verse encourages individuals to cultivate good qualities such as honesty, kindness, and integrity, irrespective of their material circumstances. Rather than viewing poverty as a disadvantage or a shortcoming, it motivates individuals to seek richness in character and moral fiber. This verse thus emphasizes the timeless wisdom that a person's worth is determined more by their character than by their material possessions..The kural verse:ஊழி பெயரினும் தாம்பெயரார் சான்றாண்மைக்குஆழி எனப்படு வார். ,translates to :Aeons may change but not the seer Who is a sea of virtue pure,and it's explantion is :The Kural 989 emphasizes the steadfastness of virtuous individuals. The verse metaphorically refers to the virtuous as 'the shore of the sea of perfection'. Just as the shore remains constant and unchanging despite the fluctuating tides of the sea, the truly virtuous individuals remain consistent in their ethical conduct and integrity, regardless of the shifting times and changing circumstances. They are not swayed by temporal changes or societal transformations, their moral compass and commitment to virtuous living remain unwavering.\n\nThis Kural reminds us that the true measure of a person's character is their steadfast adherence to moral values, irrespective of the changes in external conditions. This unwavering commitment to virtue is what earns them the respect and admiration of others, making them the 'shore of the sea of perfection'. They become the beacon of ethical living, guiding others through their unwavering commitment to righteousness. \n\nThe verse thus highlights the importance of consistency in maintaining ethical standards and the value of steadfastness in the face of changing circumstances. It urges readers to cultivate such unwavering commitment to ethics and integrity, thereby becoming a source of inspiration for others..The kural verse:சான்றவர் சான்றாண்மை குன்றின் இருநிலந்தான்தாங்காது மன்னோ பொறை. ,translates to :The world will not more bear its weight If from high virtue fall the great,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse emphasizes the importance of virtuous character, particularly in those who are seen as morally upright or perfect. The verse states that if there is a flaw or defect in the character of such individuals, it is as if the entire world cannot bear its burden. This metaphorically implies that the world relies on the integrity of its virtuous individuals to maintain balance and order.\n\nThe moral fabric of a society is often held together by people of good character and their actions. These individuals, due to their impeccable character, set the moral standards and serve as role models for others to emulate. When these individuals falter, it creates a ripple effect that can disrupt societal harmony and balance.\n\nThe verse, therefore, underscores the responsibility borne by those who are perceived as virtuous to uphold their integrity. It serves as a reminder that the impact of their actions, due to their influential status, can reach far beyond their immediate surroundings, affecting the balance of the entire world. In essence, it is a call for consistent moral integrity from those who are considered virtuous..The kural verse:எண்பதத்தால் எய்தல் எளிதென்ப யார்மாட்டும்பண்புடைமை என்னும் வழக்கு. ,translates to :To the polite free of access Easily comes courteousness,and it's explantion is :Kural 991 explores the virtue of accessibility and its association with goodness. It suggests that being approachable and easy to communicate with, irrespective of who the other person is, leads one to embody the virtue of goodness with ease. \n\nThis verse emphasizes the importance of being sociable and not creating barriers based on one's status, wealth, or knowledge. The virtue of goodness mentioned here refers to being kind, considerate, respectful, and understanding towards all people. When one is approachable, it indicates that they are open-minded, humble, and willing to engage with others, traits that are associated with goodness.\n\nThe concept of accessibility is highlighted as a tool for obtaining goodness. This means that by being approachable and easy to communicate with, one could cultivate a personality that is pleasing, respectful, and considerate. This, in turn, enhances their virtue of goodness, making them a better person.\n\nIn cultural context, this verse aligns with the Indian philosophy that emphasizes the importance of humility, respect for others, and the practice of treating everyone equally. It encourages us to be open and accessible to all, thereby nurturing the virtue of goodness within us. \n\nIn summary, the verse suggests that accessibility and approachability are pathways to goodness, and by being easily accessible to all, one can effortlessly embrace the virtue of goodness..The kural verse:அன்புடைமை ஆன்ற குடிப்பிறத்தல் இவ்விரண்டும்பண்புடைமை என்னும் வழக்கு. ,translates to :Humanity and noble birth Develop courtesy and moral worth,and it's explantion is :Kural 992 emphasizes the importance of two fundamental values for a person to exhibit proper behavior or conduct. These two values are affectionateness and being born in a good family. \n\nAffectionateness, or showing love and kindness towards others, is a universal virtue. It is a mark of an individual's empathy and compassion, their capacity to understand and feel the emotions of others. It is this trait that makes a person approachable, amicable, and well-loved by all. \n\nOn the other hand, being born in a good family doesn't strictly refer to high birth or noble lineage. Instead, it implies being born in a family that upholds moral values, ethics, and good conduct. Such families cultivate a nurturing environment where children are taught to be respectful, considerate, and kind from a young age. \n\nBoth these values, when combined, shape an individual's character and dictate their behavior towards others. They influence how a person interacts with the world around them, promoting harmony, understanding, and mutual respect. Therefore, this couplet argues that the manifestation of proper behavior is not just an inherent trait but a product of both inherent affectionateness and the environment provided by a good family..The kural verse:உறுப்பொத்தல் மக்களொப்பு அன்றால் வெறுத்தக்கபண்பொத்தல் ஒப்பதாம் ஒப்பு. ,translates to :Likeness in limbs is not likeness It's likeness in kind courteousness,and it's explantion is :The Kural 993 discusses the differences between physical resemblance and the resemblance of virtues or qualities. It states that a mere physical resemblance or similarity doesn't truly define a relationship or bond among individuals. Instead, it is the shared values, virtues, and qualities that create a real and meaningful connection.\n\nThis verse emphasizes that the true measure of similarity or unity should not be based on external, physical attributes which are transient and superficial, but on the internal qualities and virtues that are enduring and profound. \n\nFor instance, two individuals may look alike, but their characters and behaviours could be drastically different. Conversely, two persons may look completely different physically, but they could share common values and attitudes, making them more alike in essence.\n\nSo, the verse promotes the idea that true resemblance is not about physical attributes but about shared qualities, values, and attitudes. This concept encourages us to recognize and value the essence of a person, their character, rather than just their physical appearance. It also highlights the importance of virtues and moral values in establishing relationships and unity among individuals..The kural verse:நயனொடு நன்றி புரிந்த பயனுடையார்பண்புபா ராட்டும் உலகு. ,translates to :The world applauds those helpful men Whose actions are just and benign,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural underscores the importance of equity and charity in human character. The essence of the verse is that the world respects and praises those individuals who consistently exhibit fairness in their actions and extend kindness to others. Their character is further enhanced by their usefulness to society, which arises from their commitment to justice and their generous spirit.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse emphasizes the societal value of moral virtues. A person's worth is not measured solely by their wealth or power, but by their ethical principles and their willingness to contribute to the wellbeing of others. The world appreciates and honors those who make a positive impact through their virtuous deeds and benevolent conduct.\n\nThe verse underscores a fundamental principle of human ethics: that personal morality, expressed through fairness and generosity, is not only intrinsically valuable but also beneficial to society as a whole. It serves as a reminder that true greatness lies in service to others and adherence to principles of justice and kindness..The kural verse:நகையுள்ளும் இன்னா திகழ்ச்சி பகையுள்ளும்பண்புள பாடறிவார் மாட்டு. ,translates to :The courteous don't even foes detest For contempt offends even in jest,and it's explantion is :Kural 995 emphasizes the importance of treating everyone with respect and kindness, regardless of their status or relationship with us. The verse highlights the intrinsic value of human dignity and the pain that can be inflicted by unkind words, even when they are spoken in jest or playfulness. \n\nThis verse advises that one should always be mindful and sensitive about the feelings of others, understanding that even a light-hearted jibe can cause discomfort or distress. It underscores the wisdom of those who are aware of this and thus, maintain a decorous behavior, even towards those who may bear ill-will towards them. \n\nIn essence, the verse speaks about the virtue of maintaining one's propriety and respectfulness under all circumstances, and the wisdom in recognizing and respecting the feelings and sensitivities of others. It teaches the importance of empathy and maintaining our good manners, regardless of the behavior of others, and the potential negative impact of thoughtless words..The kural verse:பண்புடையார்ப் பட்டுண்டு உலகம் அதுஇன்றேல்மண்புக்கு மாய்வது மன். ,translates to :The world rests with the mannered best Or it crumbles and falls to dust,and it's explantion is :Kural 996 emphasizes the importance of virtuous people in maintaining the balance and harmony of the world. It suggests that the world operates smoothly and prosperously because it is associated with people who uphold good virtues, principles, and ethics. Their actions, thoughts, and words bring positivity and order, which help in the sustenance of the world.\n\nThe verse further warns that in the absence of such virtuous people, the world would descend into chaos, akin to burying itself into the earth and perishing. It implies that without the guiding light of morality and virtue, society would crumble, and the world as we know it would cease to exist.\n\nIn essence, this Kural is a reminder of the significant role that individuals with integrity and virtue play in sustaining the world. They serve as the moral compass guiding society, and without them, the world would lose its direction and collapse into disarray. This verse encourages everyone to strive to be virtuous for the betterment and survival of society and the world at large..The kural verse:அரம்போலும் கூர்மைய ரேனும் மரம்போல்வர்மக்கட்பண்பு இல்லா தவர். ,translates to :The mannerless though sharp like file Are like wooden blocks indocile,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse, Kural 997, emphasizes the importance of having true human qualities, beyond just intelligence or wisdom. It suggests that a person can have the sharpness of a file, indicating a high level of intellect or cunning, but if he lacks the essential human qualities, he is no better than a tree. \n\nThe human qualities referred to here could include empathy, kindness, compassion, fairness, and the ability to relate to other people's feelings and experiences. These are qualities that make us truly human, distinguish us from other beings, and enable us to live in society.\n\nThe comparison to a tree suggests that without these human traits, a person may be alive and present, but not truly participating or contributing to the world around him in a meaningful way. Just like a tree, he may exist, but without the ability to interact or connect with others on a deeper level.\n\nIn essence, this verse highlights the idea that intelligence or sharpness alone is not sufficient in life. To be truly human and to lead a fulfilling life, one must also possess and display the fundamental human qualities that enable us to connect with others and contribute to society..The kural verse:நண்பாற்றார் ஆகி நயமில செய்வார்க்கும்பண்பாற்றார் ஆதல் கடை. ,translates to :Discourtesy is mean indeed E'en to a base unfriendly breed,and it's explantion is :Kural 998 emphasizes the importance of maintaining one's good nature even in the face of hostility or negativity from others. It suggests that it is unwise and dishonorable to react in kind to those who bear no friendship or goodwill towards us and act hatefully. \n\nThe cultural context of this verse is deeply rooted in the Indian philosophy of \"ahimsa\" or non-violence, which goes beyond physical non-violence to include maintaining a peaceful and forgiving attitude towards those who wish us harm. \n\nIn a moral sense, the verse encourages us to uphold our values and virtues, regardless of how others behave towards us. It underlines the significance of self-restraint and patience, which are considered noble qualities. \n\nIn simpler terms, this Kural advises us not to stoop to the level of individuals who act maliciously or bear no friendship towards us. Instead, we should remain dignified, patient, and continue to exhibit our good qualities, as responding with negativity or hate would only demean our own character. \n\nThus, this verse stands as a timeless reminder that our reactions to others' behavior reflect our own character and values. It advises maintaining one's decorum and integrity, even when faced with hostility or ill-will..The kural verse:நகல்வல்லர் அல்லார்க்கு மாயிரு ஞாலம்பகலும்பாற் பட்டன்று இருள். ,translates to :To those bereft of smiling light Even in day the earth is night,and it's explantion is :Kural 999 discusses the importance of social interaction and the ability to experience joy in life. It suggests that for those who are incapable of rejoicing or engaging positively with others, their world is shrouded in darkness, even in the brightness of day.\n\nThe metaphor of darkness in daylight signifies the sorrow and loneliness that individuals may experience despite being surrounded by opportunities to engage, connect, and rejoice. It emphasizes the importance of developing strong social skills and the capacity to derive joy from interactions with others. Without this ability, one's life may feel bleak and joyless, akin to living in perpetual darkness despite the world being bathed in light. \n\nThis verse highlights the crucial role that happiness and social interaction play in our perception of the world. It encourages us to cultivate the ability to rejoice and interact positively with others, to ensure that our world is filled with light and joy, rather than darkness and solitude..The kural verse:பண்பிலான் பெற்ற பெருஞ்செல்வம் நன்பால்கலந்தீமை யால்திரிந் தற்று. ,translates to :The wealth heaped by the churlish base Is pure milk soured by impure vase,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 1000, emphasizes the importance of good character and moral integrity in the context of wealth. It metaphorically describes how great wealth amassed by a person lacking in virtue or goodness is akin to pure milk spoiled by a contaminated vessel. \n\nThe verse suggests that just as milk, regardless of its purity, will be ruined if stored in a vessel tainted by impurities, so too will wealth, no matter how large, be wasted or lose its value if it is in the hands of those devoid of moral and ethical qualities. \n\nThus, the verse underscores the idea that wealth alone is not sufficient. It must be accompanied by virtue and good character to be truly valuable and beneficial. If not, it will only lead to ruin and waste, much like the spoiled milk.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, the author of Thirukkural, is emphasizing that virtue and righteousness are more important than wealth, and one without moral values, even if they are wealthy, will eventually face downfall..The kural verse:வைத்தான்வாய் சான்ற பெரும்பொருள் அஃதுண்ணான்செத்தான் செயக்கிடந்தது இல். ,translates to :Dead is he with wealth in pile Unenjoyed, it is futile,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1001 explores the theme of wealth and the purpose it serves. It criticizes the notion of hoarding wealth without enjoying or utilizing it. The verse metaphorically describes the person who accumulates enormous wealth, but does not savor or use it, as being 'dead'. The underlying message here is to underscore the futility of such accumulation - wealth, in essence, is meant to be enjoyed and put to good use, not merely amassed for display or safeguarding. \n\nThe verse encourages a balanced approach towards wealth - it is not to be squandered recklessly, but neither is it to be hoarded excessively. The true value of wealth is derived from its utility and enjoyment, rather than its mere possession. Therefore, the verse underscores the importance of using wealth wisely for personal enjoyment, societal benefit, and overall well-being, rather than just accumulating it. It implies that a life lived without enjoying the fruits of one's labor is akin to a life unlived or a state of being 'dead'. \n\nIn the broader context of Thiru Kural's teachings, the verse also echoes the philosophy of detachment from material possessions and the need for contentment. This verse is a clear example of the timeless wisdom found in Thiru Kural, which continues to be relevant in contemporary discussions on wealth, happiness, and the purpose of life..The kural verse:பொருளானாம் எல்லாமென்று ஈயாது இவறும்மருளானாம் மாணாப் பிறப்பு ,translates to :The niggard miser thinks wealth is all He hoards, gives not is born devil,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse (Kural 1002) imparts a moral lesson about the perils of greed and miserliness. It underlines that wealth, while having the capability to provide all pleasures, should not be hoarded but used judiciously and shared generously.\n\nThe verse warns that those who recognize that wealth can cater to every desire, but choose to live a life of stinginess, are spiritually blind. They are so engrossed in their materialistic possessions that they overlook the essence of generosity and sharing. Such individuals, driven by their greed, fail to use their wealth for the benefit of others, thus denying themselves and others the joy and happiness that could be derived from it.\n\nThe verse suggests that such miserliness might lead to negative karmic consequences in the subsequent births. The usage of the term 'demon' here is metaphorical, indicating a lower, undesirable form of life that is devoid of virtues. It illustrates the concept of karma, prevalent in Hindu philosophy, where one's actions in the present life dictate the circumstances of their future lives.\n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes the importance of charity, generosity and the judicious use of wealth, and warns against the negative consequences of greed and miserliness..The kural verse:ஈட்டம் இவறி இசைவேண்டா ஆடவர்தோற்றம் நிலக்குப் பொறை. ,translates to :A burden he is to earth indeed Who hoards without a worthy deed,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural emphasizes the importance of seeking true fame and virtue over the mere accumulation of wealth. It suggests that individuals who are solely focused on wealth accumulation, without any regard for reputation or good conduct, are a burden to the earth.\n\nThe verse criticizes those who harbor an excessive desire for material wealth, to the extent of neglecting their moral responsibilities and communal respect. It argues that such people, driven by their materialistic cravings, contribute to societal imbalance and disharmony. \n\nIn essence, Thirukkural through this verse is urging individuals to strive for true fame, which is rooted in virtuous deeds and moral conduct, rather than being engrossed in the pursuit of wealth. The verse implies that a life lived with dignity, virtue and respect is more valuable than a life lived in the blind pursuit of riches. It reminds us of the ancient wisdom that wealth is transient, but a good reputation is enduring.\n\nTherefore, this Kural is a call for ethical living, reminding us that wealth should not become an obsession that overshadows our moral obligations and social responsibilities. It encourages us to strike a balance between the pursuit of material wealth and the cultivation of moral values, thereby leading a life that is beneficial not only to ourselves but also to the world around us..The kural verse:எச்சமென்று என்எண்ணுங் கொல்லோ ஒருவரால்நச்சப் படாஅ தவன். ,translates to :What legacy can he leave behind Who is for approach too unkind,and it's explantion is :Kural 1004 explores the consequences of miserliness and the lack of benevolence. In this verse, Valluvar uses a rhetorical question to underscore the repercussions of being ungenerous, especially in the context of how one will be remembered after death.\n\nThe verse says, \"What will the miser who is not liked by anyone regard as his own in the world to come?\" Here, the poet is implying that a miser, who is disliked by all due to his unwillingness to help others, will have nothing to claim as his own in the afterlife. This is because, according to the poet's worldview, our deeds and generosity in the present world determine our legacy and influence our state in the life to come.\n\nThe underlying moral lesson of this Kural is the importance of generosity and benevolence. It advises against hoarding wealth and prompts individuals to share their resources with others. This verse also hints at the concept of karma, where our actions in this world have repercussions in the next.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar suggests that the measure of a person's life is not their material wealth, but how much they have given to others. Those who live selfishly, refusing to share their wealth, will have nothing to look forward to in the afterlife, and will be remembered poorly or not at all in this world..The kural verse:கொடுப்பதூஉம் துய்ப்பதூஉம் இல்லார்க்கு அடுக்கியகோடியுண் டாயினும் இல். ,translates to :What is the good of crores they hoard To give and enjoy whose heart is hard,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1005 raises a profound philosophical point about the purpose of wealth. It asserts that those who neither share their riches with others nor derive personal joy from them are truly impoverished, no matter how vast their wealth may appear.\n\nThe underlying idea is that wealth in itself has no inherent value, but rather derives its worth from its use. This kural emphasizes the importance of generosity and enjoyment as central to a fulfilled life. It suggests that those who hoard their wealth without aiding others or indulging in personal pleasures are not truly rich. They might possess material wealth, but they lack the emotional and spiritual riches that come from sharing and self-enjoyment.\n\nThis verse also subtly underlines the futility of greed and the accumulation of wealth for its own sake. It promotes a balanced approach to wealth, where it is not just accumulated, but also enjoyed and shared, adding value to one's own life and the lives of others. The verse suggests that wealth is a means to an end, not an end in itself, and the true end is human happiness, both personally and collectively.\n\nIn a broader sense, the kural can be seen as a critique of avarice and an endorsement of a life lived in harmony with society and one's own desires. It is a reminder that the ultimate purpose of wealth is to serve as a tool for the betterment of human life, not as a hoarded treasure that brings no benefit to anyone..The kural verse:ஏதம் பெருஞ்செல்வம் தான்துவ்வான் தக்கார்க்கொன்றுஈதல் இயல்பிலா தான். ,translates to :Great wealth unused for oneself nor To worthy men is but a slur,and it's explantion is :This Kural, number 1006, addresses the nature and purpose of wealth. It suggests that the individual who neither enjoys his wealth personally nor uses it to assist those who are deserving, essentially acts as a disease to his own prosperity.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of balance in the acquisition and utilization of wealth. On one hand, it suggests that one should enjoy the fruits of their labor and wealth rather than hoarding it unnecessarily. On the other hand, it also points to the moral responsibility of the wealthy to assist those in need, particularly those who are worthy or deserving of help.\n\nBy comparing such a person to a 'disease to his wealth', Valluvar implies that such behavior is not only detrimental to the individual's personal well-being and happiness, but also to the overall health of his wealth. Just like a disease impairs the body's functions, hoarding wealth without putting it to good use impairs the wealth's potential to create value and happiness. \n\nIn essence, this verse advocates for a balanced and responsible approach to wealth management, emphasizing both personal enjoyment and social responsibility..The kural verse:அற்றார்க்கொன்று ஆற்றாதான் செல்வம் மிகநலம்பெற்றாள் தமியள்மூத் தற்று. ,translates to :Who loaths to help have-nots, his gold Is like a spinster-belle grown old,and it's explantion is :This Kural pertains to the virtue of generosity, especially towards those less fortunate. The verse metaphorically compares amassed wealth that is not used for the benefit of the needy to a beautiful woman who ages without ever being married.\n\nThe premise here is that wealth, just like beauty, is not merely for the purpose of personal possession or enjoyment. Rather, it should be used for the benefit and welfare of others, especially those who are less fortunate. In the same way, the beauty of a woman is not just for her own admiration, but it is meant to be shared and appreciated in the sanctity of marriage, and to contribute to the cycle of life.\n\nThe verse suggests that wealth that is not shared with those in need is essentially useless and frittered away, just like beauty that is not shared in a marital union is wasted as it fades with time. This resonates with the philosophy of sharing and caring, which is a cornerstone of many cultures and religions worldwide.\n\nThis Kural highlights the moral responsibility of those who are wealthy to help those in need. It implies that the true value of wealth lies not in accumulation, but in distribution for the betterment of society. Similarly, the true value of beauty lies not in vanity, but in its appreciation within the context of a loving, committed relationship. The verse encourages us to be generous and to use our resources, whether it is wealth or beauty, for the greater good..The kural verse:நச்சப் படாதவன் செல்வம் நடுவூருள்நச்சு மரம்பழுத் தற்று. ,translates to :The idle wealth of unsought men Is poison-fruit-tree amidst a town,and it's explantion is :Kural 1008 essentially conveys that the wealth of a person who is universally disliked or detested is futile and unappreciated. This verse employs the metaphor of a \"Nachu\" tree, bearing fruit in the middle of a town, to drive its point across. \n\nThe \"Nachu\" tree, often considered sacred in traditional Tamil culture, is known to bear a fruit that has a strong, unpleasant smell. Therefore, even though it's fruitful, people tend to avoid it due to its odorous nature. Similarly, a wealthy person who is generally disliked or not respected by the community around him, his wealth, despite its abundance, is not valued or appreciated. \n\nIn essence, the verse emphasizes the importance of being liked, respected, and having a good reputation in society. It suggests that wealth without respect or acceptance from society is just as unpleasant as the fruit of the \"Nachu\" tree in a town, fruitful yet repelling. It teaches us that wealth, in isolation from social acceptance and respect, loses its charm and value..The kural verse:அன்பொரீஇத் தற்செற்று அறநோக்காது ஈட்டியஒண்பொருள் கொள்வார் பிறர். ,translates to :Others usurp the shining gold In loveless, stingy, vicious hold,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 1009, emphasizes the temporary nature of material wealth and criticizes the relentless pursuit of it at the cost of love and morality. The verse suggests that those who disregard love and morality to amass wealth, causing suffering to themselves and others in the process, will eventually lose their accumulated wealth to others.\n\nThe verse stresses the importance of love and righteousness in life, and warns of the futility of greed and selfishness. It suggests that wealth obtained without consideration for others and moral values will not bring true happiness or satisfaction, but rather lead to suffering and loss. Ultimately, such ill-gotten wealth will end up in the hands of others, emphasizing the transient nature of material possessions.\n\nIn a broader context, this verse advocates for the virtues of love, compassion, and morality, and cautions against the perils of greed and selfishness. It underscores the message that prosperity should be achieved through righteousness and generosity, not at their expense..The kural verse:சீருடைச் செல்வர் சிறுதுனி மாரிவறங்கூர்ந் தனையது உடைத்து. ,translates to :The brief want of the rich benign Is like rainclouds growing thin,and it's explantion is :Kural 1010 is a metaphorical verse that speaks of the transient nature of poverty for those who are noble and wealthy. The verse uses a beautiful analogy of clouds to convey this temporary state of poverty. \n\nIn essence, the verse suggests that for individuals who are of noble character and possess wealth, a short-lived period of poverty can be likened to clouds that momentarily appear poor after having given away their wealth in the form of rain. Just as the clouds, after a brief period of emptiness, regain their capacity to shower rain, so too will these noble and wealthy individuals recover from their temporary state of poverty.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the inherent generosity and magnanimity of the wealthy and noble, likening them to clouds that nourish the earth with their rainfall. It also reinforces the idea that wealth is not fixed, but cyclical in nature, especially for those who generously share their resources. \n\nTherefore, the temporary state of poverty for such individuals is not a hardship, but rather a natural and temporary phase, much like the temporary emptiness of the rain-filled cloud. In the larger scheme of things, this temporary poverty does not diminish their nobility or richness, just as the temporary lack of rain does not diminish the cloud's capacity to bring forth rain again..The kural verse:கருமத்தால் நாணுதல் நாணுந் திருநுதல்நல்லவர் நாணுப் பிற. ,translates to :To shrink from evil deed is shame The rest is blush of fair-faced dame,and it's explantion is :Kural 1011 deals with the concept of true modesty. It suggests that true modesty arises from the fear or aversion of doing evil or immoral deeds. This form of modesty is a moral restraint that keeps one from committing wrongful actions. It is a sense of shame that arises from within, born out of a deep respect for ethical and moral codes of conduct. \n\nThe second half of the verse talks about another form of modesty, which is often seen in virtuous women. This is more of a natural bashfulness or shyness that is part of their inherent characteristics. It is a demeanor that is considered admirable and noble. However, Thiruvalluvar posits that this form of modesty, though commendable, is not as profound as the modesty that stems from the fear of doing evil.\n\nSo, the central message of this Kural is that the highest form of modesty is self-restraint from immoral actions, a moral compass that guides one through life. Any other form of modesty, such as bashfulness or shyness, though respectable, are secondary to this prime virtue. In essence, true modesty is a moral virtue, not just a social demeanor..The kural verse:ஊணுடை எச்சம் உயிர்க்கெல்லாம் வேறல்லநாணுடைமை மாந்தர் சிறப்பு. ,translates to :Food, dress and such are one for all Modesty marks the higher soul,and it's explantion is :Kural 1012 emphasizes the distinction between the common necessities of life and the virtues that set apart virtuous individuals. The verse points out that needs like food and clothing are universal, shared by all living beings. These are not what define or distinguish a person's character or moral standing. \n\nHowever, the trait of modesty or decency, as indicated in the verse, is not as universal. It is a characteristic found specifically among virtuous or morally upright individuals. Modesty here encompasses not just humility or shyness, but a broader sense of decency, including respect for others, self-restraint, and abstaining from wrongful actions. \n\nTherefore, while food, clothing, and other such necessities are common to all, it is the possession of virtues like modesty that truly distinguishes the good and sets them apart. This Kural, thus, urges individuals to aspire for these higher values and virtues, beyond just fulfilling basic physical needs..The kural verse:ஊனைக் குறித்த உயிரெல்லாம் நாண்என்னும்நன்மை குறித்தது சால்பு. ,translates to :All lives have their lodge in flesh Perfection has its home in blush,and it's explantion is :Kural 1013 delves into the concept of modesty and its relationship with perfection. Just as the body is the dwelling place of the soul, the excellence of modesty is considered the dwelling place of perfection.\n\nThe verse uses a metaphor to present modesty as the physical embodiment of perfection - much like the body is the physical embodiment of the soul. It suggests that modesty is not simply an attribute but forms the very foundation of perfection.\n\nThe concept of modesty in Thiru Kural encompasses humility, decency, and respect for others. It is seen as a virtue that brings balance to one's character and behavior. Similarly, perfection here refers to the ideal state of moral and ethical conduct.\n\nBy stating that modesty is the abode of perfection, the verse asserts that true perfection cannot be achieved without embracing modesty. It places a high value on modesty and underlines it as an essential quality towards achieving moral perfection. \n\nIn essence, this verse encourages individuals to cultivate modesty, implying that it forms the basis for moral and ethical perfection..The kural verse:அணிஅன்றோ நாணுடைமை சான்றோர்க்கு அஃதின்றேல்பிணிஅன்றோ பீடு நடை. ,translates to :Shame is the jewel of dignity Shameless swagger is vanity,and it's explantion is :Kural 1014 emphasizes the value of modesty, particularly for those of high status or nobility. The verse posits modesty as an ornament, an adornment that enhances the worth and appeal of the noble. It implies that modesty brings a certain grace and dignity, contributing to the respect and admiration the noble command from others.\n\nThe verse further cautions that in the absence of this 'ornament' of modesty, the nobility's high status and grandeur can seem overbearing and painful to others. Their otherwise impressive demeanor could be perceived as arrogance, resulting in discomfort and displeasure among those around them. \n\nIn essence, this verse underscores the importance of modesty as an essential virtue, even for the most distinguished individuals. It serves as a reminder that true nobility lies not just in high status or grand actions but in the grace of humility and the willingness to acknowledge one's own faults and limitations..The kural verse:பிறர்பழியும் தம்பழியும் நாணுவார் நாணுக்குஉறைபதி என்னும் உலகு. ,translates to :In them resides the sense of shame Who blush for their and other's blame,and it's explantion is :The verse 1015 of Thirukkural states, \"The world regards as the abode of modesty him who fears his own and other's guilt\". This Kural emphasizes the importance of modesty and accountability in one's actions. \n\nThe verse suggests that a person who is not only conscious of their own misdeeds but also empathizes with the faults of others is considered the epitome of humility. This sensitivity towards both personal and others’ faults makes them a beacon of modesty. The term 'fear' here encapsulates the concept of personal accountability and discretion. It's about being aware and considerate of one's actions and their potential repercussions on both oneself and others.\n\nIn essence, Valluvar suggests that one who possesses such conscientiousness and empathy is highly esteemed in society. They are viewed as a dwelling place of modesty, a metaphor that means they are exemplars of this virtue. This Kural implies that it's not just our actions but our sensitivity towards others' actions that defines our character and moral standing in society. It encourages self-scrutiny and empathy as essential aspects of a virtuous life..The kural verse:நாண்வேலி கொள்ளாது மன்னோ வியன்ஞாலம்பேணலர் மேலா யவர். ,translates to :The great refuse the wonder-world Without modesty's hedge and shield,and it's explantion is :Kural 1016 emphasizes the value of modesty and humility over worldly defenses or material possessions. It states that the truly great individuals choose modesty and humility as their shield, rather than relying on the materialistic defenses that the world has to offer. \n\nThe verse is a reminder that genuine greatness and nobility are not a result of worldly possessions or physical defenses, but rather they stem from character traits such as humility and modesty. It suggests that individuals who are truly great would prefer to live a life of modesty and humility, rather than seeking protection or security from the tangible aspects of the world. \n\nIt also delivers a powerful message about the impermanence and insubstantiality of material possessions, suggesting that true security and happiness lie in personal virtues and not in external factors. The verse is a call to rise above materialistic desires and to cultivate virtues like modesty and humility, which are the true marks of greatness..The kural verse:நாணால் உயிரைத் துறப்பர் உயிர்ப்பொருட்டால்நாண்துறவார் நாணாள் பவர். ,translates to :For shame their life the shame-sensed give Loss of shame they won't outlive,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse (Kural 1017) speaks of the importance and value of modesty. In this verse, Valluvar suggests that those who truly understand and embody modesty would prefer to lose their life rather than their modesty. This is because, for them, life without modesty is not worth living. This verse emphasizes the profound respect that the modest individuals have for their own dignity. They would rather forsake their life than compromise their modesty. It signifies that modesty is not just a virtue but a fundamental part of their existence. The key idea is the inextricable link between life and modesty for these individuals. The verse promotes the idea that moral virtues like modesty should be upheld, even at the cost of one's life. \n\nIn the broader cultural context, this verse reflects the values of ancient Tamil society where honor and modesty were held in high regard. It also carries a universal message about the importance of maintaining one's dignity and moral values, regardless of the circumstances one faces..The kural verse:பிறர்நாணத் தக்கது தான்நாணா னாயின்அறம்நாணத் தக்கது உடைத்து. ,translates to :Virtue is much ashamed of him Who shameless does what others shame,and it's explantion is :Kural 1018 explores the concept of personal and societal moral codes. The verse suggests that if a person conducts themselves in a manner that causes shame or embarrassment to others, and yet feels no remorse or shame in doing so, it is likely that virtue will forsake them. \n\nThis essentially talks about the social norms and moral values that keep a society functioning. Shame is seen as a social deterrent that keeps people from engaging in harmful or inappropriate behaviors. If a person disregards these societal norms, it can be seen as a reflection of their lack of virtue or moral rectitude. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse is a commentary on the importance of empathy, respect for societal norms, and the acknowledgment of the impact of our actions on others. It emphasizes the importance of personal integrity and the role of conscience in maintaining our moral compass.\n\nThe verse also underlines the concept of Karma, a fundamental principle in many Eastern philosophies, suggesting that our actions inevitably influence our character and destiny. Thus, if we act shamelessly, without regard for societal norms or the feelings of others, we risk being abandoned by virtue, which may lead to a life of regret and discontent..The kural verse:குலஞ்சுடும் கொள்கை பிழைப்பின் நலஞ்சுடும்நாணின்மை நின்றக் கடை. ,translates to :Lapse in manners injures the race Want of shame harms every good grace,and it's explantion is :Kural 1019 emphasizes the importance of manners and modesty in society. It states that the lack of manners can tarnish the reputation of one's family, implying that our actions and behaviors not only reflect on us individually but also on our family and lineage. This is a common concept in many cultures where the honor and reputation of a family is held in high regard.\n\nThe second half of the verse highlights the significance of modesty and humility for one's personal character and integrity. If one lacks modesty, it can damage their character beyond repair. Modesty is not just about being humble and respectful towards others, but it also encapsulates the idea of self-restraint, decency, and moral conduct.\n\nIn essence, this verse underscores that impropriety and immodesty can lead to the downfall of both one's family's reputation and one's personal character. Therefore, it promotes the cultivation of good manners and modesty as essential traits for maintaining social harmony and personal dignity..The kural verse:நாண்அகத் தில்லார் இயக்கம் மரப்பாவைநாணால் உயிர்மருட்டி அற்று. ,translates to :Movements of the shameless in heart Are string-led puppet show in fact,and it's explantion is :Kural 1020 delves into the moral significance of modesty and dignity in human behavior. The verse metaphorically compares people who lack modesty to marionettes, puppets manipulated by strings. Just as a puppet, devoid of life, dances to the will of the puppeteer, a person without modesty is led by their unchecked desires and whims, devoid of self-respect and moral integrity.\n\nThe essence of this verse lies in the understanding that modesty serves as an internal compass, guiding one's actions and decisions. It is an integral part of one's character, preserving dignity, and fostering respect among others. Without it, one's actions are hollow, bereft of moral grounding, becoming as aimless and manipulated as a puppet on strings. \n\nIn a broader cultural context, the Thiru Kural here emphasizes the importance of self-regulation and moral consciousness in individual behavior, a recurring theme in Tamil ethics and philosophy. By cultivating modesty, individuals can lead a life of dignity, respect, and moral integrity, avoiding the pitfalls of being controlled by unchecked desires, much like a puppet manipulated by strings..The kural verse:கருமம் செயஒருவன் கைதூவேன் என்னும்பெருமையின் பீடுடையது இல். ,translates to :No greatness is grander like Saying \\\"I shall work without slack\\\",and it's explantion is :This Kural conveys the virtue of unwavering dedication and commitment towards one's responsibilities, specifically referring to the duty of a person towards their family. The verse asserts that there is no greater honor or virtue than a person saying, \"I will persevere and not cease in my efforts to uplift my family.\"\n\nIn a broader context, this Kural emphasizes the significance of diligence and tenacity in all our endeavors. It promotes the notion that one's greatness is measured not by their successes, but by their relentless efforts and commitment to their duties, regardless of the challenges they face.\n\nThe Kural also reflects a cultural aspect of Tamil society, where familial responsibility and the overall well-being and prosperity of the family are considered paramount. It encourages an individual to take on their responsibilities with a sense of dedication and an unwavering spirit, as this is seen as the highest form of virtue. \n\nTherefore, the essence of this Thirukural verse is the importance of dedication, commitment, and perseverance towards one's duties and responsibilities. It asserts that these qualities are the true measures of a person's greatness and virtue..The kural verse:ஆள்வினையும் ஆன்ற அறிவும் எனஇரண்டின்நீள்வினையால் நீளும் குடி. ,translates to :These two exalt a noble home Ardent effort and ripe wisdom,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 1022, emphasizes the importance of consistent effort and wisdom in elevating one's family or lineage. It suggests that a family's prestige and status can be significantly enhanced when one combines relentless hard work (untiring perseverance) with deep knowledge and strategic thinking (wise contrivances).\n\nThe verse suggests that the combined power of these two qualities - persistence and intelligence - can lead to long-lasting achievements. It implies that the fruits of such labor are not limited to the individual alone but extend to their family, raising its stature in society.\n\nThe verse also hints at the societal structure of ancient Tamil society, where family lineage and reputation were of great importance. It underscores the value of diligence and wisdom in shaping not only one's destiny but also the destiny of one's family.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can also be interpreted as a guideline for success in any domain. It implies that persistent effort and wise decision-making, when combined, can lead to enduring success..The kural verse:குடிசெய்வல் என்னும் ஒருவற்குத் தெய்வம்மடிதற்றுத் தான்முந் துறும். ,translates to :When one resolves to raise his race Loin girt up God leads his ways,and it's explantion is :Kural 1023 is a testament to the virtue of hard work and the determination to uplift one's family or clan. The couplet conveys the idea that if an individual is fully committed to the betterment of his family, then divine forces or nature will come to his aid in surprising ways.\n\nThe first line, \"குடிசெய்வல் என்னும் ஒருவற்குத்\" (kudiseival ennum oruvarkuth), refers to a person who is resolved to raise his family. This person is not just concerned with his personal growth, but is determined to elevate his entire family or clan, suggesting the virtue of selflessness.\n\nThe second line, \"தெய்வம் மடிதற்றுத் தான்முந் துறும்\" (theyvam maditharuth thanmun thurum), implies that the divine or natural forces will present themselves to this person, almost as if they are clothing themselves to stand before him. This metaphorical expression highlights that such a dedicated person will receive unexpected assistance in his endeavors, perhaps in the form of opportunities, resources, or favorable circumstances.\n\nIn essence, this Kural teaches us the importance of determination and selfless hard work for the upliftment of one's family or community. It assures us that such noble intentions will not go unnoticed by the universe, and that assistance will come in various forms when one is truly committed to such a cause..The kural verse:சூழாமல் தானே முடிவெய்தும் தம்குடியைத்தாழாது உஞற்று பவர்க்கு. ,translates to :Who raise their races with ceaseless pain No need for plan; their ends will gain,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse emphasizes the importance of prompt and proactive action in the progress of one's family. The verse suggests that those who are swift and committed in their efforts to uplift their family need not deliberate or wait for the opportune moment. Success, according to this verse, is bound to follow such individuals naturally and spontaneously. \n\nIn a broader context, this verse also highlights the virtue of diligence and proactive initiative. It encourages individuals to take immediate action for the betterment of their family or community without unnecessary delay or hesitation. It underscores the idea that action, rather than deliberation, is the key to success and progress. \n\nThe verse is a timeless reminder that we should not wait for opportunities to present themselves, but rather create them through our persistent efforts and resolute determination. The moral interpretation is that success will naturally follow those who are determined to act swiftly and decisively for the good of their family or society at large..The kural verse:குற்றம் இலனாய்க் குடிசெய்து வாழ்வானைச்சுற்றமாச் சுற்றும் உலகு. ,translates to :Who keeps his house without a blame People around, his kinship claim,and it's explantion is :Kural 1025 highlights the importance of leading a virtuous and prosperous life. The verse asserts that people will naturally gravitate towards a person who has managed to uplift his family and maintain prosperity without resorting to immoral or unethical means. In essence, the verse emphasizes the virtues of honesty, integrity, and hard work.\n\nThe societal and cultural context here is crucial. In ancient Tamil society, as in many societies today, a person's character and moral conduct were often judged based on their actions. A person who was able to raise their family and prosper without engaging in dishonest means was considered highly respectable.\n\nMoreover, the verse indicates the positive ripple effect of leading such a life. When one person leads a virtuous and prosperous life, it doesn't just benefit their immediate family, but also their surrounding community. People tend to be attracted to and respect such individuals, seeking their friendship and association. This in turn fosters a society that values and encourages ethical conduct and prosperity achieved through righteous means.\n\nIn conclusion, this verse in Thiru Kural teaches us that prosperity gained through upright means attracts admiration and respect from society, underlining the importance of leading a virtuous life..The kural verse:நல்லாண்மை என்பது ஒருவற்குத் தான்பிறந்தஇல்லாண்மை ஆக்கிக் கொளல். ,translates to :Who raise their race which gave them birth Are deemed as men of manly worth,and it's explantion is :Kural 1026 explores the concept of true manliness or virtuous manhood. In this verse, Thiruvalluvar suggests that a man's worth and virtue are not determined by his physical strength, wealth, social status, or any other superficial measure. Rather, true manliness is the ability of a man to take responsibility for his family, to provide for them, and to be the pillar of support they lean on. \n\nThis notion of manliness extends beyond just providing material needs; it also includes moral leadership, nurturing, and guidance. By assuming such a role, a man brings honor not only to himself but also to the family he was born into. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar is emphasizing the moral and ethical responsibilities that come with manhood. Being a man is not just about being born male, but about embracing the duties and responsibilities that come with it, especially in the context of family and society.\n\nThis verse is a reflection of the societal norms and values of the period when Thiruvalluvar wrote the Thirukkural. It places high importance on familial responsibilities, moral leadership, and societal contribution as measures of a man's worth..The kural verse:அமரகத்து வன்கண்ணர் போலத் தமரகத்தும்ஆற்றுவார் மேற்றே பொறை. ,translates to :Like dauntless heroes in battle field The home-burden rests on the bold,and it's explantion is :Kural 1027 emphasizes the crucial role that individuals with strength and ability play within any group, whether it's a family, a community, or a nation. This concept is metaphorically compared to the role of brave warriors in a battlefield, who bear the brunt of the enemy’s attack, thereby safeguarding their own troops.\n\nIn a familial or social context, those individuals who possess the strength and capability are expected to shoulder the responsibilities and burdens, much like the warriors in a battlefield. They are the ones who protect and uplift their family or community, absorbing any hardships or difficulties that may arise. \n\nThe verse underlines the importance of leadership and responsibility. It recognizes that those who are endowed with strength, whether physical, intellectual, or moral, have a duty towards those who might not possess the same level of strength or capability. It's a call to the strong to protect and uplift the weak, reflecting a cornerstone of a compassionate and just society..The kural verse:குடிசெய்வார்க் கில்லை பருவம் மடிசெய்துமானங் கருதக் கெடும். ,translates to :No season have they who raise their race Sloth and pride will honour efface,and it's explantion is :Kural 1028 emphasizes the importance of continuous effort in elevating one's family or clan, without considering it as a burden or a task bound by time or seasons. The verse suggests that there is no right or wrong time for those who are committed to raising their family's stature; instead, the endeavor should be timeless and ceaseless.\n\nThe verse also warns against the pitfalls of indolence and false pride. The pride here refers to an inflated sense of self-dignity that prevents one from doing work that is necessary for the betterment of their family, thinking it beneath them or inappropriate to their status. This pride and indolence, according to the verse, will lead to the downfall of a family's honor. \n\nIn essence, the Kural emphasizes the virtues of continuous effort, humility, and the willingness to work towards the betterment of one's family, disregarding the constraints of time or perceived social status. It argues against laziness and false pride, as they are detrimental to the growth and prosperity of the family..The kural verse:இடும்பைக்கே கொள்கலம் கொல்லோ குடும்பத்தைக்குற்ற மறைப்பான் உடம்பு. ,translates to :Is not his frame a vase for woes Who from mishaps shields his house?,and it's explantion is :Kural 1029 discusses the sacrifices one makes to protect their family from harm and evil. The verse suggests that a person who willingly endures hardships and sufferings to prevent their family from any form of distress, is indeed performing a noble act. Their body is not only exposed to physical suffering, but also mental and emotional strain. However, the tone of the verse implies a rhetorical question, questioning if it is only suffering that such a person is exposed to, hinting at a deeper sense of fulfillment and satisfaction that may come from such selfless acts.\n\nThis verse highlights the core values of selflessness, sacrifice, and duty towards one's family, which are central to many cultures around the world. It acknowledges that protecting one's family may involve personal hardship, but implies that there is a greater reward in the form of moral satisfaction and peace.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can be extended to any form of selfless service or sacrifice one makes for the welfare of others, be it their community, society, or humanity at large. It underscores the inherent nobility and dignity in self-sacrifice for the greater good, despite the personal hardships it may entail..The kural verse:இடுக்கண்கால் கொன்றிட வீழும் அடுத்தூன்றும்நல்லாள் இலாத குடி. ,translates to :A house will fall by a mishap With no good man to prop it up,and it's explantion is :Kural 1030 delves into the significance of strong pillars within a family, particularly during times of hardship. The verse metaphorically likens a family to a tree and misfortune to an axe. Just as a tree, without robust roots and trunk, would fall under the strike of an axe, a family, without supportive members, would crumble under the weight of adversity.\n\nThe verse emphasizes how crucial it is to have individuals within a family who can face and withstand hardships. These individuals serve as a strong support system that can uphold the family during challenging times. In their absence, the family becomes vulnerable, unable to bear the brunt of misfortunes and ultimately collapses.\n\nThis kural underscores the importance of resilience, unity, and strength within a family unit. It encourages us to foster these qualities within ourselves and others in our families to ensure that our family can endure, survive, and thrive, even in the face of adversity. It also serves as a reminder of the potential consequences of neglecting these virtues - the downfall of the entire family..The kural verse:சுழன்றும்ஏர்ப் பின்னது உலகம் அதனால்உழந்தும் உழவே தலை. ,translates to :Farming though hard is foremost trade Men ply at will but ploughmen lead,and it's explantion is :Kural 1031 is a profound verse that emphasizes the importance and primacy of agriculture, despite its strenuous nature. The verse states that agriculture is the most excellent form of labor. The rationale behind this assertion is that no matter how much the world evolves and diversifies into various occupations, it eventually has to rely on the farmer for sustenance. \n\nThis verse is a testament to the fundamental role that agriculture plays in our society. Despite the advancements in technology and the emergence of various professions, the world still relies on the basic necessity provided by farming - food. This is why, despite its laborious nature, agriculture remains a principal and respected profession. \n\nThe verse also subtly underscores the nobility and resilience of farmers who, despite the strenuous nature of their work and the many challenges they face, continue to toil on the land to feed the world. \n\nIn a broader perspective, the verse teaches us the importance of recognizing and valuing the fundamental aspects of our society that sustain us, regardless of their simplicity or the hard work they entail..The kural verse:உழுவார் உலகத்தார்க்கு ஆணிஅஃ தாற்றாதுஎழுவாரை எல்லாம் பொறுத்து. ,translates to :Tillers are linch-pin of mankind Bearing the rest who cannot tend,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse (Kural 1032) emphasizes the pivotal role of farmers or agriculturists in society. It likens them to the 'linchpin' of the world, a metaphor that illustrates their fundamental importance. A linchpin is a pin that keeps the wheel in place on its axle, thus preventing it from coming off. Similarly, farmers are viewed as essential to the functioning of the world, as they support all other professions and livelihoods.\n\nThe verse acknowledges the fact that all other workers, regardless of their profession, are dependent on farmers for their sustenance. People may not be able to till the soil, but they rely on those who do for their daily food. Thus, farmers bear the responsibility of feeding the world, making their role indispensable.\n\nIn an extended interpretation, this verse could also underline the significance of agriculture as an occupation. It suggests that farming is not just another profession, but a crucial activity that holds society together. It highlights the need to respect and value the work of farmers, given their crucial role in sustaining life and livelihoods.\n\nSo, in essence, this verse is a tribute to the hard work of farmers and the fundamental role they play in maintaining the balance and sustenance of the world..The kural verse:உழுதுண்டு வாழ்வாரே வாழ்வார்மற் றெல்லாம்தொழுதுண்டு பின்செல் பவர். ,translates to :They live who live to plough and eat The rest behind them bow and eat,and it's explantion is :The verse, Kural 1033, is a profound depiction of the importance and dignity of agriculture in sustaining life. According to this verse, those who indulge in agriculture, cultivating the land and reaping its yield, are the ones who truly live a dignified life. They are self-sustaining and independent, as they rely on their own labor rather than depending on others.\n\nOn the other hand, those who do not engage in agriculture, instead relying on the produce of the farmers, lead a life of dependency. They are described as living a 'cringing' life, as they have to wait for the farmers to cultivate and harvest before they can consume. This verse is highlighting the fundamental role of farmers in society and the economy, as all other professions and livelihoods are directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture.\n\nThis verse is as relevant today as it was when it was written, reminding us of the importance of respecting and valifying farming and farmers. It underscores the value of self-sufficiency and the dignity of labor, encouraging us to appreciate the hard work of those who grow our food. It also urges us to strive for self-reliance and independence, rather than leading a life of dependency..The kural verse:பலகுடை நீழலும் தங்குடைக்கீழ்க் காண்பர்அலகுடை நீழ லவர். ,translates to :Who have the shade of cornful crest Under their umbra umbrellas rest,and it's explantion is :Kural 1034 refers to the patriotic spirit of the agricultural community. It emphasizes the deep-rooted loyalty farmers have towards their king or leader. The verse suggests that these farmers, who are the backbone of the state's economy and society, desire to see their leader's influence and control expand to cover other states as well. This isn't necessarily a wish for military conquest, but rather a testament of their faith in their leader's ability to govern justly and effectively. \n\nThe verse is a tribute to the farmers' sense of patriotism and their desire for the prosperity of their state under the leadership of their king. The Kural thus portrays farmers not only as essential contributors to the economy but also as key players in the socio-political landscape of the state. \n\nIn a broader context, this verse can be interpreted as an encouragement for unity, harmony, and efficient leadership. It's a call for leaders to be as productive and beneficial as the farmers, thereby making their rule desirable for others as well..The kural verse:இரவார் இரப்பார்க்கொன்று ஈவர் கரவாதுகைசெய்தூண் மாலை யவர். ,translates to :Who till and eat, beg not; nought hide But give to those who are in need,and it's explantion is :This Thirukkural verse (Kural 1035) extols the dignity of labor and the nobility of generosity. It refers to those individuals who live by their own hard work, earning their livelihood through manual labor. Their inherent self-respect and pride in their work prevent them from seeking charity or begging from others, no matter how difficult their circumstances might be. \n\nThis verse also highlights their compassionate nature. Despite their modest means, these hard-working individuals are willing to help those who approach them for assistance. They give without hesitation, aligning with the spirit of selfless giving, demonstrating that generosity is not about the wealth you have, but about the willingness to share whatever little you possess.\n\nIn essence, this verse is an ode to the dignity of labor, the virtue of self-reliance, and the generosity of the working class. It emphasizes that one's self-worth is not determined by their economic status, but by their values and actions..The kural verse:உழவினார் கைம்மடங்கின் இல்லை விழைவதூஉம்விட்டேம்என் பார்க்கும் நிலை. ,translates to :Should ploughmen sit folding their hands Desire-free monks too suffer wants,and it's explantion is :Kural 1036 highlights the significance of farmers and agriculture in society. The verse says, \"If the farmer's hands are slackened, even the ascetic state will fail.\" This means that if farmers stop working, even those who renounce all material possessions and worldly desires (ascetics) would find it impossible to sustain their way of life. \n\nThis Kural indirectly emphasizes the vital role of farmers as the backbone of any society or civilization. Farmers produce the food that is necessary for the survival of all, including those who have chosen a life of asceticism. Even ascetics, who have renounced all worldly pleasures, are dependent on the food produced by the farmers for their survival. \n\nTherefore, this verse underscores the importance of work and the crucial role of those who till and toil on the land. It illustrates the interdependence of different roles in society and the overarching importance of agriculture for the sustenance of life. This verse also serves as a reminder to respect and value the labor of farmers, as their work is fundamental to the survival and progress of society. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse could also be interpreted as a call to appreciate the value of hard work and the contributions of those who perform it, regardless of the nature of their work. It serves as a reminder that every role is important for the functioning and survival of society..The kural verse:தொடிப்புழுதி கஃசா உணக்கின் பிடித்தெருவும்வேண்டாது சாலப் படும். ,translates to :Moulds dried to quarter-dust ensure Rich crops without handful manure,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural, written by the ancient Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, emphasizes the importance of meticulous preparation and hard work in achieving successful results. \n\nThe verse metaphorically uses the farming process to illustrate this concept. It suggests that if a farmer ploughs the land thoroughly, reducing every ounce of earth to a quarter of its size, the soil will be so well-prepared that it can yield a plentiful crop even without the addition of any manure. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can be applied to any endeavor in life. It suggests that if we prepare thoroughly and put in the hard work initially, we will be able to achieve fruitful results, even without additional resources or advantages. It underscores the importance of diligent preparation, meticulous work, and the value of self-sufficiency.\n\nThis verse also reflects a fundamental principle of the ancient Tamil agricultural society, where diligent preparation of the land was considered the key to a prosperous harvest. This wisdom is still applicable today in various fields, including education, career development, and personal growth..The kural verse:ஏரினும் நன்றால் எருவிடுதல் கட்டபின்நீரினும் நன்றதன் காப்பு. ,translates to :Better manure than plough; then weed; Than irrigating, better guard,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse emphasizes the importance of various stages in the process of agriculture and suggests a hierarchy in terms of their significance. It emphasizes that each action in the cultivation process holds its own importance, yet some actions contribute more significantly to the crop's growth and yield.\n\nThe first line, \"Manuring is better than ploughing\", indicates the significance of fertilizing the soil over the physical act of tilling the land. Here, Valluvar suggests that enriching the soil with nutrients (manuring) is more beneficial for the crops than the mere act of preparing the land (ploughing). This highlights the importance of nourishing the soil to ensure a healthy growth environment for the plants.\n\nThe second line, \"after weeding, watching is better than watering\", brings attention to the care and maintenance of the crop after it has been planted. It suggests that after the process of removing unwanted plants or weeds (weeding), vigilance or monitoring the field (watching) is more vital than irrigation (watering). This underlines the importance of protecting the crop from pests, diseases, or other potential threats. \n\nSo, the verse teaches us not only about methods of effective farming, but also metaphorically, it tells us that in life, preparation and maintenance are crucial, but so is ensuring the right environment and providing ongoing protection and care..The kural verse:செல்லான் கிழவன் இருப்பின் நிலம்புலந்துஇல்லாளின் ஊடி விடும். ,translates to :If landsmen sit sans moving about The field like wife will sulk and pout,and it's explantion is :Kural 1039 emphasizes the importance of personal involvement and attention in owning and cultivating land. It uses the metaphor of a relationship between a husband and wife to highlight its message. Just as a wife may grow resentful and distant if her husband neglects her, so too will the land yield no pleasure or produce if the owner does not take personal care and effort in its cultivation.\n\nIn the context of farming, the kural suggests that the farmer who fails to attend to his land daily, who does not devote time and effort in nurturing it, will find the land unproductive and unresponsive, much like a neglected wife who withdraws her affection. \n\nThe moral lesson here is that, just as personal attention and care are essential in maintaining a healthy and productive relationship in a marriage, the same principles apply to farming or any endeavor. Personal involvement, care, and regular attention are critical to success and productivity. \n\nThis verse also underscores the intimate connection between a farmer and his land, suggesting that the land is not just a possession, but a partner demanding respect, attention, and care. The comparison with a wife symbolizes the land's inherent fertility and productivity, which can only be realized through sustained effort and care. \n\nIn a broader sense, the kural implies that one cannot reap benefits from any venture without investing time, effort, and personal involvement. It serves as a reminder that success in any field requires dedication, hard work, and consistent attention..The kural verse:இலமென்று அசைஇ இருப்பாரைக் காணின்நிலமென்னும் நல்லாள் நகும். ,translates to :Fair good earth will laugh to see Idlers pleading poverty,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural conveys a profound message about the significance of hard work and the futility of idle living. The verse metaphorically refers to Earth as a maiden, who laughs at those who claim to live in poverty while leading an indolent life.\n\nThe Earth, in this verse, represents productivity and abundance. It is abundant with resources and constantly works to nourish and support life. When it observes individuals who, despite having access to its resources, choose to lead idle lives under the guise of poverty, it laughs. This laughter is not one of mockery but irony. It's a symbolic expression of the Earth's abundant generosity and the folly of those who, despite such abundance, refuse to make an effort to improve their conditions.\n\nThis verse imparts a moral lesson that poverty is not just a material state but also a state of mind. If people are willing to work and utilize the resources available to them, they can overcome their circumstances. But those who remain idle, blaming their poverty, are only fooling themselves. The Earth with its plentiful resources is ready to reward those who are willing to put in effort and work. It is a reminder of the saying, \"God helps those who help themselves.\" \n\nSo, in essence, this verse encourages diligence, industriousness, and self-reliance while highlighting the futility and foolishness of idle living..The kural verse:இன்மையின் இன்னாதது யாதெனின் இன்மையின்இன்மையே இன்னா தது. ,translates to :What gives more pain than scarcity? No pain pinches like poverty,and it's explantion is :Kural 1041 delves into the hardship of poverty. The verse asserts that there is no affliction as severe and distressing as poverty itself. When asked what could be worse than the state of being deprived or lacking resources, the verse emphatically responds that it is poverty again. \n\nIn other words, this verse accentuates the profound difficulties and challenges that poverty can impose on a person's life. It underscores that the state of being financially deprived surpasses any other hardships, emphasizing the importance of financial stability and economic self-sufficiency. \n\nPoverty is not just about the absence of wealth but also the deprivation of opportunities, choices, and the ability to lead a dignified life. The verse, thus, serves as a strong reminder of the detrimental effects of poverty and the importance of addressing it for social well-being and harmony..The kural verse:இன்மை எனவொரு பாவி மறுமையும்இம்மையும் இன்றி வரும். ,translates to :The sinner Want is enemy dire Of joys of earth and heaven there,and it's explantion is :Kural 1042 confronts the harsh reality of poverty, highlighting its debilitating impact on both the present and the future. The verse paints poverty as a malevolent force that not only deprives one of current joy and comfort, but also steals away the potential for future happiness. \n\nIn the Tamil context, poverty is often viewed as a wicked entity, something that induces a state of 'inmai' or lack, which subsequently leads to suffering. This suffering is not limited to the physical realm, but extends to the emotional and spiritual spheres as well, depriving one of peace and tranquility.\n\nThe verse underscores the importance of economic stability and prosperity for overall wellbeing. It suggests that without material resources, one cannot enjoy the pleasures of life in the present nor can they look forward to a hopeful, blissful future. Consequently, the verse advocates for social and economic structures that prevent the occurrence of poverty, thus enabling individuals to lead fulfilling lives both in the present and the future. \n\nIn essence, Kural 1042 underscores the profound distress caused by poverty and underscores the need for its eradication to ensure the holistic wellbeing of individuals..The kural verse:தொல்வரவும் தோலும் கெடுக்கும் தொகையாகநல்குரவு என்னும் நசை. ,translates to :The craving itch of poverty Kills graceful words and ancestry,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural discusses the destructive impact of extreme poverty, particularly when it is paired with an insatiable desire for more. It states that such conditions can obliterate the pride of one's ancestry and the dignity of one's speech.\n\nThe 'greatness of one's ancient descent' refers to the respect and prestige associated with an individual's lineage or family background. This could be due to noble ancestry, achievements of the forefathers, or a long-standing reputation for virtue and honor. The 'dignity of one's speech' signifies the respect gained through one's words, wisdom, and eloquence.\n\nThe verse suggests that when a person is excessively consumed by poverty and the associated constant craving for more, it can tarnish the prestige of their lineage and negatively impact their speech. This happens because, in their desperation, they might resort to actions or words that are not in line with the honor of their ancestry or the dignity of their speech.\n\nIn essence, this verse is a caution against the potential damage caused by severe poverty and uncontrolled desire. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining dignity and honor, regardless of one's financial condition. It also serves as a reminder of how one's actions and words can either uphold or tarnish the reputation inherited from ancestors..The kural verse:இற்பிறந்தார் கண்ணேயும் இன்மை இளிவந்தசொற்பிறக்கும் சோர்வு தரும். ,translates to :Want makes even good familymen Utter words that are low and mean,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse 1044 emphasizes the negative impact of poverty, even on individuals of noble birth. The verse suggests that poverty can lead to a state of desperation where one may resort to using derogatory or mean words, which is considered a fault or a downfall. \n\nThe verse highlights the societal pressure and the loss of dignity that comes with poverty. It is a reflection on how financial stability is crucial to uphold one's decorum and social status, irrespective of their noble birth or high lineage. The emphasis here is on the fact that nobility is not just a matter of birth, but it's also about maintaining dignity through decent conduct, which can be compromised in times of poverty.\n\nThis verse also serves as a reminder that one's words reflect their circumstances and inner state. Therefore, it's important to be empathetic and understanding towards those who may resort to such behavior due to their dire conditions. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, through this verse, portrays the harsh reality of poverty and its capacity to strip away even a noble person's elegance, pushing them to utter mean words..The kural verse:நல்குரவு என்னும் இடும்பையுள் பல்குரைத்துன்பங்கள் சென்று படும். ,translates to :The pest of wanton poverty Brings a train of misery,and it's explantion is :This verse of Thirukkural, Kural 1045, vividly depicts the profound misery that poverty can bring upon an individual. The verse underscores the idea that poverty, a significant hardship in itself, does not come alone but brings along a series of other miseries. These could be in the form of physical hardships, psychological stress, societal discrimination, or even deprivation of basic human rights.\n\nThe verse serves as a stark reminder about the overarching implications of poverty, which extend beyond mere lack of resources. It suggests that poverty is a breeding ground for various other problems, thereby making it a complex issue that impacts every aspect of an individual's life. \n\nThis Kural essentially calls for a compassionate understanding of the plight of those in poverty and underscores the need for societal efforts to alleviate this condition, as it is not just an economic problem but a humanitarian one that affects the overall wellbeing of an individual..The kural verse:நற்பொருள் நன்குணர்ந்து சொல்லினும் நல்கூர்ந்தார்சொற்பொருள் சோர்வு படும். ,translates to :The poor men's words are thrown away Though from heart good things they say,and it's explantion is :Kural 1046 explores the social bias in acknowledging wisdom and intellect, emphasizing how societal status or wealth can influence the reception and acceptance of one's words or ideas. It conveys that even if the words spoken by someone are intellectually profound and clearly articulated, they may not be appreciated or taken seriously if they come from a person who is economically impoverished. This societal bias leads to the disregard of potentially beneficial ideas and wisdom due to the speaker's lack of wealth or status. The Kural thus subtly critiques the societal norms that associate wisdom and respectability with wealth, reminding us that intellectual richness is not equivalent to material wealth..The kural verse:அறஞ்சாரா நல்குரவு ஈன்றதா யானும்பிறன்போல நோக்கப் படும். ,translates to :Even the mother looks as stranger The poor devoid of character,and it's explantion is :Kural 1047 deals with the harsh reality of extreme poverty and societal perception. The verse states that when a person slips into the abyss of destitution, devoid of righteousness, even their own mother would regard them as a stranger. \n\nThe emphasis here is not necessarily on the literal maternal relationship, but more on the perception of society and close relations. In the Tamil culture, a mother symbolizes unconditional love, compassion, and forgiveness. If even a mother, who is usually the last person to abandon her child, starts perceiving her child as a stranger, it indicates the immense degradation that poverty can cause in a person's social standing.\n\nMoreover, it underlines the unfortunate reality that society often measures a person's worth by their wealth and material possessions. The 'unrighteous poverty' mentioned in the verse refers to poverty that is not born out of misfortune, but due to the individual's lack of moral character and discipline.\n\nThus, the kural advises maintaining moral integrity and character, regardless of one's economic standing, as these virtues are valued more than wealth in a righteous society. It also subtly critiques societal norms that measure a person's worth based on their wealth or lack thereof..The kural verse:இன்றும் வருவது கொல்லோ நெருநலும்கொன்றது போலும் நிரப்பு. ,translates to :The killing Want of yesterday Will it pester me even to-day?,and it's explantion is :Kural 1048 delves into the experience of those living in poverty. It expresses the dread and despair of a person who has suffered the harsh blows of poverty the day before and wakes up with the fear of facing the same brutal circumstances again today. The verse portrays poverty as a relentless tormentor, almost akin to a murderer, that caused immense pain and suffering the previous day. The lingering question, \"Will it come again today?\" illustrates the constant anxiety and uncertainty that poverty inflicts on an individual.\n\nThis verse not only highlights the severity of impoverishment, but it also emphasizes the desperate need for solutions to alleviate such severe hardships. The plea for respite from relentless poverty is a call to society to take responsibility and address this pressing issue. The verse underscores the moral obligation of society to uplift those in destitution and ensure a life of dignity for all. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, through this verse, is calling for compassion, empathy, and action to eradicate poverty and the distress it brings..The kural verse:நெருப்பினுள் துஞ்சலும் ஆகும் நிரப்பினுள்யாதொன்றும் கண்பாடு அரிது. ,translates to :One may sleep in the midst of fire In want a wink of sleep is rare,and it's explantion is :The verse 1049 of Thirukkural states, \"One may sleep in the midst of fire; but by no means in the midst of poverty.\" \n\nThis verse metaphorically contrasts the hardships of extreme poverty with sleeping amidst fire. Thiruvalluvar, the author, suggests that it's easier for a person to find rest even in the most uncomfortable of situations, such as amidst fire, than it is in poverty. \n\nThe fire here can be seen as a symbol for any physical discomfort or danger, implying that a strong-willed person can endure physical hardships with courage and resilience. They can adapt, survive, and even find peace amidst these challenges. \n\nOn the contrary, poverty is portrayed as a condition that is far more difficult to endure. It's not just about the absence of financial resources, but also the associated hardships - hunger, social stigma, constant worry, and the feeling of helplessness. These mental and emotional distresses make it almost impossible for one to find peace or rest, making poverty a state harder to endure than even the severest of physical discomforts.\n\nSo, the essence of this Kural is to highlight the severity of poverty and to inspire empathy and understanding towards those suffering from it. The Kural also indirectly emphasizes the importance of economic stability and welfare in society..The kural verse:துப்புர வில்லார் துவரத் துறவாமைஉப்பிற்கும் காடிக்கும் கூற்று. ,translates to :Renounce their lives the poor must Or salt and gruel go to waste,and it's explantion is :Kural 1050 explores the state of extreme poverty, where individuals are unable to meet even their basic needs, such as food and water. Despite their dire circumstances, these individuals do not renounce their bodies, meaning they continue to exist and hope for survival rather than succumbing to despair or choosing to end their lives.\n\nThe verse goes on to suggest that their survival is dependent on the goodwill of their neighbors, symbolized by the consumption of the neighbor's salt and water. Salt and water here are metaphors for the most basic necessities of life that they are unable to afford themselves. \n\nThe Kural emphasizes the harsh reality of poverty and the struggle for survival that it entails. It also highlights the importance of empathy and generosity towards those less fortunate, as their survival could depend on such acts of kindness. It serves as a reminder of the social responsibility we all carry to help those in need. \n\nThe verse also subtly criticizes those who, despite being in such a desperate state, do not strive to change their circumstances. It suggests that their reliance on others for survival is a form of shame, and encourages self-reliance and effort to improve one's situation..The kural verse:இரக்க இரத்தக்கார்க் காணின் கரப்பின்அவர்பழி தம்பழி அன்று. ,translates to :Demand from those who can supply Default is theirs when they deny,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 1051, from the Thirukkural focuses on the moral dimensions of begging and giving.\n\nIn this verse, Valluvar suggests that it is permissible for a person to beg, but only from those who are capable of giving. When you appeal to someone who has the means to give, and they refuse, the burden of wrongdoing falls not on the one who asks, but on the one who withholds. \n\nThis verse highlights the moral obligation of those who are capable of giving but choose not to do so. It underscores the idea that the act of withholding, especially when one has the capacity to give, is seen as a moral failure. It also emphasizes that the act of begging is not shameful when the person is genuinely in need and asks for help from those who are capable of giving.\n\nIn highlighting this, Valluvar draws attention to the importance of generosity and compassion in society. He suggests that those with the means to help others should do so willingly, and if they don’t, the moral blame lies with them, not with those who ask. It is a call to empathy and understanding towards the less fortunate, urging those with means to share their resources with those in need..The kural verse:இன்பம் ஒருவற்கு இரத்தல் இரந்தவைதுன்பம் உறாஅ வரின். ,translates to :Even demand becomes a joy When the things comes without annoy,and it's explantion is :Kural 1052 explores the emotional dynamics involved in the act of giving and receiving. It suggests that even the act of begging, which is usually seen as a demeaning or distressing activity, can be experienced as pleasurable if the object of need is received without causing any discomfort or distress to the giver.\n\nThe verse emphasizes on the emotional state of both parties involved - the giver and the receiver. It highlights the importance of empathy and understanding in a transaction, even when it's about begging. If the receiver can obtain what he needs without causing any grief to the giver, then the act of obtaining itself becomes a source of happiness.\n\nThis Kural encourages us to consider the feelings of others in all our interactions. It inspires us to ensure that our needs and desires do not cause inconvenience or distress to others. This is a profound lesson in empathy, respect, and human dignity which holds relevance even today.\n\nIn broader perspective, this verse can also be interpreted as a commentary on social welfare, where it advocates for a society where necessities are provided to those in need without causing distress or discomfort to those who give. It promotes a compassionate society where sharing and caring is the norm, and where the act of giving, even to the extent of begging, can be a source of joy rather than a cause of distress or shame..The kural verse:கரப்பிலா நெஞ்சின் கடனறிவார் முன்நின்றுஇரப்புமோ ரேஎர் உடைத்து. ,translates to :Request has charm form open hearts Who know the duty on their part,and it's explantion is :Kural 1053 discusses the nobility and grace inherent in seeking help from those who are generous and understand their duty towards those in need. It signifies that there is a certain dignity in humbly asking for assistance from individuals who are not only charitable, but also comprehend their moral obligation to aid those less fortunate. \n\nThe verse emphasizes that the act of begging is not necessarily degrading, but can be seen as an act of courage and humility when directed towards the right people. It's a testament to the strength of the human spirit, willing to endure hardship and embarrassment in order to survive or improve one's condition.\n\nMoreover, it subtly underscores the nobility of those who give willingly and understand their societal role and responsibility. They are not merely donors, but individuals who comprehend the cycle of giving and receiving, and their part in maintaining the societal balance.\n\nIn essence, this Kural emphasizes the beauty of interdependence within society and the grace and dignity inherent in both giving and receiving, thus providing a nuanced perspective on the concept of begging and charity..The kural verse:இரத்தலும் ஈதலே போலும் கரத்தல்கனவிலும் தேற்றாதார் மாட்டு. ,translates to :Like giving even asking seems From those who hide not even in dreams,and it's explantion is :Kural 1054 expounds on the virtue of generosity and the dignity of asking from the right people. The verse suggests that begging from those who never contemplate withholding their charity, even in their dreams, is equivalent to the act of giving. This is because such individuals are characterized by their boundless generosity and lack of miserliness. \n\nThe essence of this Kural is not about the act of begging, but the nobility associated with giving. It emphasizes the magnanimity of individuals who are so generous that the concept of withholding doesn't even occur to them, even in their dreams. \n\nWhen someone seeks help from such magnanimous individuals, it is a gesture of honor and respect to their generosity. It is compared to the act of giving because when one begs from a generous person, they are facilitating the act of giving, which is a virtuous deed. \n\nIn essence, this Kural beautifully encapsulates the virtue of generosity and the inherent dignity in seeking help from the right people. It underscores the notion that the act of giving is a virtue and that seeking assistance from those who are willing to give freely is an act of respect towards their virtue..The kural verse:கரப்பிலார் வையகத்து உண்மையால் கண்ணின்றுஇரப்பவர் மேற்கொள் வது. ,translates to :The needy demand for help because The world has men who don't refuse,and it's explantion is :Kural 1055 is a reflection on the duality of the world and the interdependence of different individuals on each other. The verse emphasizes the existence of both the givers and the takers in society, each playing a pivotal role in maintaining the equilibrium.\n\nThe first half of the verse acknowledges the existence of people who are generous enough to give without hesitation or refusal. These are the individuals who do not withhold what they have, sharing it freely with those in need. This act is not limited by their personal resources but is driven by their innate kindness and empathy.\n\nThe second half of the verse focuses on the fact that because such generous souls exist, there are also those who, out of necessity, choose to beg. This is not a choice made out of laziness but a circumstance born out of need. The beggars, by standing silently in front of the givers, make a humble request for aid, relying on the kindness of the givers.\n\nIn essence, this Thiru Kural verse is a poignant commentary on the dichotomy of life, highlighting the existence of both selfless givers and those who are in dire need. It encourages empathy and generosity, reminding us of the interdependence of different sectors of society. This verse also highlights the moral responsibility of those who have resources to share them with those who don't, thereby fostering a balanced and compassionate society..The kural verse:கரப்பிடும்பை யில்லாரைக் காணின் நிரப்பிடும்பைஎல்லாம் ஒருங்கு கெடும். ,translates to :The pain of poverty shall die Before the free who don't deny,and it's explantion is :This Thirukkural verse 1056 highlights the virtue of generosity, and the transformative power it holds over the circumstances of those who are less fortunate. \n\nThe verse conveys that when one encounters individuals who are free from the vice of withholding or refusing help to those in need, all the hardships associated with poverty and begging will diminish. These individuals, driven by their generosity and benevolence, are capable of eradicating the pain of those forced into begging as a means of survival. \n\nThe verse emphasizes the moral responsibility of those who are more fortunate to not turn a blind eye towards those in need. It suggests that generosity can bring about profound change in society, uplifting those who are burdened by poverty and struggle. \n\nEssentially, the verse underscores the transformative power of generosity and how it can alleviate suffering, while subtly criticizing those who hold back their resources from those who need them the most. It advocates for empathy, compassion and generosity as essential virtues in creating a more equal and compassionate society..The kural verse:இகழ்ந்தெள்ளாது ஈவாரைக் காணின் மகிழ்ந்துள்ளம்உள்ளுள் உவப்பது உடைத்து. ,translates to :When givers without scorn impart A thrill of delight fills the heart,and it's explantion is :Kural 1057 addresses the context of charity and the dignity of the receiver. It highlights the psychological effect on the less fortunate when they encounter benevolent individuals who give without disdain or disrespect.\n\nThe verse suggests that those in need feel immense joy when they encounter benefactors who give with kindness and without any form of condescension or disrespect. This act of sincere giving brings profound satisfaction and happiness to the recipient. It resonates deeply within them, providing not just material relief but also emotional and psychological comfort. The verse emphasizes the importance of preserving the dignity of the recipient while giving.\n\nThe joy experienced by the recipient is not just because of the material aid they receive, but also due to the respect and kindness they are treated with. It underlines the fact that the manner of giving is as important as the act of giving itself. It reminds us that when we give, we should do so with grace, compassion, and without any sense of superiority or contempt. \n\nThis verse teaches us about the deeper dimensions of charity, highlighting the effects of our attitude towards those we help. It tells us that charity is not just about giving material goods or monetary help, but also about providing dignity, respect, and kindness to those in need..The kural verse:இரப்பாரை இல்லாயின் ஈர்ங்கண்மா ஞாலம்மரப்பாவை சென்றுவந் தற்று. ,translates to :This grand cool world shall move to and fro Sans Askers like a puppet show,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural speaks about the significance of compassion and charity in the world. It metaphorically states that if there were no beggars or needy people to whom one could show kindness and charity, then life in this vast, beautiful world would be as meaningless as the motions of a puppet manipulated by strings. \n\nThe puppet, despite its movements, is devoid of any genuine feelings or emotions. Similarly, if there are no opportunities to express our compassion and share our resources with those less fortunate, our lives, regardless of how rich or fulfilling they seem, would be hollow and devoid of true humanity.\n\nThis verse urges us to acknowledge the existence of poverty and suffering, not as a blight, but as an opportunity to express our kindness and compassion. It implies that charity is not just a moral duty but a vital aspect that infuses our life with meaning and purpose.\n\nThe verse also subtly emphasizes on the interconnectedness of our lives. It implies that the well-being of the individual is linked to the welfare of the society, and that the act of giving is as beneficial to the giver as it is to the receiver. \n\nIn sum, this verse from Thiru Kural teaches us that charity and compassion are not mere virtues, but essential components of a meaningful and fulfilling life..The kural verse:ஈவார்கண் என்னுண்டாம் தோற்றம் இரந்துகோள்மேவார் இலாஅக் கடை. ,translates to :Where stands the glory of givers Without obligation seekers?,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 1059, from the Thirukkural, underlines the interdependence and reciprocal relationship between the giver and the receiver.\n\nThe verse reads, \"What (praise) would there be to givers (of alms) if there were no beggars to ask for and receive (them)\". This means that the act of giving and the honor that comes with it is dependent on the existence of those who are in need and ready to receive. Without someone to receive, the act of giving, and the honor associated with it, becomes meaningless.\n\nIn a broader context, it implies the importance of humility and understanding that the act of giving is not just about the giver, but also about the recipient. It's not just about enhancing the self-image of the giver, but also about fulfilling a need in society. \n\nIt encourages us to view the act of giving not as a one-way transaction but as a mutual relationship, where the giver should be grateful for the opportunity to give and help others. It reminds us that the act of giving not only benefits the receiver but also enriches the giver, and so the giver should not look down on the receiver but be thankful for them..The kural verse:இரப்பான் வெகுளாமை வேண்டும் நிரப்பிடும்பைதானேயும் சாலும் கரி. ,translates to :The needy should not scowl at \\\"No\\\" His need another's need must show * Saint valluvar talks of two kinds of Asking:() Asking help for public causes or enterprises () Begging when one is able to work and this is condemned,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes on the disposition one should maintain when asking for help or begging. It underscores the importance of humility and patience in times of need. The verse says that a person who begs or asks for help should not feel anger or resentment if the help is denied. The reason being, their own state of poverty or need itself should serve as a reminder that others might also be in a similar situation and unable to help. \n\nThe verse also subtly reminds us of the uncertainty and unpredictability of life, where one's circumstances can change rapidly. It encourages empathy and understanding towards those who are unable to lend a hand. \n\nIn essence, this Thiru Kural verse teaches us humility, patience, and empathy, reminding us to be understanding of others' circumstances, especially when we are in need. It is a moral lesson on maintaining a composed and empathetic demeanor, even in times of distress and need..The kural verse:கரவாது உவந்தீயும் கண்ணன்னார் கண்ணும்இரவாமை கோடி உறும். ,translates to :Not to beg is billions worth E'en from eye-like friends who give with mirth,and it's explantion is :Kural 1061 emphasizes the virtue of self-reliance and the dignity of not begging, even from those who are generous and willing to give without hesitation. The couplet advocates for maintaining self-respect and independence, asserting that not resorting to begging from even the most magnanimous people will yield immense benefits.\n\nIn this Kural, Valluvar personifies the commendable individuals as 'those with eyes', suggesting their open-heartedness and clarity of vision in understanding the needs of others. They are willing to donate without hiding anything, reflecting their pure intentions and benevolent nature.\n\nHowever, Valluvar states that it is still of great merit not to beg or ask for help from these individuals. The value of self-reliance, of being able to stand on one's own feet without seeking external aid, is portrayed as something that brings immense good, equivalent to any wealth.\n\nThis Kural doesn't just talk about physical begging but also implies the importance of emotional independence. Not relying on others for happiness, validation, or emotional support is as important as not being financially dependent. \n\nIn essence, this Kural teaches the lofty ideal of self-sufficiency, underscoring the fact that personal dignity and self-reliance are virtues that outshine even the generosity of the most charitable individuals. It encourages us to strive for self-sufficiency and to value the dignity of not being a burden to others..The kural verse:இரந்தும் உயிர்வாழ்தல் வேண்டின் பரந்துகெடுக உலகியற்றி யான். ,translates to :Let World-Maker loiter and rot If \\\"beg and live\\\" be human fate,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural is a commentary on the harsh realities of life, specifically on the state of poverty and begging. Valluvar, the poet, uses a strong metaphor to express his disdain for a world where some individuals are forced to beg for their survival. \n\nIn this kural, he states that if the creator of the world has designated begging as a way of life for some people, then the creator himself should experience the suffering of begging and the subsequent downfall. This is a profound expression of empathy towards the underprivileged and a critique of the societal structure that allows such disparity. \n\nThe poet essentially condemns a world order that necessitates begging as a means of survival. He criticizes the creator for allowing such inequality and hardship to exist. His words serve as a call to action to alleviate such conditions and strive for a world where everyone has access to basic needs without having to degrade themselves. \n\nThe underlying moral lesson here is the importance of empathy, understanding the struggles of the less fortunate, and the necessity to work towards a more equitable society. This verse highlights the poet's commitment to social justice and his belief in the dignity and worth of every human being..The kural verse:இன்மை இடும்பை இரந்துதீர் வாமென்னும்வன்மையின் வன்பாட்ட தில். ,translates to :Nothing is hard like hard saying \\\"We end poverty by begging\\\",and it's explantion is :Kural 1063 is a potent commentary on the detrimental effects of begging as a solution to poverty. The verse highlights the importance of self-reliance and affirms the virtue of hard work.\n\nThe verse basically states that there is no greater foolishness than the audacity to try to alleviate the hardships of poverty by resorting to begging rather than working towards improving one's condition. It underscores the idea that begging, rather than being an effective solution, actually compounds the problem as it fosters dependency and erodes one's dignity.\n\nThe cultural context of this verse is rooted in the traditional Indian ethos that values self-reliance, hard work, and dignity of labor. It encourages one to strive to overcome their challenges through their own efforts rather than relying on handouts.\n\nIn terms of morality, the verse is a call to uphold one's dignity and self-respect, even in the face of adversity. It discourages the act of begging and promotes self-effort and perseverance as a means to overcome poverty. It also subtly critiques societal norms that may enable begging, reminding readers of the importance of creating opportunities for everyone to be self-sufficient.\n\nIn short, this verse is a powerful exhortation against begging as a solution to poverty, emphasizing instead on the virtues of self-reliance and hard work..The kural verse:இடமெல்லாம் கொள்ளாத் தகைத்தே இடமில்லாக்காலும் இரவொல்லாச் சால்பு. ,translates to :All space is small before the great Who beg not e'en in want acute,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the nobility of self-reliance and the refusal to beg, even in the face of dire circumstances. It extols the virtue of maintaining one's dignity and self-respect, irrespective of the hardships one is going through.\n\nThe verse asserts that even the vastness of the world is insufficient to fully appreciate and honor the dignity of an individual who would not, under any circumstances, resort to begging. This dignity, the verse suggests, is a wealth that remains unconquerable and beyond measure, even if all the world's wealth were to be amassed.\n\nThe cultural context here is deeply rooted in the ancient Tamil values of self-respect and self-sufficiency. It reflects the Tamil moral principle that one should strive to be self-reliant and not depend on others for their livelihood, even in times of extreme poverty or adversity. This insistence on self-reliance is seen as a mark of true nobility and dignity.\n\nThe moral interpretation of this verse is that it is a call for resilience and determination in the face of adversity. It encourages individuals to uphold their self-dignity, reminding them that this inner strength and self-respect are invaluable, far outweighing any material wealth. It is a powerful reminder that one's self-worth is not determined by external circumstances but by one's inner character and principles..The kural verse:தெண்ணீர் அடுபுற்கை ஆயினும் தாள்தந்ததுஉண்ணலின் ஊங்கினிய தில். ,translates to :Though gruel thin, nothing is sweet Like the food earned by labour's sweat,and it's explantion is :Kural 1065 is a profound verse that underscores the value of self-earned sustenance and the dignity of labour. The verse essentially conveys that even a simple meal, like a thin gruel, becomes incredibly satisfying when it is earned through one's own efforts. \n\nIn the verse, the thin gruel (a simple, watery dish) symbolizes a bare minimum or modest living. But even this minimalistic lifestyle becomes immensely satisfying and enriching when the means to afford it comes from one's own hard work. It underlines the idea that the taste of the food is less important than the satisfaction of having earned it through honest labour. \n\nThis verse highlights the core value of self-reliance and the ethics of earning one's own living rather than depending on others. The joy and satisfaction that come from consuming something that you have worked hard for, no matter how simple or basic it may be, cannot be compared to anything else. This principle promotes humility, hard work, and a sense of personal accomplishment.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse is not just about food or physical sustenance. It can be applied to any endeavour or achievement in life. The fulfilment that comes from achieving something through personal effort is more gratifying than receiving it without any effort. \n\nOverall, Thirukkural 1065 champions the virtue of self-reliance and the dignity of labour, asserting that the fruits of one's own labour, however modest they may be, bring the greatest satisfaction..The kural verse:ஆவிற்கு நீரென்று இரப்பினும் நாவிற்குஇரவின் இளிவந்த தில். ,translates to :It may be water for the cow Begging tongue is mean anyhow,and it's explantion is :This kural, verse 1066, emphasizes the disgrace associated with begging, even when it is intended for a noble cause like quenching the thirst of a cow. In the Tamil culture, cows are considered sacred and providing for their needs is seen as an act of virtue. Yet, Thiruvalluvar, the author of Thiru Kural, insists that it is deeply dishonorable to resort to begging for such a purpose.\n\nThe verse suggests that self-reliance and dignity are of utmost importance. It underscores that one must strive to meet their needs, or the needs of those they care for, through their own efforts. Begging, in any form, is presented as a severe blow to one's self-esteem and pride.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse also highlights the importance of self-sufficiency and the value of hard work. It encourages an attitude of perseverance and independent effort, rather than reliance on the charity of others. It is a call to maintain one's dignity and self-respect, even in situations of extreme need or hardship. \n\nTherefore, this kural serves as a timeless reminder of the importance of personal integrity, self-reliance, and the avoidance of unnecessary dependency on others..The kural verse:இரப்பன் இரப்பாரை எல்லாம் இரப்பின்கரப்பார் இரவன்மின் என்று. ,translates to :If beg they must I beg beggers Not to beg from shrinking misers,and it's explantion is :Kural 1067 emphasizes the importance of generously giving and discourages begging from those who are reluctant to give. The verse advises those in need to refrain from asking help from those who give unwillingly or begrudgingly. \n\nIn the context of the Thiru Kural, generosity and willingness to help others is a highly esteemed virtue. Therefore, the verse encourages those in need to seek aid from individuals who give freely, with a sense of compassion and generosity. It discourages begging from those who are reluctant to part with their resources, as it is seen as compromising one's dignity and self-respect.\n\nIn a broader sense, this kural teaches us about the value of integrity and self-esteem. It indicates that it's more honorable to endure hardship than to receive help from someone who gives out of obligation rather than kindness. It encourages us to maintain our self-respect, even in the face of adversity.\n\nThe verse also underscores the importance of the quality of a giver. True generosity is not just about giving, but also about the spirit in which the gift is given. The best kind of assistance comes from those who give willingly and generously, without any expectation of return or reluctance. \n\nSo, this kural is a call for those in need to seek help only from genuine benefactors and for those with resources to give willingly and generously..The kural verse:இரவென்னும் ஏமாப்பில் தோணி கரவென்னும்பார்தாக்கப் பக்கு விடும். ,translates to :The hapless bark of beggary splits On the rock of refusing hits,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse 1068 is about the perils of keeping up appearances or pretending to be something we are not, particularly in the context of wealth and poverty. The verse uses vivid and evocative imagery to make its point.\n\nThe verse likens begging to an unstable raft, which is dangerous and unreliable. When this 'raft' of begging, which is a false front of prosperity, encounters the rock of refusal or denial, it shatters. Here, the 'rock of refusal' refers to the moment when a person is unable to maintain the illusion of wealth and must admit to their poverty.\n\nThiruvalluvar suggests that a life of pretense, in this case pretending to be wealthy when one is not, is like navigating treacherous waters on an unsound raft. When reality strikes, the illusion cannot hold, just as a weak raft cannot withstand the impact of a rock.\n\nIn essence, the verse advises honesty and authenticity, particularly with regard to one's financial status. It warns of the dangers of living beyond one's means and the inevitable revelation of truth. It is a call to live within one's means, to be honest with oneself and others, and to avoid the perils of pretense..The kural verse:இரவுள்ள உள்ளம் உருகும் கரவுள்ளஉள்ளதூஉம் இன்றிக் கெடும். ,translates to :The heart at thought of beggars melts; It dies at repulsing insults,and it's explantion is :The verse 1069 of Thiru Kural speaks about the psychological impacts of begging and refusal to give. It portrays the emotional turmoil that occurs when one thinks about the pitiful state of those who are forced to beg and the heart-wrenching sorrow when they are denied help.\n\nHere, Valluvar uses the imagery of the heart melting and breaking to express the deep emotional pain. When one ponders on the situation of people who are reduced to begging, their heart metaphorically melts out of empathy and compassion. This indicates that the thought of someone being so destitute that they must beg is a deeply saddening and distressing thought.\n\nOn the other hand, when one thinks about those who refuse to help the needy despite having the means to do so, their heart metaphorically breaks or shatters. This suggests the deep disappointment and despair felt towards those who lack compassion and generosity, to the extent that it could emotionally devastate the thinker.\n\nIn essence, this verse is a profound reminder of the importance of empathy and generosity. It emphasizes the emotional toll that both poverty and lack of compassion can have on a person, urging us to be more understanding and giving towards those in need..The kural verse:கரப்பவர்க்கு யாங்கொளிக்கும் கொல்லோ இரப்பவர்சொல்லாடப் போஒம் உயிர். ,translates to :The word \\\"No\\\" kills the begger's life Where can the niggard's life be safe?,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural emphasizes the moral and ethical obligation one has towards the less fortunate. It underscores the importance of generosity and the serious consequences of denying aid to those in need.\n\nThe verse says that when a person who has the means to help refuses to do so, it is akin to taking away the life of the beggar. This metaphorical 'killing' of the beggar is because the refusal deprives him of his means to survive. The latter part of the verse then poses a rhetorical question: \"Where then would the latter's (the refuser's) life hide itself?\" This implies that the act of refusal would also have dire consequences for the refuser himself. \n\nThe underlying message is that when one has the means to help but chooses not to, it not only harms the person in need but also the person refusing. It could mean a spiritual or moral death for the refuser as they have failed in their duty of compassion and generosity. This verse subtly highlights the principle of karma - the belief that our actions, whether good or bad, will eventually return to us in some form. \n\nIn the cultural context, Thiruvalluvar, the author of Thirukkural, places high value on generosity and sees it as a fundamental duty of a virtuous person. This verse is a reminder of our shared humanity and our responsibility towards each other, particularly towards those less fortunate. \n\nIn summary, the verse is a stern warning against selfishness and a strong reminder of the importance of generosity and compassion..The kural verse:மக்களே போல்வர் கயவர் அவரன்னஒப்பாரி யாங்கண்ட தில். ,translates to :The mean seem men only in form We have never seen such a sham,and it's explantion is :Kural 1071 delves into the nature of human beings, particularly focusing on the duality of their character. While the verse acknowledges that individuals can harbor negative traits or 'base' characteristics, it also highlights the remarkable capacity of humans to present themselves well, often appearing as virtuous or 'good' individuals to the world.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that this duality of character - the ability to harbor negative traits but present oneself positively - is unique to human beings. We do not observe such complex behavior among other species. Animals, for example, often act on instinct and do not possess the capacity to consciously mask their true nature or intentions, unlike humans.\n\nThe Kural thus underscores the complexity of human nature, and provides a subtle commentary on the deceptive appearances that individuals can put up, masking their true character. It is a call for introspection, urging us to look beyond mere appearances and strive for true virtue. \n\nIn essence, the verse is a commentary on the complexities of human nature, urging us to be aware of the potential for deceit in appearances and to strive for genuine goodness..The kural verse:நன்றறி வாரிற் கயவர் திருவுடையர்நெஞ்சத்து அவலம் இலர். ,translates to :The base seem richer than the good For no care enters their heart or head,and it's explantion is :Kural 1072 explores the notion of contentment and peace of mind over material wealth or knowledge. It suggests that those who are ignorant (referred to as 'low' or 'kayavar' in the verse) may enjoy more happiness than those who are knowledgeable about what is good or right. \n\nThis is because the knowledgeable individuals are often troubled with the anxiety of discerning and choosing what is morally right and good, leading to a constant state of worry and tension. On the other hand, those who are ignorant of these moral distinctions do not carry this burden of decision-making and thus, are free from such anxieties. They take life as it comes and live in the moment, which might make them seem more content and happy.\n\nThis verse is not promoting ignorance, but rather it is highlighting the importance of peace of mind and contentment. It nudges us to question the value of knowledge if it only leads to worry and anxiety, suggesting that serenity of mind is a treasure that even the wealthiest or most knowledgeable might lack. \n\nHowever, it is also important to remember that this verse should not be misinterpreted as an endorsement of ignorance over knowledge. Thiruvalluvar, the author of Thirukkural, consistently promotes learning and knowledge throughout the text. Instead, this verse can be seen as an encouragement to seek wisdom and understanding that leads to inner peace, rather than knowledge that fuels anxiety and unrest..The kural verse:தேவர் அனையர் கயவர் அவருந்தாம்மேவன செய்தொழுக லான். ,translates to :The base are like gods; for they too As prompted by their desire do,and it's explantion is :Kural 1073 is an interesting verse from Thirukural that draws a comparison between the divine entities, the Gods, and the base or immoral individuals. This may initially seem like a paradox, but the verse aims to illustrate the similarity in their autonomy.\n\nThe verse says, \"The base resemble the Gods; for the base act as they like.\" This highlights the fact that both Gods and the base individuals possess the freedom to act as they please, unhindered by societal norms or rules. \n\nGods are autonomous beings who operate beyond human understanding and expectations. They are not bound by the social, ethical, or moral norms that humans are, and thus, they have the freedom to act as they desire.\n\nSimilarly, the base individuals, often considered immoral or unethical, also act according to their own will, disregarding societal norms, rules, and ethics. Their actions are driven by their desires, much like the Gods, and they do not feel the need to conform to societal expectations or norms.\n\nHowever, the comparison ends here. While Gods are revered and worshipped for their divine nature and supreme power, the base individuals are often condemned for their disregard of societal norms and unethical behavior. This verse serves as a subtle critique of those who act solely based on their desires without considering the consequences of their actions on society or others.\n\nIn essence, Kural 1073 reflects on the concept of autonomy, drawing a parallel between the divine and the base, while also underlining the importance of ethical conduct, societal norms, and responsible freedom..The kural verse:அகப்பட்டி ஆவாரைக் காணின் அவரின்மிகப்பட்டுச் செம்மாக்கும் கீழ். ,translates to :When the base meets a rake so vile Him he will exceed, exult and smile,and it's explantion is :Kural 1074 speaks about the nature of individuals who lack virtue or nobility. In this verse, Valluvar describes how such individuals gain a sense of superiority and pride when they encounter others who act worse than they do. \n\nThe verse metaphorically suggests that a 'base' or lowly person feels elevated when they see those who are even more fallen in their actions than themselves. It highlights a form of self-deception where individuals use the greater faults of others to justify their own shortcomings and feel superior. \n\nThis Kural calls out this flawed perspective and encourages self-improvement rather than comparing oneself to those who are worse off. It underlines the importance of individual growth, rectitude, and the cultivation of virtue for its own sake, rather than as a tool for relative comparison. \n\nIn essence, Valluvar's verse is a timeless reminder that one's worth is not determined by being better than the worst, but by striving to be the best version of oneself..The kural verse:அச்சமே கீழ்களது ஆசாரம் எச்சம்அவாவுண்டேல் உண்டாம் சிறிது. ,translates to :Fear forms the conduct of the low Craving avails a bit below,and it's explantion is :Kural 1075 explores the behavior of individuals who are considered as 'mean' or lower in moral standards. The verse asserts that the primary driving force behind their seemingly ethical behavior is fear, primarily fear of punishment or retribution. They adhere to moral standards and behave appropriately out of fear of the consequences of their actions, not necessarily because they genuinely believe in the righteousness of these ethics.\n\nHowever, the verse also suggests that if fear is absent, then the hope of personal gain or benefit can also inspire a certain level of decency in their behavior. In other words, their motivation to act ethically is not rooted in an inherent understanding of morality, but rather in their self-interest. If they believe that behaving in a certain way could bring them advantages, they will adopt that behavior to an extent.\n\nThis verse is a stark commentary on the influence of external motivators like fear and greed on human behavior, particularly among those who do not have an inherent inclination towards ethical conduct. It emphasizes the need for moral integrity to come from within, rather than being prompted by external factors..The kural verse:அறைபறை அன்னர் கயவர்தாம் கேட்டமறைபிறர்க்கு உய்த்துரைக்க லான். ,translates to :The base are like the beaten drum Since other's secrets they proclaim,and it's explantion is :In Kural 1076, Valluvar compares people who indiscriminately share confidential information to a drum that is beaten. The metaphor of the drum is significant. A drum makes a loud noise when struck, and the sound it produces cannot be controlled or contained – it is heard by everyone within hearing range. Similarly, people who do not value confidentiality and discretion are like a drum – they spread information widely without thought of the consequences.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of trust and discretion. Trust is a fundamental aspect of all human relationships and when someone shares a secret, it is with the expectation that the information will remain confidential. When this trust is breached, it can lead to conflict, misunderstanding, and loss of reputation. \n\nTherefore, the kural warns against such indiscreet behavior, advising one to uphold the confidence placed in them by others. It also subtly advises us to be cautious when sharing our secrets and to entrust them only to those who have proven themselves to be discreet and trustworthy..The kural verse:ஈர்ங்கை விதிரார் கயவர் கொடிறுடைக்கும்கூன்கையர் அல்லா தவர்க்கு. ,translates to :The base their damp hand will not shake But for fists clenched their jaws to break,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 1077, is a commentary on the stinginess of miserly individuals, referred to as \"the mean\" or \"kayavar\" in Tamil. It vividly illustrates the lengths to which such individuals will go to avoid sharing their wealth or possessions, even with the needy.\n\nThe verse metaphorically describes how \"the mean\" would not even shake off the leftover food sticking to their hands after a meal to anyone but those who could harm them physically, suggesting that they only give under duress or coercion. The image of clenched fists breaking jaws is a metaphor for force or intimidation.\n\nIn essence, this verse criticizes the miserly for their extreme selfishness and lack of compassion. It underscores the moral value of generosity and the importance of sharing one's resources with others, especially those in need. It also highlights the social consequences of stinginess, suggesting that such individuals are likely to be met with hostility and aggression. \n\nTherefore, the verse serves as a moral lesson, encouraging the readers to practice generosity and kindness, and to avoid the detrimental behavior of stinginess..The kural verse:சொல்லப் பயன்படுவர் சான்றோர் கரும்புபோல்கொல்லப் பயன்படும் கீழ். ,translates to :The good by soft words profits yield The cane-like base when crushed and killed,and it's explantion is :Thiru Kural 1078 examines the contrast in giving between noble and mean spirited individuals. The verse metaphorically compares the act of giving to the process of extracting juice from a sugarcane.\n\nThe first line states that the virtuous or noble-minded people give readily as soon as they are informed of a need. These individuals do not wait to be coerced or convinced, but rather act immediately upon learning of someone's hardship. Their generosity is spontaneous, and they give with a sense of empathy and compassion.\n\nThe second line contrasts this with the behaviour of those who are mean-spirited or stingy. These individuals are likened to the sugarcane, which only yields its sweetness when it is crushed or tortured. Similarly, these individuals only give when they are put under extreme pressure or when they have no other choice. Their act of giving is not based on empathy or compassion but is rather a reaction to external pressure.\n\nThis verse underlines the value of spontaneous and compassionate giving, while criticising the reluctance and lack of empathy shown by the stingy. It encourages us to be more like the noble, ready to help as soon as we come to know of someone's need..The kural verse:உடுப்பதூஉம் உண்பதூஉம் காணின் பிறர்மேல்வடுக்காண வற்றாகும் கீழ். ,translates to :Faults in others the mean will guess On seeing how they eat and dress,and it's explantion is :Kural 1079 is a commentary on the pettiness and spitefulness of those who harbor jealousy and resentment. The verse suggests that a base person, or one who is morally inferior, will find a way to criticize or accuse others out of envy when he sees them enjoying good food or clothing. This envy is born out of a sense of inferiority and discontent with one's own situation.\n\nThe verse underscores the negative characteristics of such individuals who, instead of appreciating or celebrating the prosperity of others, find fault and breed negativity. This kind of behavior is seen as a sign of a low character or moral standing.\n\nIn essence, the verse reminds us of the importance of goodwill and positive thinking. It warns against the corrosive effect of jealousy and resentment, which not only harms the person who is the subject of such negativity but also diminishes the person who harbors these negative feelings..The kural verse:எற்றிற் குரியர் கயவரொன்று உற்றக்கால்விற்றற்கு உரியர் விரைந்து. ,translates to :The base hasten to sell themselves From doom to flit and nothing else,and it's explantion is :Kural 1080 deals with the character of those who are base in nature, often referred to as \"kayavar\" in Thirukural. These are individuals who are willing to compromise their principles and dignity in times of adversity.\n\nThe verse says \"The base will hasten to sell themselves as soon as a calamity has befallen them. For what else are they fitted?\" This means that in times of crisis, these individuals quickly resort to selling their honor and self-respect as a means of escape. This is because they lack the moral fiber to withstand difficulties and prefer to seek an easy way out, even if it means degrading themselves. \n\nThe rhetorical question at the end, \"For what else are they fitted?\" is a commentary on their lack of virtues and strength of character. It points out the inherent flaw in their nature, which is their readiness to give up their values when confronted with challenges.\n\nIn essence, this verse is a critique of those who easily compromise their honor and integrity in the face of adversity, and it encourages the reader to cultivate resilience and moral strength to withstand any calamity..The kural verse:அணங்குகொல் ஆய்மயில் கொல்லோ கனங்குழைமாதர்கொல் மாலும் என் நெஞ்சு. ,translates to :Is it an angel? A fair peacock Or jewelled belle? To my mind a shock!,and it's explantion is :This verse beautifully captures the bewitching allure of a woman who dazzles the observer to such an extent that he is left bewildered about her identity. The poet is so taken aback by her charm and elegance that he begins to question if she is a heavenly nymph, a graceful peahen, or a human woman adorned with jewels. \n\nThe celestial nymph is known for their divine beauty in the traditional Indian mythologies. The peahen is an epitome of grace and charm in the animal kingdom. The observer finds an enchanting blend of both these qualities in the woman, along with the allure of precious jewels that accentuate her human charm.\n\nThe verse speaks volumes about the captivating beauty of women, which can leave one transfixed and perplexed. It also highlights the power of beauty to bewilder the mind and stimulate imagination. This verse essentially celebrates feminine beauty and the spellbinding effect it can have on an observer, leading to a state of delightful confusion and wonder..The kural verse:நோக்கினாள் நோக்கெதிர் நோக்குதல் தாக்கணங்குதானைக்கொண் டன்ன துடைத்து. ,translates to :The counter glances of this belle Are armied dart of the Love-Angel,and it's explantion is :Kural 1082 is a vivid observation of the power of attraction and the impact it can have on an individual. The poet compares a woman's gaze to a celestial maiden leading an army, highlighting the irresistible and overwhelming force of her beauty. The woman's reciprocation of the poet's gaze is seen as a powerful act, one that he perceives as a challenge or a battle.\n\nIn the cultural context, celestial maidens are often depicted as extraordinarily beautiful figures in Indian mythology. By comparing the woman's gaze to a celestial maiden with an army, the poet is emphasizing the formidable nature of her beauty, suggesting that it is capable of captivating and overpowering him, just like an army would in a battle.\n\nThe moral interpretation is that physical beauty can have a strong influence on individuals, to the point that it can feel like a battle or a challenge to resist. However, it is important to remember that true beauty lies within and to not get swayed solely by physical appearances. The Kural serves as a reminder of the powerful draw of external beauty and the need for inner strength to not get overwhelmed by it..The kural verse:பண்டறியேன் கூற்றென் பதனை இனியறிந்தேன்பெண்டகையால் பேரமர்க் கட்டு. ,translates to :Not known before -I spy Demise In woman's guise with battling eyes,and it's explantion is :Kural 1083 reflects on the captivating power of feminine charm, especially the allure of a woman's eyes, which the poet metaphorically equates to Yama, the Hindu deity of death. \n\nIn this verse, Valluvar states that he was unaware of the concept of Yama until he experienced the irresistible allure of a woman's eyes. He describes the eyes as engaging in a significant battle, wielding the strength of feminine qualities. This implies the immense power of feminine allure to stir deep emotions, captivate attention, and potentially lead one astray, akin to Yama who is known for leading souls to their final journey after death. \n\nThe poet's comparison of a woman's eyes to Yama may also suggest the idea of \"falling\" for someone, where one becomes metaphorically \"lost\" or \"dead\" to their usual self, consumed by their attraction. \n\nThis verse underscores the theme of love's overpowering nature and the captivating charm of femininity. It is a poetic reminder of the need for self-restraint and wisdom in the face of such overwhelming allure..The kural verse:கண்டார் உயிருண்ணும் தோற்றத்தால் பெண்டகைப்பேதைக்கு அமர்த்தன கண். ,translates to :This artless dame has darting eyes That drink the life of men who gaze,and it's explantion is :Kural 1084 is a nuanced reflection on the captivating power of a woman's eyes and their contrast with her inherent simplicity. \n\nIn this verse, Valluvar uses a metaphor to describe the eyes of a woman as potentially 'killing' those who behold them. This does not refer to a literal death but portrays the mesmerizing and enthralling influence a woman's eyes can have on someone who gazes into them, so much so that they may lose themselves or feel 'slain' by their allure.\n\nHowever, what Valluvar finds intriguing and paradoxical is the contrast between this captivating power and the woman's 'feminine simplicity'. This term refers to the inherent innocence, modesty, and humility that are traditionally associated with womanhood. The poet observes a contradiction between these two aspects - the almost fatal attraction of the woman's eyes and her innate simplicity - as if they were in a state of 'hostilities' with each other.\n\nThus, the Kural poses a rhetorical question - why such a contradiction exists. It implicitly highlights the complex nature of femininity, which can simultaneously embody captivating allure and sublime simplicity. This verse, therefore, invites contemplation on the profound layers of femininity and the delicate balance between charm and modesty..The kural verse:கூற்றமோ கண்ணோ பிணையோ மடவரல்நோக்கமிம் மூன்றும் உடைத்து. ,translates to :Is it death, eye or doe? All three In winsome woman's look I see,and it's explantion is :Kural 1085 delves into the allure, charm, and mystique of a woman's gaze. The poet poses a question, asking if the look of a young maiden equates to the powerful God of Death (Yama), a captivating pair of eyes, or an enchanting hind.\n\nEach of these three elements carries a distinct significance. Firstly, Yama, the God of Death in Hindu mythology, is renowned for his irresistible power and inevitability, suggesting that the maiden's gaze has an unavoidable pull. Secondly, a pair of eyes is traditionally considered the window to the soul, indicating the depth and complexity within the maiden's gaze. Lastly, a hind (female deer) is famed for its grace and beauty, hinting at the allure of the gaze.\n\nThis verse thus communicates that the young woman's gaze holds the power to captivate, to reveal depth, and to enchant with its beauty, much like Yama, a pair of eyes, and a hind, respectively. It is a poetic tribute to the bewitching charm of a woman's gaze, intricately drawing parallels with powerful and beautiful elements of life and nature..The kural verse:கொடும்புருவம் கோடா மறைப்பின் நடுங்கஞர்செய்யல மன்இவள் கண். ,translates to :If cruel brows unbent, would screen Her eyes won't cause me trembling pain,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse talks about the bewitching power of a woman's eyes and the emotional impact they can have on the observer. The poet says that the woman's eyes would not cause him any poignant or trembling sorrow, if they were properly concealed by her cruel arched eyebrows.\n\nThe word 'cruel' here doesn't refer to the actual character of the woman, rather it indicates the intense effect her beauty has on the beholder. The 'trembling sorrow' represents the overwhelming emotions that are stirred in the poet when he gazes into her eyes.\n\nThe eyebrows are described as 'cruel' and 'arched'. The arch of the eyebrows could be seen as a barrier or a shield, hiding the true power of the eyes. If these eyebrows were to straighten and no longer hide the eyes, the poet suggests that he would be spared from the intense emotional turmoil invoked by her gaze.\n\nThis verse is a metaphorical representation of the profound impact of beauty and the emotions it can stir in individuals. It highlights the significance of restraint and modesty, suggesting that hiding or toning down one's beauty can spare others from emotional anguish. The verse also subtly hints at the power and influence women can wield through their beauty..The kural verse:கடாஅக் களிற்றின்மேற் கட்படாம் மாதர்படாஅ முலைமேல் துகில். ,translates to :Vest on the buxom breast of her Looks like rutting tusker's eye-cover,and it's explantion is :This verse is a beautiful metaphorical comparison made by the poet. In this verse, the maiden's clothing, which covers her firm bosom, is likened to the cloth that covers the eyes of a rutting elephant. \n\nThe rutting elephant here symbolizes a creature that is filled with intense, uncontrolled passion. The cloth placed over its eyes is meant to keep it calm by blocking out visual distractions. All it can do is sense the cloth and nothing beyond it, much like how the maiden's clothing shields her modesty from the gaze of others. \n\nThe comparison here is used to emphasize the power of modesty and the importance of clothing in preserving the dignity and respect of a woman. Just as the cloth over the eyes of the elephant controls its wild passion, the clothing of the maiden keeps unwanted attention and desires at bay. It serves as a barrier, protecting her from inappropriate gazes, much like the cloth shields the elephant from distractions that might incite its passion further.\n\nThis verse is a testament to the societal norms and values of the time, where modesty was highly regarded. It also subtly highlights a woman's autonomy over her body, her choice of clothing serving as her shield..The kural verse:ஒண்ணுதற் கோஒ உடைந்ததே ஞாட்பினுள்நண்ணாரும் உட்குமென் பீடு. ,translates to :Ah these fair brows shatter my might Feared by foemen yet to meet,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse appreciates the captivating beauty of the beloved and how it can overpower even the most fearless and powerful. The poet says that the radiant forehead of his lover has the power to dissolve his strength, which was once formidable enough to terrify even the bravest of individuals. \n\nThis metaphorical description implies the deep affection and attraction the poet feels for his beloved. The 'power' he refers to could be physical strength, intellectual prowess, or social influence, but in the presence of his beloved, all these seem to lose their significance. \n\nThe verse vividly portrays the idea of love being so potent that it can make the strongest person feel weak. It suggests that love has the power to humble, to soften, and to make the most formidable surrender. This is a common theme in many cultures and literatures around the world, where love is depicted as a force that transcends all other abilities and strengths. \n\nIn the broader moral context, this verse also highlights the theme of humility and the understanding that there are forces in life, such as love, that are beyond our control and can make us feel vulnerable, irrespective of our power and status. The verse encourages us to acknowledge and respect these forces, instead of being arrogant about our strength and accomplishments..The kural verse:பிணையேர் மடநோக்கும் நாணும் உடையாட்குஅணியெவனோ ஏதில தந்து. ,translates to :Which jewel can add to her beauty With fawn-like looks and modesty?,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1089 emphasizes the value of modesty and natural beauty over artificial adornments. The verse metaphorically refers to a woman's modesty as her most precious jewel, superior to any material decoration. It further highlights the charm of a woman's innocent, deer-like gaze, which, like her modesty, is an innate attribute that outshines any external embellishment.\n\nThe verse essentially suggests that natural virtues such as modesty and innocence are the true adornments of a woman, making any artificial jewel seem redundant. These virtues not only enhance her beauty but also reflect her character and inner strength. \n\nThis verse is a part of Thiruvalluvar's broader discourse on the moral and ethical aspects of life, where he consistently prioritizes internal virtues over external appearances. It is an enduring reminder that true beauty resides within, and no amount of material adornment can substitute for it..The kural verse:உண்டார்கண் அல்லது அடுநறாக் காமம்போல்கண்டார் மகிழ்செய்தல் இன்று. ,translates to :To the drunk alone is wine delight Nothing delights like love at sight,and it's explantion is :The 1090th Kural primarily discusses the profoundness and enchanting power of love. It draws a comparison between the experience of consuming honey and the experience of love. \n\nHoney, when consumed, provides sweetness and pleasure to the person drinking it. However, the delight it offers is limited to the act of consumption itself. A mere sight of honey does not bring the same level of joy as consuming it does. This is because the charm of honey lies in its taste, which can only be experienced when it is consumed.\n\nOn the other hand, love is depicted as a more powerful and profound emotion. The joy it imparts is not confined to direct engagement or physical interaction alone. Even the mere sight or thought of the beloved can bring immense happiness and a sense of euphoria. Love, unlike honey, does not require consumption for one to experience its sweetness. The mere presence or thought of the beloved is enough to induce feelings of joy and contentment.\n\nThis Kural, therefore, emphasizes the transcendent and captivating nature of love that goes beyond physical gratification, suggesting its ability to provide pleasure merely through sight or thought. Hence, the Kural implies that the experience of love is more profound and delightful than the act of consuming honey..The kural verse:இருநோக்கு இவளுண்கண் உள்ளது ஒருநோக்குநோய்நோக்கொன் றந்நோய் மருந்து. ,translates to :Her painted eyes, two glances dart One hurts; the other heals my heart,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 1091, from Thirukkural, explores the intriguing facet of romantic love, symbolizing the paradoxical power of the beloved's gaze. \n\nThe verse suggests that the eyes of the beloved, described as \"dyed\", possibly referring to the cultural practice of enhancing the beauty of the eyes with kohl or other cosmetics, have a dual effect. One look from the beloved can cause a kind of emotional pain or discomfort, presumably the longing and yearning associated with profound romantic affection. This may also symbolize the uncertainty and vulnerability that often accompanies love. \n\nHowever, the verse also asserts that the beloved's gaze has a remedial effect. The same eyes that inflict the 'pain' of love also deliver the 'cure'. This could mean that the reassurance, acceptance, or reciprocation of love seen in the beloved's eyes can alleviate the earlier discomfort caused by love. It is a beautiful depiction of the dichotomy of love, its capacity to both wound and heal. \n\nFurthermore, the verse may imply how deeply the speaker's emotions are tied to the beloved, to the extent that their mere look can stir such powerful emotions. It captures the essence of romantic love and its complexities in a simple yet profound way..The kural verse:கண்களவு கொள்ளும் சிறுநோக்கம் காமத்தில்செம்பாகம் அன்று பெரிது. ,translates to :Her furtive lightning glance is more Than enjoyment of sexual lore,and it's explantion is :Kural 1092 delves into the realm of romantic love and the intense pleasure derived from the subtle nuances of a beloved's actions. It basically states that a fleeting, stolen glance from the beloved's eyes can provide more joy than even the physical act of love itself. \n\nThe beauty of this verse lies in its emphasis on the emotional and psychological aspects of love, rather than the physical. The 'stolen glance' symbolizes the unspoken, hidden feelings that lovers share, often more powerful and meaningful than expressed affections. The 'eye' is often considered a window to the soul, and a glance, especially a stolen one, can reveal a multitude of emotions such as love, longing, desire, or coyness.\n\nFurthermore, the verse also reflects the cultural context of ancient Tamil society where love was often expressed subtly due to societal norms and constraints. Here, the stolen glance becomes an act of rebellion, an assertion of love against societal expectations, making it even more pleasurable and significant.\n\nIn essence, this Kural emphasizes the depth and complexity of love and passion, stating that they are not just physical but deeply emotional and psychological, often found in the simplest and subtlest of gestures..The kural verse:நோக்கினாள் நோக்கி இறைஞ்சினாள் அஃதவள்யாப்பினுள் அட்டிய நீர். ,translates to :She looked; looking bowed her head And love-plant was with water fed,and it's explantion is :This Kural (1093) speaks of the subtle cues of love and affection in the early stages of a romantic relationship. The poet uses a beautiful metaphor to describe the nuanced communication between two individuals who share a mutual affection.\n\nWhen the woman looks at the man and then shyly lowers her gaze, it is a subtle sign of her interest and affection. This act of looking and then modestly stooping her head is compared to the watering of a crop. Just like water nourishes the crop and helps it grow, her subtle signs of affection nourish the love that is budding between them. It provides the reassurance and encouragement for their love to flourish.\n\nThe poet beautifully captures the unspoken language of love. The verse appreciates the modesty and shyness, which are considered virtuous characteristics in the Tamil culture and are often seen as an expression of genuine love and affection. It also highlights the importance of mutual affection and understanding in nourishing a relationship.\n\nIn essence, the verse emphasizes the beauty of the beginning of love, with its subtle signs and signals, and how these small gestures can become the nourishment for a blooming relationship..The kural verse:யான்நோக்கும் காலை நிலன்நோக்கும் நோக்காக்கால்தான்நோக்கி மெல்ல நகும். ,translates to :I look; she droops to earth awhile I turn; she looks with gentle smile,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural captures the subtle nuances of love and courtship. It beautifully articulates the behavior of a woman expressing her affection discreetly and modestly. \n\nThe first line, \"When I look, she looks down,\" portrays the woman's shy demeanor when she is being observed by the one she loves. This behavior is often seen as a form of modesty, a way to maintain a sense of decorum and respect, which was highly valued in the traditional Tamil culture.\n\nThe second line, \"when I do not, she looks and smiles gently,\" reveals the woman's hidden affection. When she is unobserved, she takes the opportunity to steal a glance at her beloved and allows herself a soft, private smile. This secretive smile is her way of expressing her joy and love.\n\nThe verse beautifully encapsulates the delicate dance of love and attraction. It's a dance where feelings are expressed subtly, through glances and smiles, rather than words. It emphasizes the cultural norms of the time, where modesty and discretion were highly valued, particularly in the expression of romantic feelings..The kural verse:குறிக்கொண்டு நோக்காமை அல்லால் ஒருகண்சிறக்கணித்தாள் போல நகும் ,translates to :No direct gaze; a side-long glance She darts at me and smiles askance,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse 1095 is a delicate portrayal of a lover's observation about his beloved's subtle expressions. The verse beautifully captures the nuanced dynamics of romantic attraction and courtship.\n\nThe verse says, \"She not only avoids a direct look at me, but looks as it were with a half-closed eye and smiles.\" This can be perceived as a description of a coy and playful exchange between the lovers. The woman, out of modesty or playful coquetry, avoids making direct eye contact with the man. Instead, she glances at him with a half-closed eye, an action that is often associated with bashfulness, intrigue or subtle seduction in many cultures.\n\nThe smile that accompanies her gaze suggests a shared understanding or a secret amusement, possibly acknowledging the mutual attraction they share. The man interprets this as her inner joy in their connection, even though she may not openly express it. \n\nThis verse highlights the unspoken language of love, where emotions are conveyed through glances and smiles rather than words. It also underscores a common theme in classical romantic literature where love is often expressed subtly, with an emphasis on modesty and decorum..The kural verse:உறாஅ தவர்போல் சொலினும் செறாஅர்சொல்ஒல்லை உணரப் படும். ,translates to :Their words at first seem an offence But quick we feel them friendly ones,and it's explantion is :Kural 1096 is a profound verse that delves into the complexities of human interaction, particularly in the context of close relationships. It emphasizes that the true intentions of a person, even when camouflaged by harsh words, are often discernible to those who understand them well.\n\nThe verse suggests that even when a person who cares for you speaks in a way that seems harsh or unfriendly, akin to a stranger, their underlying positive intentions or affection will soon become apparent. This is because the words of the friendly, despite their external harshness, carry an inherent warmth and concern that cannot be hidden for long.\n\nThe cultural context here is the importance given to understanding the true intentions behind words in Tamil society. It tells us that the essence of communication lies not just in the words spoken, but also in understanding the speaker's emotions and intentions.\n\nThe moral interpretation of this Kural is that we should look beyond the surface level of communication, especially when dealing with loved ones or close friends. Their seemingly harsh words may be driven by concern, love, or a desire for our betterment. Therefore, it is essential to discern the true intent behind the words instead of reacting immediately to their superficial harshness..The kural verse:செறாஅச் சிறுசொல்லும் செற்றார்போல் நோக்கும்உறாஅர்போன்று உற்றார் குறிப்பு. ,translates to :Harsh little words; offended looks, Are feigned consenting love-lorn tricks,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural talks about the complex dynamics in love relationships. The verse states that harsh words that are not driven by hatred and glances that seem hostile are the signs of lovers who are pretending to act like strangers.\n\nThe verse explores the depth of love where the external behavior may not always reflect the true feelings. In certain situations, lovers may express their affection in a distorted manner, using harsh words or giving hostile looks, not out of enmity, but as a means of masking their deep affection. This behavior is compared to their attempt to act like strangers, concealing their love beneath an exterior of indifference or hostility.\n\nThe verse provides a profound insight into the complexities of human emotions, especially in the context of romantic relationships. It reminds us that appearances can often be deceptive, and what may seem like hostility or indifference may in fact be a cover for deep-seated love and affection. This understanding can help us navigate our relationships with a deeper sense of empathy and emotional intelligence..The kural verse:அசையியற்கு உண்டாண்டோர் ஏஎர்யான் நோக்கப்பசையினள் பைய நகும். ,translates to :What a grace the slim maid has! As I look she slightly smiles,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural is a beautiful expression of the nuances of romantic affection and shared understanding. It delves into the subtleties of non-verbal communication between two people who share a deep emotional bond.\n\nThe Kural says, \"When I gaze at her, she returns my look with a gentle, compassionate smile, which brings a sense of comfort and reassurance to me.\" The poet talks about the mutual understanding and unspoken affection between him and his beloved. The mere act of exchanging glances and the gentle smile that she gives in return is a comforting sign for him. It assures him of her affection and understanding, providing a sense of solace and warmth.\n\nThis verse also highlights how small gestures in a relationship can carry deep meanings. The woman's gentle smile, in response to the poet's gaze, is not merely a smile but a communication of her feelings towards him. It's a subtle expression of her affection, her understanding, and her companionship, which the poet interprets as a comforting sign.\n\nMoreover, it subtly brings to the forefront the power of non-verbal communication in expressing emotions. In this case, a simple act of smiling becomes a powerful tool of communication between the two lovers, conveying feelings that words might not adequately express.\n\nIn essence, this verse from Thirukkural speaks about the profound connection between two people in love, where even a simple act of exchanging glances or a gentle smile can convey deep feelings and bring comfort. It underscores the depth of their relationship and the power of non-verbal cues in expressing affection..The kural verse:ஏதிலார் போலப் பொதுநோக்கு நோக்குதல்காதலார் கண்ணே உள. ,translates to :Between lovers we do discern A stranger's look of unconcern,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukural talks about an intriguing behaviour observed among lovers. It suggests that when lovers meet in public, they often pretend to be mere acquaintances or strangers, displaying an aloofness that belies the intense affection they have for each other. \n\nThe verse implies that this is not due to any lack of love, but rather a mannerism borne out of respect for societal norms or discretion. The lovers are capable of looking at each other as if they were perfect strangers, even though their hearts may be brimming with affection and longing.\n\nIt also reflects a deeper understanding of love that goes beyond physicality or overt expressions. The lovers communicate through their eyes, which are windows to their souls. They understand each other's feelings and emotions without the need for words or actions. This verse thus brings out the subtlety and depth of love, where what is left unsaid often holds more meaning than what is expressed openly. \n\nIn a broader context, this verse teaches us about self-control, restraint, and the ability to separate personal feelings from public behaviour. It advises us to navigate our relationships with wisdom, respecting the boundaries set by society and circumstance..The kural verse:கண்ணொடு கண்இணை நோக்கொக்கின் வாய்ச்சொற்கள்என்ன பயனும் இல. ,translates to :The words of mouth are of no use When eye to eye agrees the gaze,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural highlights the profound intimacy and understanding that can occur between two individuals in love, where verbal communication becomes unnecessary. The verse suggests that in the deepest forms of connection, the eyes can convey emotions, thoughts, and sentiments more effectively than spoken words. This silent communication can be more intimate, immediate, and profound, transcending the need for verbal exchanges.\n\nThe verse metaphorically uses the eyes as a means of communication, reflecting the depth of understanding and mutual connection between two lovers. This verse captures the essence of non-verbal communication, where emotions and feelings can be expressed and understood without uttering a single word. \n\nIn a broader perspective, it can be interpreted as a call for deep empathy and understanding in relationships, suggesting that true connection goes beyond words. The ultimate form of communication, according to this verse, is not about speaking or listening, but about feeling and understanding with depth and empathy..The kural verse:கண்டுகேட்டு உண்டுயிர்த்து உற்றறியும் ஐம்புலனும்ஒண்தொடி கண்ணே உள. ,translates to :In this bangled beauty dwell The joys of sight sound touch taste smell,and it's explantion is :Kural 1101 delves into the realm of romantic love, and highlights the sensual pleasures experienced in the companionship of a beloved woman. \n\nThis Kural refers to the five sensory perceptions: sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. The poet, Thiruvalluvar, asserts that the simultaneous enjoyment of these five senses can only be truly experienced in the company of a woman who is adorned with bright bracelets. \n\nThe sight refers to the visual delight one experiences when they behold their beloved. The hearing pertains to the sweet words or melodious laughter of the loved one. Taste can refer to the shared meals or intimate moments, and smell could denote the fragrance emanating from her. Touch, the last sense, could be the physical closeness or touch of the beloved.\n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes that a woman's charm, which can be accentuated by her adornments like bright bracelets, provides an all-encompassing sensory experience that satiates all five senses of a person, making the experience of love more profound and enjoyable.\n\nThe cultural context here is the importance of adornments in ancient Tamil society, where women used to wear bright bracelets. These bracelets are not just decorative items, but symbolic of the woman's charm and attractiveness. \n\nAs a moral interpretation, the verse encourages appreciating the beauty of one's partner in a holistic manner, engaging all senses, rather than focusing on a singular aspect. It promotes a wholesome and deep-seated love that goes beyond the superficial..The kural verse:பிணிக்கு மருந்து பிறமன் அணியிழைதன்நோய்க்குத் தானே மருந்து. ,translates to :The cure for ailment is somewhere For fair maid's ill she is the cure,and it's explantion is :Kural 1102 delves into the realm of love and emotions, comparing the pangs of love to a disease. In this verse, Thiruvalluvar is essentially saying that while the cure for most ailments is something distinct from the ailment itself, the cure for the ailment of love is love itself or the beloved one.\n\nThe verse opens by noting that the remedy for a disease is usually something different. For instance, if one suffers from a fever, the cure would be medicine, which is different from the fever itself. However, the poet then moves on to the 'disease' caused by the 'jewelled maid' - a metaphor for love or the beloved woman. Here, the beloved woman is the cause of the lover's emotional distress - the 'disease' - but paradoxically, she is also the only cure for it. \n\nIn other words, the grievance or pain caused by love can only be cured by the presence, affection, or attention of the loved one. This highlights the unique nature of love, where the source of pain and the cure for it are one and the same. \n\nThe verse emphasizes the profound depth of emotional attachment in love, where the beloved person becomes the focal point of the lover's existence. It also reflects the universal human experience, where love often brings a mix of joy and pain, and the loved one is the only solace in times of emotional distress..The kural verse:தாம்வீழ்வார் மென்றோள் துயிலின் இனிதுகொல்தாமரைக் கண்ணான் உலகு. ,translates to :Is lotus-eyed lord's heaven so sweet As sleep in lover's arms so soft?,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse (Kural 1103) beautifully captures the depth of human love and affection. Here, the poet Valluvar uses a delightful comparison between the bliss of heaven and the joy experienced in the arms of a beloved.\n\nThe verse questions whether even the 'lotus-eyed' Vishnu's heaven (Vishnu being one of the principal deities in Hinduism, often associated with preservation and love) could be as sweet as being in the delicate, comforting arms of one's beloved. The 'lotus-eyed' adjective refers to the divine beauty and compassion of the deity.\n\nThe underlying theme here is the profound joy and contentment found in human love. It suggests that the ecstasy of being with one's loved one might outshine even the divine pleasures of heaven. \n\nThe verse is a testimony to the poet's understanding of human emotions and his ability to compare it with divine bliss, thereby making a profound statement about the power of love. This verse can be interpreted as a celebration of human relationships and the joy they bring, which can be perceived as a heavenly experience in itself..The kural verse:நீங்கின் தெறூஉம் குறுகுங்கால் தண்ணென்னும்தீயாண்டுப் பெற்றாள் இவள்? ,translates to :Away it burns and cools anear Wherefrom did she get this fire?,and it's explantion is :This verse is a reflection of the poet's emotional state in relation to his beloved. In this Kural, Valluvar speaks of the paradoxical nature of love, where the beloved's absence causes a burning sensation of longing and her presence cools it down, providing comfort and relief.\n\nThe poet asks, \"From where did she get this unique fire?\" Here, the fire symbolizes the passionate love and the emotional turmoil he experiences. It's a fire that burns when she is far and cools when she is near. It's a rhetorical question expressing his bewilderment at the inexplicable nature of love.\n\nThe verse highlights the intense longing and yearning one feels when separated from their beloved, and the soothing comfort that their presence brings. It underscores the emotional fluctuations in love, and the powerful impact a beloved can have on one's emotional state.\n\nThe profound mystery of love is further emphasized. Love is likened to an extraordinary fire - it possesses the unusual capability to both ignite passion when the beloved is away, and soothe when she is near. It's a vivid metaphorical representation of the dual aspects of love: the agony of separation and the ecstasy of union. The poet marvels at this unique phenomenon, wondering where his beloved obtained such a distinctive ability..The kural verse:வேட்ட பொழுதின் அவையவை போலுமேதோட்டார் கதுப்பினாள் தோள். ,translates to :The arms of my flower-tressed maid Whatever I wish that that accord,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1105 can be interpreted as a vivid depiction of the poet's admiration for his beloved's beauty. The Kural uses a metaphor, comparing the woman's arms adorned with flower garlands to the pleasure derived from achieving one's desires.\n\nThe first line, \"வேட்ட பொழுதின் அவையவை போலுமே\" (Vetta poludhin avaiyavai polume), translates to \"like the joy of achieving what one aspires for\". It implies the joy and satisfaction one experiences when they achieve their desired goals or wishes.\n\nThe second line, \"தோட்டார் கதுப்பினாள் தோள்\" (Thottar kadhuppinaal thoal), refers to the arms of the beloved adorned with flower garlands. In the cultural context, women in ancient Tamil society used to decorate their hair and arms with flower garlands as a symbol of beauty and femininity.\n\nPutting these together, the Kural essentially means that the sight of the beloved's flower-adorned arms brings as much joy and pleasure as fulfilling one's desires or wishes. It is a metaphorical expression of the intense pleasure one derives from the beauty and companionship of their beloved.\n\nTherefore, this verse is a beautiful expression of love and admiration, highlighting how the poet's beloved's beauty brings him immense joy and satisfaction, equating it to the joy of achieving one's desires..The kural verse:உறுதோறு உயிர்தளிர்ப்பத் தீண்டலால் பேதைக்குஅமிழ்தின் இயன்றன தோள். ,translates to :My simple maid has nectar arms Each embrace brings life-thrilling charms,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse, Kural 1106, is a passionate expression of the poet's profound love and adoration for his beloved. It is part of the Inbam section of the Thiru Kural, which focuses on the pleasures and aspects of love.\n\nIn this verse, the poet compares his beloved's shoulders to ambrosia - the divine nectar that bestows immortality in Hindu mythology. He elaborates that every time he embraces her, the contact with her shoulders brings him such intense joy and bliss that it feels life-giving, rejuvenating his spirit and making him feel alive. \n\nHis use of the term 'ambrosia' signifies her essentiality in his life, as ambrosia is quintessential for the gods' immortality. The verse beautifully encapsulates the idea that love and the physical closeness between two individuals can have a revitalizing and invigorating effect.\n\nIn summary, this verse exemplifies the power of love and physical intimacy in revitalizing a person, equating the experience to gaining a new lease on life..The kural verse:தம்மில் இருந்து தமதுபாத்து உண்டற்றால்அம்மா அரிவை முயக்கு. ,translates to :Ah the embrace of this fair dame Is like sharing one's food at home,and it's explantion is :Kural 1107 explores the idea of pleasure derived from two different, yet equally satisfying aspects of life - the bliss of a loving relationship and the joy of self-earned, shared prosperity.\n\nThe verse metaphorically compares the delight of a man embracing his beautiful, beloved wife, with the satisfaction of living comfortably in one's own home, nourished by one's hard-earned wealth, especially after having shared a portion of it with others. Both instances provide a deep sense of contentment and joy.\n\nThe first part of the comparison highlights the emotional intimacy and fulfilment found in a loving relationship. The beauty of the wife is symbolically represented by her gold complexion, depicting not only physical attractiveness but also the inner beauty of love and companionship. \n\nThe second part of the comparison stresses the importance of self-reliance and the joy of sharing one's wealth. Living in one's own house symbolizes independence, while earning one's livelihood signifies hard work and personal accomplishment. The act of distributing a portion of one's earnings emphasizes the virtue of generosity and the happiness derived from helping others.\n\nIn essence, this verse conveys the idea that both the pleasure derived from a loving relationship and the satisfaction of leading an independent, generous life contribute to the overall happiness of a person. It teaches us to value both our personal relationships and our social responsibilities for a fulfilled life..The kural verse:வீழும் இருவர்க்கு இனிதே வளியிடைபோழப் படாஅ முயக்கு. ,translates to :Joy is the fast embrace that doth Not admit e'en air between both,and it's explantion is :Kural 1108 is a beautiful depiction of profound love and intimacy between two lovers. The verse metaphorically speaks of an embrace so close that not even a breath of breeze can penetrate it. This signifies an unassailable bond of love that is beyond physical closeness. It is a togetherness so deep that no external force can come between it, symbolized here by the 'breath of breeze'. \n\nThe verse also emphasizes the sweetness or pleasure derived from such an intense embrace, especially for those who deeply love each other. It suggests that for the true lovers, their joy and fulfillment lie in this close companionship and mutual understanding that is impenetrable, even by the slightest wind.\n\nIn the cultural context, this Kural articulates a high degree of emotional bonding and mutual affection that is considered the essence of true love in Tamil tradition. It conveys the message that the bliss of love is not in mere physical attraction but in the closeness of hearts and minds that is metaphorically represented as a tight embrace..The kural verse:ஊடல் உணர்தல் புணர்தல் இவைகாமம்கூடியார் பெற்ற பயன். ,translates to :Sulking, feeling and clasping fast These three are sweets of lover's tryst,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 1109, talks about the aspects of romantic love and passion within the context of marriage. It says that playful quarrelling, understanding each other, and physical intimacy are the joys experienced by those who marry out of lust or passionate love. \n\nIn a deeper sense, this verse is not just about physical attraction or lust, but also about emotional connection and understanding. \"Playful quarrelling\" or \"Oodal\" in Tamil, is a form of lovers' tiff or playful banter that adds spice to a relationship and deepens the bond between the couple. It brings out the nuances of their personalities and can be a way of understanding each other better.\n\n\"Understanding each other\" or \"Unarthal\" in Tamil, highlights the importance of empathy and comprehension in a relationship. It's about understanding each other's needs, desires, fears, strengths, and weaknesses, which forms the basis of a strong bond. \n\nFinally, \"physical intimacy\" or \"Punardhal\" in Tamil, represents the physical expression of love and desire. It signifies the consummation of love in a marital relationship.\n\nIn essence, this verse says that these three aspects - playful quarrelling, mutual understanding, and physical intimacy - are the pleasures that those who marry out of passionate love enjoy..The kural verse:அறிதோறு அறியாமை கண்டற்றால் காமம்செறிதோறும் சேயிழை மாட்டு. ,translates to :As knowledge reveals past ignorance So is the belle as love gets close,and it's explantion is :Kural 1110 discusses the ever-growing nature of both knowledge and desire. \n\nThe first part of the verse compares gaining knowledge to the process of uncovering one's own ignorance. The more we learn, the more we realize how much we don't know. The exposure to new information and ideas often leads to an understanding of how vast and deep the world of knowledge truly is. \n\nThe second part of the verse analogously speaks about desire, specifically sexual desire towards a beautifully adorned woman. It suggests that the more one indulges in physical pleasure with a desirable woman, the more the desire for her grows. Just like how the pursuit of knowledge unveils the vastness of ignorance, the continuous indulgence in sexual pleasure reveals the unending depth of desire. \n\nThis verse underlines the insatiable nature of desire and knowledge. It emphasizes that both are infinite pursuits, where the more you acquire, the more you realize what remains to be acquired. It is a reminder to maintain balance and restraint in the pursuit of pleasure and knowledge..The kural verse:நன்னீரை வாழி அனிச்சமே நின்னினும்மென்னீரள் யாம்வீழ் பவள். ,translates to :Soft blessed anicha flower, hail On whom I dote is softer still,and it's explantion is :The verse 1111 from Thiru Kural is a beautiful comparison of the speaker's beloved to the delicate Anicham flower. In this verse, the poet is praising the Anicham flower for its tenderness and wishing it to flourish, yet he states that his beloved is even more delicate than this flower. \n\nThe Anicham flower, known for its softness and subtle fragrance, is a symbol of gentleness and delicacy in the Tamil culture. It is considered as one of the softest and most delicate flowers. Here, the poet is not just praising the flower, but also using it as a metaphor to express the delicate nature of his beloved. \n\nThe poet's comparison of his beloved to the Anicham flower suggests his deep affection and regard for her. It is a way of expressing that she possesses an understated elegance and gentleness that surpasses even that of the revered Anicham flower. \n\nOverall, this verse is a profound expression of love and admiration, using the symbolism of the delicate Anicham flower to convey the beloved's unique and exquisite qualities..The kural verse:மலர்காணின் மையாத்தி நெஞ்சே இவள்கண்பலர்காணும் பூவொக்கும் என்று. ,translates to :You can't liken flowers by many eyed, To her bright eyes, O mind dismayed,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural is a beautiful depiction of the lover's infatuation towards his beloved. Here, the poet addresses his own heart, which is entranced by the eyes of his beloved. He compares her eyes with flowers that are seen and admired by many. \n\nThe poet's heart, upon seeing these flowers, is reminded of his beloved's eyes and becomes confused or lost in the memory of her gaze. The comparison of her eyes to flowers that are admired by many indicates not only their beauty but also their captivating power.\n\nIn a deeper sense, this Kural reflects the intense emotions of love where every beautiful thing in nature reminds one of their beloved. The poet's heart is so deeply affected by her gaze that it sees a reflection of her eyes in every beautiful flower. This verse thus captures the profound and all-consuming nature of love. \n\nAdditionally, the Kural subtly hints at the shared experience of beauty. Just as many people admire the beauty of flowers, the lover feels that the beauty of his beloved's eyes is universally captivating and worthy of admiration. This shared experience of beauty ties individuals together, highlighting the unifying power of love and beauty.\n.The kural verse:முறிமேனி முத்தம் முறுவல் வெறிநாற்றம்வேலுண்கண் வேய்த்தோ ளவட்கு. ,translates to :The bamboo-shouldered has pearl-like smiles Fragrant breath and lance-like eyes,and it's explantion is :The verse 1113 of Thirukkural describes a man's admiration for his beloved's beauty. Here, the lady's physical features are metaphorically compared to beautiful elements of nature and precious objects.\n\nHer complexion is likened to the freshness and tenderness of a shoot, signifying her youthfulness and vibrancy. Her teeth are compared to pearls, indicating their whiteness and perfection. The metaphor of her breath being pleasant suggests her purity and attractiveness, and it may also refer to her speech being sweet and enchanting.\n\nThe phrase \"bamboo-shouldered\" is a metaphor comparing the lady's slender and graceful shoulders to the elegance and strength of bamboo. Her eyes are described as being as sharp and striking as a spear, implying her captivating and intense gaze.\n\nThus, this verse illustrates the lover's deep infatuation with his beloved, as he finds her every feature enchantingly beautiful. It also reflects the poet's skill in using vivid metaphors and similes to depict the beauty and charm of the lady. This verse is a fine example of the exquisite poetic tradition in Tamil literature, where physical beauty is often depicted through comparisons with elements of nature and precious objects..The kural verse:காணின் குவளை கவிழ்ந்து நிலன்நோக்கும்மாணிழை கண்ணொவ்வேம் என்று. ,translates to :Lily droops down to ground and says I can't equal the jewelled-one's eyes,and it's explantion is :Kural 1114 is a beautiful verse that uses metaphoric language to express an intense admiration for the beauty of a beloved's eyes. In this Kural, Valluvar compares the eyes of the beloved to the exquisite beauty of a blue lotus flower. But he goes on to suggest that even if the blue lotus could see, it would bow its head in humility and admit that it could never match the captivating beauty of the beloved's eyes.\n\nThe verse is a testament to the depth of the poet's love and admiration for his beloved. It demonstrates the poet's ability to see beauty beyond the physical appearance, delving into the realm of emotional and spiritual connections. The comparison of eyes to a lotus is a common trope in Tamil literature, symbolizing depth, beauty, and mystery.\n\nThe Kural also underscores the theme of humility. Even the most beautiful of flowers, if it could perceive, would be humble before the unparalleled beauty of the beloved's eyes. This metaphor serves to elevate the beloved's beauty while also promoting modesty and humility as virtues.\n\nIn a broader sense, this Kural can also be interpreted as the humility one should practice when recognizing the supreme power of the divine. Just like the lotus acknowledging the superiority of the beloved's eyes, humans should also acknowledge the greatness of the divine power. \n\nIn conclusion, Kural 1114 is a romantic verse that uses the metaphor of a lotus flower to express admiration for a beloved's eyes, while also promoting the virtues of humility and reverence..The kural verse:அனிச்சப்பூக் கால்களையாள் பெய்தாள் நுகப்பிற்குநல்ல படாஅ பறை. ,translates to :Anicha flower with stem she wears To her breaking waist sad-drum-blares!,and it's explantion is :Thiru Kural 1115 is a metaphorical verse that underscores the importance of carefulness and wisdom in one's actions. \n\nThe verse uses the imagery of a woman who has adorned herself with the anicham flower, a flower known for its fragile nature and sharp stem, without removing the stem. The woman, in her haste or ignorance, has not taken the care to remove the sharp stem, which can cause discomfort or even injury. \n\nThe \"merry drums\" that will not be beaten for her refers to the praise and celebration that would normally accompany a woman's beauty and grace. But because of her careless action, there is no cause for such celebration. Instead, the implications are negative and potentially painful.\n\nThis verse can be interpreted as a cautionary tale, reminding us of the potential consequences of hasty and unthoughtful actions. Just as the woman may suffer because she did not take the time to remove the harmful stem, so too can we suffer negative consequences when we act without careful consideration. The verse encourages us to act with wisdom, foresight, and care in all that we do..The kural verse:மதியும் மடந்தை முகனும் அறியாபதியின் கலங்கிய மீன். ,translates to :Stars are confused to know which is The moon and which is woman's face,and it's explantion is :Kural 1116 is a poetic and romantic verse by Thiruvalluvar. It showcases the beauty of a woman, comparing it to the moon, a common motif in Tamil literature, often used to symbolize elegance and beauty.\n\nIn this verse, Thiruvalluvar paints a vivid picture of a beautiful maiden, whose face is so radiant and captivating that it confuses the stars in the sky. They can't distinguish between the glow of the moon and the radiance of her face. The metaphorical 'stars' are portrayed as 'confused' and 'bewildered', unable to maintain their places in the sky, symbolizing how the woman's beauty has disrupted the natural order of the universe. \n\nThe underlying moral might be to highlight the power and impact of true beauty, which is not just skin deep, but also reflective of one's inner goodness. It underscores how compelling charm can bewitch even the celestial bodies, disrupting their routine course. \n\nMoreover, this verse also stands as a testament to the depth of the poet's admiration and love for the woman, as he places her allure on par with the moon, a celestial body traditionally associated with beauty, grace, and serenity. The verse is a classic example of Thiruvalluvar's poetic brilliance and his ability to weave ordinary human emotions with cosmic events..The kural verse:அறுவாய் நிறைந்த அவிர்மதிக்குப் க்குப் போலமறுவுண்டோ மாதர் முகத்து. ,translates to :Are there spots on the lady's face Just as in moon that changes phase?,and it's explantion is :Thirukkural 1117 is a verse from the \"Love\" chapter, where Valluvar is imaginatively describing the beauty of a woman. \n\nThis verse is a metaphorical comparison between the face of a woman and the bright full moon. The poet is querying if there could be any spots or blemishes on the lady's face, similar to the spots we see on the full moon. \n\nThe full moon, despite its craters and spots, is often admired for its luminous beauty and peaceful aura. The dark spots, in fact, contribute to the moon's charm by adding depth and character, making it imperfectly perfect. The poet uses this imagery to describe the woman's beauty - she is so beautiful that even if there were any spots or blemishes on her face, they would only add to her charm, much like the moon.\n\nThe verse is a celebration of unique beauty, where imperfections are embraced as part of the whole. It's an assertion that true beauty is not about being flawless, but about embracing and owning one's uniqueness and individuality. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can also be interpreted as a comment on human nature, where our flaws and imperfections make us who we are, adding to our individuality and uniqueness. It teaches us to accept ourselves and others as we are, without seeking perfection..The kural verse:மாதர் முகம்போல் ஒளிவிட வல்லையேல்காதலை வாழி மத஧. ,translates to :Like my lady's face if you shine All my love to you; hail O moon!,and it's explantion is :Kural 1118 is a beautifully crafted verse that expresses the depth of the poet's love towards his beloved. The poet addresses the moon, which is known for its soft, gentle glow, and challenges it to shine as brightly as his lover's face. He implies that his lover's face is so radiant and beautiful that even the moon's glow pales in comparison. \n\nThe poet further states that if the moon could indeed shine as brilliantly as his lover's face, then it would be worth his love. This is a metaphorical way of saying that his lover's beauty is so unparalleled that even the moon, often considered a symbol of beauty and radiance, would need to match her luminosity to gain his affection. \n\nThis verse highlights the profoundness of the poet's love for his beloved and the extraordinary beauty of his lover, which is metaphorically compared to a celestial body. It's a poetic expression of the absolute admiration and deep love the poet harbors for his lover. The poet's words also implicitly underscore his preference for inner beauty and radiance over superficial attractiveness. \n\nIn a broader interpretation, this verse can be seen as emphasizing the importance of inner glow (virtue, wisdom, kindness) over outer appearances, suggesting that genuine love and admiration are earned through inner beauty and not mere physical appearance..The kural verse:மலரன்ன கண்ணாள் முகமொத்தி யாயின்பலர்காணத் தோன்றல் மதி. ,translates to :Like the face of my flower-eyed one If you look, then shine alone O moon!,and it's explantion is :The verse (Kural 1119) is a romantic expression of the poet's deep adoration for his beloved. The poet addresses the moon, personifying it and comparing it to his lover's face. \n\nIn this verse, the poet's beloved has eyes that are as beautiful as blooming flowers, and he compares her face to the radiance of the moon. He seeks a unique attribute of the moon and implies that if it wants to match the beauty of his beloved's face, it should not appear to be seen by everyone. \n\nThis is a metaphorical way of expressing his possessiveness and deep love for his beloved. He wishes that her beauty should be exclusive, to be seen and admired only by him, just like how the moon is not visible to everyone at all times.\n\nThe verse illustrates a common theme in classical love poetry, where celestial bodies are often used to describe the beauty of the loved one. It also reflects the cultural context of the Thiru Kural, where such metaphors and personifications are frequently employed to express complex emotions. \n\nIn a broader moral interpretation, this verse can be seen as a reminder of the importance of exclusivity and commitment in a loving relationship. The poet's desire for his beloved's beauty to be seen only by him can be taken as a metaphor for the idea of cherishing and protecting what is dear to us..The kural verse:அனிச்சமும் அன்னத்தின் தூவியும் மாதர்அடிக்கு நெருஞ்சிப் பழம். ,translates to :The soft flower and the swan's down are Like nettles to the feet of the fair,and it's explantion is :Kural 1120 is a romantic verse from the Thiru Kural that uses vivid and tender imagery to express the delicate nature of a woman's feet. The verse states that the feet of a woman are so delicate and tender that even the softest of things - the anicham flower and the feathers of a swan, feel rough and prickly like the fruit of the Nerunji plant, a thorny fruit known for its hardness and rough texture.\n\nThe verse is a comparison to express the gentleness and fragility of a woman's feet. It illustrates the poet's deep affection and concern for his beloved, emphasizing the care and gentleness needed when interacting with her.\n\nThe cultural context here is the traditional Indian concept of romantic love where the beloved is cherished and treated with extreme delicacy and respect. The verse also brings out the poet's ability to observe and appreciate the finer details of his beloved's physical attributes, which is a key aspect of traditional Tamil romantic literature.\n\nIn a broader moral context, the verse can also be interpreted as a reminder to treat others, especially those who are delicate and vulnerable, with kindness and gentleness..The kural verse:பாலொடு தேன்கலந் தற்றே பணிமொழிவாலெயிறு ஊறிய நீர். ,translates to :Like milk and honey the dew is sweet From her white teeth whose word is soft,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 1121, from the Thirukkural is a poetic expression of admiration and love. The poet uses vivid imagery to describe the speech of a lady, likening it to an ambrosial blend of milk and honey.\n\nThe 'water that oozes from the white teeth' is a metaphorical representation of the words spoken by the lady. Her speech is described as being soft and pleasant, akin to the sweetness of milk and honey. This is a common metaphor used in classical Tamil literature to describe the sweetness and charm of a beloved's words.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the allure of sweet speech and gentle words, portraying them as not merely pleasing to the ear, but also nourishing and delightful to the soul, just like a mixture of milk and honey would be to the taste buds. \n\nThus, the poet beautifully encapsulates the power of kind and soft speech and the profound impact it can have on the listener, making it a sweet and unforgettable experience..The kural verse:உடம்பொடு உயிரிடை என்னமற் றன்னமடந்தையொடு எம்மிடை நட்பு. ,translates to :Love between me and this lady Is like bond between soul and body,and it's explantion is :Kural 1122 explores the depth and inseparability of true love, comparing it to the unity of the body and soul. The verse suggests that just as the body and soul are inherently connected and cannot exist separately, the love between the speaker and their beloved is so profound that they cannot be thought of as distinct entities. \n\nThis comparison draws on the traditional Indian philosophical belief that the soul is the life-giving aspect of the body, and their unity forms a complete being. In a similar way, the speaker and their beloved, through their profound love and companionship, have become a single entity. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse underscores the ideal of a deeply connected, inseparable bond in romantic relationships, a bond that transcends superficial attractions and is as vital and profound as the relationship between the body and the soul. \n\nThe different Tamil explanations provided expand on this concept, emphasizing this inseparability and the deep, enduring nature of such a love. They suggest that the bond between the speaker and their beloved is as natural, essential, and enduring as the bond between the body and the soul..The kural verse:கருமணியிற் பாவாய்நீ போதாயாம் வீழும்திருநுதற்கு இல்லை இடம். ,translates to :Depart image in my pupil Giving room to my fair-browed belle!,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse is a poetic expression of intense love and longing. The poet is addressing the image of a peacock (pavai) which is often seen reflected in the black pupil of the eye (karumanam in Tamil). The peacock here serves as a metaphor for an unwanted image or thought that occupies the mind. \n\nThe poet beseeches this image to depart, saying, \"O you image in the pupil of my eye, depart!\" The reason for this plea is due to the poet's desire to make space for the sight of his beloved, the one he cherishes the most. The phrase \"there is no room for my fair-browed beloved\" implies that the poet's mind and sight are so filled with this unwanted image (peacock) that there is no space left for the image of his beloved.\n\nThis verse articulates the depth of the poet's affection and longing for his beloved. It also communicates a sense of pain or regret at being consumed by an undesired thought or image, which prevents him from focusing on what he truly cherishes. \n\nThe cultural context of this verse lies in the poetic tradition of using metaphors and symbols to express complex emotions. The peacock, with its vivid colors and striking beauty, is also seen as a distraction, preventing the poet from beholding the beauty of his loved one. This verse, therefore, emphasizes the power of love and the anguish of separation..The kural verse:வாழ்தல் உயிர்க்கன்னள் ஆயிழை சாதல்அதற்கன்னள் நீங்கும் இடத்து. ,translates to :Life with my jewel is existence Death it is her severance,and it's explantion is :This Thirukkural verse is a poignant expression of deep love and attachment. The poet likens his beloved, adorned with carefully chosen ornaments, to his own soul. When she is with him, it feels as if his soul is in union with his body, symbolizing a state of completeness, harmony, and joy. \n\nHowever, when she departs from him, it is as if his soul is leaving his body, representing a state of deep sorrow, loss and devastation. It is a metaphorical way of expressing how lifeless and incomplete he feels without her. This verse encapsulates the profound intimacy and the pain of separation in love, emphasizing that true love is so integral to one's existence, just like the soul is to the body. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse also illustrates the ancient Tamil ethos of romantic love, where the beloved is not merely an object of desire, but an essential part of one's self, whose presence or absence can impact one's very existence..The kural verse:உள்ளுவன் மன்யான் மறப்பின் மறப்பறியேன்ஒள்ளமர்க் கண்ணாள் குணம். ,translates to :Can I forget? I recall always The charms of her bright battling eyes,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural speaks about the depth of love and devotion. It expresses a lover's deep affection towards his beloved, who is described as having bright, beautiful eyes that are spirited and full of life, much like a warrior in the battlefield.\n\nThe protagonist addresses the maid of his beloved, stating that if he ever forgot the virtues of his beloved, only then would he be able to remember the maid. The idea here is that his memory is so filled with thoughts of his beloved and her virtues that there is no room left to think of anyone else. He admits that he never forgets his cherished one, hence he is unable to remember the maid.\n\nThe verse captures the essence of deep love where the lover is so engrossed in the thoughts of his beloved that he forgets the existence of others. It emphasizes the exclusivity of true love and also serves as a metaphor for spiritual devotion, where the devotee is so immersed in the divine that they forget the worldly distractions.\n\nIn essence, this Kural highlights the power of love and its capacity to consume one's thoughts entirely, leaving no room for any other memory or thought. It is a testament to the depth of true love and devotion, whether towards a beloved or divinity..The kural verse:கண்ணுள்ளின் போகார் இமைப்பின் பருகுவராநுண்ணியர்எம் காத லவர். ,translates to :So subtle is my lover's form Ever in my eyes winking, no harm,and it's explantion is :This couplet or Kural 1126, belongs to the chapter of \"Impressions of Love\", where the poetess expresses the intensity and depth of her love towards her beloved. The verse metaphorically depicts how inseparable and profound her love is.\n\nIn the first line, \"My lover would not depart from mine eyes\", the poetess symbolically describes the constant presence of her beloved in her vision. No matter where she looks or what she does, she always sees him, indicating his deep-rooted place in her heart and mind. \n\nThe second line, \"even if I wink, he would not suffer (from pain)\", further enhances this sentiment. The act of blinking or winking usually suggests a temporary interruption in sight. However, in her case, even this minor action does not affect the continuous vision of her beloved, as he is so engraved in her thoughts.\n\nIn the final part of the verse, \"he is so ethereal\", the beloved is referred to as being ethereal, meaning that he is not just a physical entity, but an essential part of her being, her consciousness, existing beyond the physical realm. It emphasizes the spiritual and transcendent nature of their love.\n\nOverall, this couplet beautifully portrays the profound love and deep connection between the poetess and her beloved, where the beloved is not just a person, but a constant, ethereal presence that transcends the physical world. It emphasizes that true love is not just about physical proximity but about a deeper, spiritual connection..The kural verse:கண்ணுள்ளார் காத லவராகக் கண்ணும்எழுதேம் கரப்பாக்கு அறிந்து. ,translates to :My lover in my eyes abides I paint them not lest he hides,and it's explantion is :Kural 1127 is a beautiful expression of the depth of love and longing in a romantic relationship. The verse suggests the lover's presence is so deeply felt that they seem to exist within the speaker's very eyes. This metaphorical expression conveys the omnipresence of the beloved in the lover's life, to the extent that the beloved feels inseparable from their own being.\n\nThe speaker refuses to even apply paint (or kohl) to their eyes, a common cosmetic practice in ancient Tamil society, out of the fear that it might cause their beloved to hide. This signifies the lover's desire to always see and feel their beloved, without any obstructions or distractions.\n\nThe underlying message of this verse is the profound emotional connection between lovers, where they perceive each other as an integral part of their existence. It portrays the deep sense of longing and the fear of separation in love. The verse is a testament to the intensity of love that permeates every aspect of life, even mundane tasks like applying makeup. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can also be seen as a metaphor for devotion and dedication, where one chooses to renounce even the smallest pleasures or habits for the sake of their beloved or their passion. It's a portrayal of the sacrifices one is willing to make in the name of love or devotion..The kural verse:நெஞ்சத்தார் காத லவராக வெய்துண்டல்அஞ்சுதும் வேபாக் கறிந்து. ,translates to :My lover abides in my heart I fear hot food lest he feels hot,and it's explantion is :Kural 1128 is a beautiful representation of the intense emotional bond that characterizes love. The verse metaphorically expresses how deeply the poet feels connected to his beloved. He says that his loved one resides in his heart so profoundly that he fears consuming anything hot, as he believes it would cause discomfort to his beloved. \n\nThe verse highlights the empathetic nature of love, where one feels the other's joy and pain as their own. The anxiety about causing harm to the loved one, even in such an indirect manner, shows the depth of the attachment. \n\nIt's a depiction of the kind of love that blurs the boundaries between the self and the other, making their happiness and discomfort, their pain and pleasure, intimately interwoven with one's own feelings. \n\nIn a broader sense, it reminds us of the need for empathy and consideration in all our relationships. The sensitivity towards the other's feelings, the willingness to put their comfort before our desires, can make any relationship more loving and harmonious..The kural verse:இமைப்பின் கரப்பாக்கு அறிவல் அனைத்திற்கேஏதிலர் என்னும் இவ் வூர். ,translates to :My eyes wink not lest he should hide And him as cruel the townsmen chide,and it's explantion is :Kural 1129 explores the depth of the poet's love for their beloved. The speaker expresses a fear of blinking, as they believe their beloved would disappear in that fleeting moment when their eyes are closed. The love they have is so intense and consuming that they wish not to miss even a second of gazing upon their beloved. \n\nHowever, the townspeople, who are not privy to this depth of emotion, misunderstand the situation. They misinterpret the lover's unwillingness to blink as indifference or lack of love. They fail to understand that this is, in fact, an expression of an immense love that fears the briefest separation. \n\nThis verse is a commentary on how love, in its profound form, can be misinterpreted by those who are not experiencing it. It also underscores the fear of loss that comes with deep affection, and how love can be so overwhelming that it may defy conventional behaviors, like blinking..The kural verse:உவந்துறைவர் உள்ளத்துள் என்றும் இகந்துறைவர்ஏதிலர் என்னும் இவ் வூர். ,translates to :He abides happy in my heart But people mistake he is apart,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural alludes to the profound and intimate bond between lovers, which is often misunderstood by those outside this relationship.\n\nThe poetess is expressing that her lover resides in her heart, bringing her constant joy and delight. This signifies the deep emotional connection they share, where the beloved is not merely a physical entity but an integral part of her inner self. Their bond transcends physical presence, and she carries him within her heart wherever she goes.\n\nHowever, the townsfolk, lacking this intimate understanding, mistake their emotional closeness for physical distance. They judge their relationship based on external appearances and erroneously perceive her lover as being unloving and distant. This reflects societal judgments, which often misinterpret the intricacies of personal, intimate relationships.\n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes the private and subjective nature of love, which can be truly understood only by those who experience it. It also gently critiques societal norms that judge relationships based on superficial appearances rather than their emotional depth..The kural verse:காமம் உழந்து வருந்தினார்க்கு ஏமம்மடலல்லது இல்லை வலி. ,translates to :Pangs of passion find no recourse Except riding *`palmyra horse' * Palmyra horse or 'Madal' is a torture expressive of the burning passion of the lover to the beloved The lover's body is laid on a rough pricking palmyra bed and he is carried along the street with songs of love pangs The parents of the lovers first reproach them and then consent to their marriage,and it's explantion is :The verse, Kural 1131, speaks about the intensity of unfulfilled love and the suffering it can cause. It uses a metaphor of a \"palmyra horse\" to illustrate the situation. \n\nIn the Tamil culture, a \"palmyra horse\" refers to a traditional punishment or penance where a person suffering from guilt or seeking atonement is made to ride a rough, wooden horse-like structure made from the hard trunk of the Palmyra tree. This act is painful and serves as a physical manifestation of their internal suffering.\n\nThiruvalluvar, the poet, uses this metaphor to depict the pain of those who have experienced the pleasures of love and are left yearning for more but are unable to attain it. The despair and agony they go through is akin to the pain of riding the palmyra horse. \n\nThe poet implies that the only remedy for such a situation is to endure the pain, just like how one would endure the pain of riding the palmyra horse. It suggests the idea that suffering is a part of life, especially when it comes to love, and one must learn to endure it. \n\nThus, in a broader sense, this verse emphasizes the need for resilience and endurance in the face of emotional distress and unfulfilled desires..The kural verse:நோனா உடம்பும் உயிரும் மடலேறும்நாணினை நீக்கி நிறுத்து. ,translates to :Pining body and mind lose shame And take to riding of the palm,and it's explantion is :Kural 1132 provides a vivid metaphorical depiction of the agony of separation in love. The verse essentially says that when the pain of separation from the loved one becomes unbearable, both the body and the soul, shedding their sense of shame, are ready to mount the \"palmyra horse\". \n\nThe \"palmyra horse\" is a metaphor for a gallows or a noose made from the palmyra tree, commonly used in ancient Tamil culture for committing suicide. The reference to this drastic measure signifies the depth of despair and the intensity of the pain experienced by the love-stricken person.\n\nIn essence, the verse highlights the extreme emotional distress that one can experience due to separation in love, to the point of contemplating suicide. It underscores the importance of emotional balance and the need for supportive mechanisms to handle such extreme emotional states. It also implicitly cautions about the dangers of losing oneself completely in love, to the point of neglecting one's own life..The kural verse:நாணொடு நல்லாண்மை பண்டுடையேன் இன்றுடையேன்காமுற்றார் ஏறும் மடல். ,translates to :Once I was modest and manly My love has now Madal only,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural is about the transformative power of romantic love or lust. The poet says that once he was full of dignity and manliness, but now he has become like a palmyra horse, which is traditionally associated with lustful behaviour.\n\nThe 'palmyra horse' is a metaphor, used to describe a person who is ridden or controlled by their desires. The 'horse' is an emblem of uncontrolled passion and the poet uses it to indicate how much he has changed. He admits that he has let go of his modesty and manliness, allowing his desires to take over him.\n\nThe verse is a reflection on the power of love or lust to change a person's behavior and character. It highlights how unchecked passions can lead to loss of self-control and dignity. It is a cautionary note about the danger of letting desires control one's actions and behaviour, suggesting the need for balance and self-discipline. \n\nIn a broader cultural context, this verse also reflects the ancient Tamil society's view on the importance of modesty and manliness as desirable virtues, and the potential risks of succumbing to uncontrolled desires..The kural verse:காமக் கடும்புனல் உய்க்கும் நாணொடுநல்லாண்மை என்னும் புணை. ,translates to :Rushing flood of love sweeps away The raft of shame and firmness, aye!,and it's explantion is :This Kural, number 1134, speaks of the overpowering nature of lust and its capacity to sweep away even the most robust traits of modesty and manliness. The verse uses the metaphor of a raft being carried away by a strong current to illustrate how lust can engulf an individual and strip them of their virtues.\n\nIn the verse, the 'raft' symbolizes the virtues of modesty and manliness which are considered to be anchors of moral character. However, the 'strong current of lust' signifies the overpowering and consuming nature of desire. Just as a strong current can easily sweep away a raft, the powerful force of lust can easily erode and carry away one's modesty and manliness. \n\nHence, the Kural warns about the destructive potential of uncontrolled lust. It emphasizes the importance of self-restraint and the need to safeguard one's virtues from being swept away by lustful desires. It further underscores the idea that maintaining modesty and manliness requires constant vigilance and moral strength, especially in the face of strong, negative forces such as lust..The kural verse:தொடலைக் குறுந்தொடி தந்தாள் மடலொடுமாலை உழக்கும் துயர். ,translates to :Palm-ride and pangs of eventide Are gifts of wreath-like bracelet maid,and it's explantion is :Kural 1135 is a beautiful representation of the romantic longing and sorrow experienced by a lover. In this verse, Valluvar uses symbolic imagery to express the pain of separation and longing for the beloved.\n\nThe kural begins with the image of a woman adorned with small garland-like bracelets. This is a reference to the beloved, who is portrayed as delicate and beautiful. The mention of the \"palmyra horse\" is a metaphorical representation of the lover's heart, suggesting that his emotions are as uncontrollable as a wild horse.\n\nThe latter part of the verse refers to the \"sorrow that is endured at night.\" This is a common theme in classical Tamil literature, where the night is often associated with painful separation and longing. The night time is depicted as a period of intense loneliness and yearning, where the lover is left alone with his thoughts and emotions.\n\nThe verse essentially conveys that the beloved has gifted the lover with two things - the uncontrollable emotions akin to a wild horse and the sorrow of nights filled with longing. Here, the gift is not physical, but emotional, emphasizing the profound impact of love and longing on the human heart. \n\nThus, the verse beautifully encapsulates the paradox of love - it is both a source of immense joy and profound sorrow. It is a testament to Valluvar's deep understanding of human emotions and the complexities of love..The kural verse:மடலூர்தல் யாமத்தும் உள்ளுவேன் மன்றபடல்ஒல்லா பேதைக்கென் கண். ,translates to :Madal I ride at midnight for My eyes sleep not seeing this fair,and it's explantion is :The Thiru Kural verse 1136 speaks about the profound intensity of love and longing. The speaker expresses how the affection for their beloved is so strong that it keeps them awake at night. The phrase \"mounting the palmyra horse\" is a metaphor that refers to a traditional Tamil practice where a lover would boldly ride a palmyra horse (made of palm leaves) to his beloved's house as a proclamation of his love, even in the midnight hour.\n\nThe verse encapsulates the state of sleepless nights due to the separation from the beloved and the continuous contemplation of proclaiming his love fearlessly. The speaker's eyes refuse to close in sleep, indicating the depth of yearning and the incessant thoughts of the loved one. There is an intense determination to take a bold step to express the love, as indicated by the thought of \"mounting the palmyra horse\" even at midnight.\n\nThis verse emphasizes the power of love and its ability to dominate one's thoughts and actions. It also symbolizes the courage that love instills in a person, making them ready to take bold steps and face any challenges that come their way..The kural verse:கடலன்ன காமம் உழந்தும் மடலேறாப்பெண்ணின் பெருந்தக்க தில். ,translates to :Her sea-like lust seeks not Madal! Serene is woman's self control,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1137 celebrates the dignity and self-control of a woman, even when faced with overwhelming desire or lust. This verse uses the metaphor of a sea to symbolise intense lust, and the 'palmyra horse' as a symbol for losing control or giving into lustful desires. \n\nThe verse asserts that there is nothing more commendable than a woman who, despite being submerged in a 'sea of lust', refuses to 'ride the palmyra horse', meaning she does not surrender her self-control or dignity. Indeed, such a woman's virtue and strength is celebrated as unparalleled in this verse.\n\nIn a broader context, this verse is a testament to the strength of character that is required to maintain one's integrity in the face of intense temptation. It serves as a reminder that maintaining self-control in all aspects of life, including our desires, is a virtue to be admired and upheld..The kural verse:நிறையரியர் மன்அளியர் என்னாது காமம்மறையிறந்து மன்று படும். ,translates to :Lust betrays itself in haste Though women are highly soft and chaste,and it's explantion is :The verse 1138 of Thiru Kural speaks about the overwhelming and all-consuming nature of passion, or 'kaamam'. Here, Valluvar uses personification to depict 'kaamam' as an entity that disregards the chastity and modesty of women and makes itself known in public.\n\nIn the cultural context, this verse can be seen as a commentary on the societal norms of the time. In traditional Tamil society, women were expected to be chaste and modest and to maintain a certain level of decorum in public. This verse acknowledges that 'kaamam' or passion can sometimes overshadow these societal expectations, causing women to behave in ways that might be considered inappropriate by society.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Valluvar isn't criticizing or condemning women. Instead, he's commenting on the powerful nature of passion and how it can drive people to act against societal norms. This verse serves as a reminder of the importance of self-control and discipline in managing our passions and desires. \n\nSo, to sum it up, this verse tells us about the power of passion - it can be so strong that it forgets the societal norms, disregards the modesty of women, and makes itself evident in public. It's a call for understanding the power of emotions and an urge for managing them wisely..The kural verse:அறிகிலார் எல்லாரும் என்றேஎன் காமம்மறுகின் மறுகும் மருண்டு. ,translates to :My perplexed love roves public street Believing that none knows its secret,and it's explantion is :Kural 1139 explores the theme of love and its uncontrollable nature. It can be interpreted as the poet expressing his intense passion and desire that is so overpowering, it seems to have a life of its own. \n\nThe verse suggests that his love is so profound and overwhelming that it behaves like a restless entity, roaming around in public spaces, almost like a person lost and bewildered. This metaphorical wandering of love signifies its urgency and desperation to be recognized and reciprocated.\n\nMoreover, the poet uses the phrase 'unknown to all but me' to illustrate the secretive and personal nature of his feelings. It suggests that his love is so deeply personal and intense that no one else can truly comprehend its depth, not until it's openly expressed.\n\nIn essence, the verse depicts the torment of unexpressed love. It underscores the poet's struggle to contain his feelings and the resulting turmoil that his love undergoes, appearing to wander aimlessly, seeking recognition and reciprocation. The verse also underscores the universal human experience of intense love - the difficulty of concealing it and the desire for it to be known and returned..The kural verse:யாம்கண்ணின் காண நகுப அறிவில்லார்யாம்பட்ட தாம்படா ஆறு. ,translates to :Fools laugh at me before my eyes For they feel not my pangs and sighs,and it's explantion is :Kural 1140 highlights the insensitivity and lack of understanding that people often exhibit towards others' pain, especially when they haven't experienced similar suffering themselves. The verse suggests that some people might even find amusement in the distress of others, primarily due to their inability to empathize, as they haven't endured similar hardships.\n\nThe verse metaphorically depicts a situation where a person suffering from the pangs of love sees others laughing at them, not out of malice but ignorance. They are oblivious to the depth of the pain that the person is experiencing. This scenario can be extended to general suffering too. Often, those who haven't experienced a particular form of distress might fail to comprehend its severity, leading them to react inappropriately, even with laughter.\n\nThiruvalluvar, through this verse, advocates for empathy and understanding. He subtly implores individuals to refrain from making light of others' suffering, highlighting the importance of compassion in human interactions..The kural verse:அலரெழ ஆருயிர் நிற்கும் அதனைப்பலரறியார் பாக்கியத் தால். ,translates to :Rumour sustains my existence Good luck! many know not its sense,and it's explantion is :Kural 1141 deals with the theme of love and the power of rumors related to it. The poet presents an interesting perspective on how rumors, which are generally seen as detrimental, can sometimes play a beneficial role.\n\nIn this verse, the poet says, \"My precious life is saved by the raise of rumors, and this, to my good luck, no others are aware of\". This implies that the rumors about the speaker's love are keeping their hope alive and helping them to cope with the situation. The rumors about their love affair are spreading in the society, keeping their love alive in the minds of people and hence, in a way, protecting their love from dying out.\n\nWhat's more, these rumors are unknown to many, which the speaker sees as a stroke of good luck. This means that while the rumors are keeping their love alive, they are not causing any harm, as they are unnoticed by many. It is a subtle commentary on how societal perception and talk can impact the dynamics of a love relationship.\n\nIn a nutshell, the verse shows how rumors, despite their negative connotation, can sometimes be a savior, especially in the context of love and relationships. It also sheds light on the societal dynamics of love, where public opinion and rumors can play a significant role in shaping the course of a love affair..The kural verse:மலரன்ன கண்ணாள் அருமை அறியாதுஅலரெமக்கு ஈந்ததிவ் வூர். ,translates to :Rumour gives me the flower-like belle People know not what rare angel,and it's explantion is :Kural 1142 speaks of the societal perception and misunderstanding of love. The poet expresses his displeasure and irony at the town's inability to understand the beauty and value of the woman he admires, who has eyes as enchanting as flowers. \n\nThe townspeople, not understanding the depth of their affection, have gossiped about their relationship, misconstruing his admiration for something more casual or trivial. They fail to grasp the profound respect and admiration he holds for her. Yet, the poet finds an ironic benefit in this misunderstanding. The rumors, intended to belittle or defame, have inadvertently helped him. They have brought him closer to the woman he admires, strengthening their bond and deepening his love for her.\n\nThis kural subtly critiques societal norms and judgements, highlighting the often misguided and superficial understanding of love by society. It also underlines the power of love, how it can turn even rumors and misconceptions into something beneficial for the lovers..The kural verse:உறாஅதோ ஊரறிந்த கெளவை அதனைப்பெறாஅது பெற்றன்ன நீர்த்து. ,translates to :I profit by this public rumour Having not, I feel, I have her,and it's explantion is :Kural 1143 essentially discusses the power of rumors and public perception. The protagonist is asking a rhetorical question - wouldn't he hear a rumor that is well-known throughout the town? He then expresses that even though he hasn't received the object of his desire (presumably love), the very rumor of it feels as if he's already obtained it.\n\nThis verse essentially brings out the human tendency to find joy in anticipation and the power of public perception. The protagonist is not yet in possession of his desire, but the widespread rumor of it gives him an illusion of its possession, thus bringing him joy and satisfaction.\n\nIt is also worth noting that in ancient Tamil society, public opinion played a significant role in personal relationships and this verse reflects that aspect of the culture. Hence, the joy he feels is not just from the anticipation of his desire but also from the societal validation that comes along with it.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse could be seen as a commentary on how we often let public opinion shape our personal feelings and experiences..The kural verse:கவ்வையால் கவ்விது காமம் அதுவின்றேல்தவ்வென்னும் தன்மை இழந்து. ,translates to :Rumour inflames the love I seek Or else it becomes bleak and weak,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural speaks about the power of rumors or talk on love and its intensity. It states that gossip or rumors amplify the intensity of passion or love. Without this external stimulation, the love might lose its vigor and fade away.\n\nThe verse highlights the human tendency to value something more when it's talked about, or seen as controversial or forbidden. These talks or rumors serve to heighten the emotions associated with the relationship, making it more intense and passionate. \n\nOn a deeper level, it also portrays the delicate balance between societal influences and personal emotions. In the absence of such external factors, the individuals may start to see their love in its raw form, which might not be as intense or appealing as it seemed under the influence of the society's chatter. \n\nIn a moral context, this verse can be seen as a caution against allowing external influences to dictate the course and intensity of one's feelings or relationships. It implies that true love should not be swayed by the whispers of society, but should stand on its own, driven by the emotions and commitment of the individuals involved..The kural verse:களித்தொறும் கள்ளுண்டல் வேட்டற்றால் காமம்வெளிப்படுந் தோறும் இனிது. ,translates to :Drink delights as liquor flows Love delights as rumour grows,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural talks about the joy of love, especially when it becomes a subject of conversation or rumours in the society. The poet compares this feeling to the delight one experiences when consuming alcohol in a state of happiness. Just as a person who enjoys drinking finds pleasure in it during times of merriment, so does a lover find joy in their love being talked about or becoming a subject of public interest. \n\nThe underlying sentiment here is the exhilaration and thrill that comes with love being acknowledged and discussed publicly. It highlights the human tendency to find delight in the attention and acknowledgement of our emotions. The comparison to the enjoyment of alcohol underlines the intense pleasure and intoxicating effect of love, especially when it is shared or becomes a part of public discourse. \n\nThus, the verse is a celebration of love, its potent effects, and the joy it brings when it is recognized and discussed by others..The kural verse:கண்டது மன்னும் ஒருநாள் அலர்மன்னும்திங்களைப் பாம்புகொண் டற்று. ,translates to :One lasting day we met alone Lasting rumours eclipse our moon,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural is a beautiful expression of love and the public's fascination with it. The verse suggests that even a single glance at one's beloved can cause a stir and become the talk of the town, spreading rapidly just like a rumor. The poet uses an interesting analogy of a snake seizing the moon, a folklore or mythological reference in the Indian context often referred to as \"Grahanam\", which is an eclipse. \n\nDuring an eclipse, it is believed that a demon or snake swallows the moon, causing darkness. This event is much talked about and creates a flutter among the masses. Similarly, the poet's single meeting or glance at the beloved has become a widespread rumor causing a similar flutter in their society.\n\nThis verse beautifully highlights the societal norms and restrictions prevalent during the poet's time, where even a simple meeting between lovers would become a subject of gossip. At the same time, it emphasizes the intense love the poet has for the beloved, where a single glance is as significant and impactful as a cosmic event..The kural verse:ஊரவர் கெளவை எருவாக அன்னைசொல்நீராக நீளும்இந் நோய். ,translates to :Scandal manures; mother's refrain Waters the growth of this love-pain,and it's explantion is :Kural 1147 explores the nature of unreciprocated love or lust, comparing it to a malady that continues to thrive and grow. The verse uses agricultural metaphors to convey this concept. The \"talk of women\" is compared to the manure that enriches the soil and allows crops to flourish. It means that the whispers, rumors, and talks about the beloved in society can often intensify and fuel the feelings of affection or lust in a person's heart.\n\nThe \"harsh words of my mother\" are compared to water, a vital element for the growth of a plant. This indicates that even the stern warnings and reprimands from a mother, which are meant to dissuade the individual from such feelings, ironically contribute to the growth of these emotions. Instead of quelling the feelings, they serve to heighten the emotional intensity and longing, much like how water, though necessary for growth, can also lead to overgrowth or flooding if mismanaged.\n\nIn essence, this verse portrays the irony of how societal gossip and parental admonishment, which ideally should deter a person from the path of unrequited love, end up nurturing and fuelling it instead. It is a commentary on the paradoxical nature of human emotions and the way societal and familial influences can often have unintended consequences..The kural verse:நெய்யால் எரிநுதுப்பேம் என்றற்றால் கெளவையால்காமம் நுதுப்பேம் எனல். ,translates to :To quench the lust by rumour free Is to quench fire by pouring ghee,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1148 is a metaphorical verse that speaks about the futility of trying to suppress or control one's passion or desire out of the fear of societal gossip or rumor. \n\nIn this verse, Valluvar uses the analogy of trying to extinguish a fire with ghee (clarified butter), which is known to only enhance the fire, rather than put it out. This metaphor is used to illustrate how futile and counterproductive it is to attempt to suppress or control one's desire or passion out of fear of societal rumor or gossip. It implies that such an attempt would only serve to intensify the passion or desire, just as adding ghee to a fire would only cause it to burn more fiercely.\n\nThe verse suggests that true restraint or control over one's desires and passions cannot be achieved through fear or external pressures, but must come from one's own inner understanding and self-control. \n\nIt is also a critique of the societal norms that often pressure individuals to suppress their true feelings or desires out of fear of gossip or judgment. Valluvar suggests that such societal pressures are not only ineffective in controlling desire, but can actually serve to intensify it. \n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes the importance of self-awareness, self-control, and authenticity in managing one's desires and passions, rather than succumbing to societal pressures or external influences..The kural verse:அலர்நாண ஒல்வதோ அஞ்சலோம்பு என்றார்பலர்நாண நீத்தக் கடை. ,translates to :Who said \\\"fear not\\\" flared up rumour Why then should I blush this clamour?,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1149 is a poignant expression of the pain of separation, betrayal, and the power of societal perceptions. The verse speaks about the agony of the loved one who has been left behind. \n\nThe verse's persona has been assured by their beloved, saying \"fear not\", a promise to stay together. However, the beloved has left, causing a sense of shame and humiliation in front of others. The question posed in the verse - \"why need I be ashamed of scandal?\" is a reflection of the internal struggle. The persona is questioning the need to feel shame for the gossip triggered by the beloved's departure, since the real pain comes from the betrayal of the promise made.\n\nIn essence, the verse is a critique of societal judgment and a plea for empathy. It underlines the fact that the pain of betrayal and the shame caused by societal judgement are two different things. The real hurt is not in the scandal or the societal judgement, but in the betrayal of the trusted one's departure. \n\nThis verse is also a commentary on the temporary nature of human promises and the permanent impact they can leave on someone's life. It is a call for sincerity and honesty in relationships, and the importance of keeping one's word. \n\nThe verse uses the term 'alar' which refers to gossip or scandal, illustrating the societal pressure and judgement that often accompany personal issues. It is a subtle critique of society's tendency to judge and shame individuals without understanding the depth of their personal pain and circumstances. It calls for more understanding and empathy in society, rather than judgement and scandal..The kural verse:தாம்வேண்டின் நல்குவர் காதலர் யாம்வேண்டும்கெளவை எடுக்கும்இவ் வூர். ,translates to :Town raising this cry, I desire Consent is easy from my sire,and it's explantion is :Kural 1150 explores the theme of love and longing in the context of societal approval. Here, Valluvar portrays the anticipation of a woman whose love interest has caught the attention of the townsfolk. The townsfolk discuss her beloved, raising rumors and talk, which is what she desires. \n\nThe verse suggests that public acknowledgment of her love interest increases her hope and anticipation, as the conversation surrounding him might eventually reach his ears, thereby making him aware of her feelings. The rumors serve as a medium to convey her affection indirectly. \n\nFurthermore, the verse suggests that her lover, when he becomes aware of her feelings, would reciprocate her love, if he desired. This reflects the cultural context of the times, where societal approval had a strong bearing on the progression of relationships. \n\nIn essence, this couplet beautifully illustrates the role of societal approval and rumors in building romantic relationships, reflecting the subtleties of love and longing during the time Valluvar wrote the Thiru Kural..The kural verse:செல்லாமை உண்டேல் எனக்குரை மற்றுநின்வல்வரவு வாழ்வார்க் குரை. ,translates to :Tell me if you but do not leave, Your quick return to those who live,and it's explantion is :Kural 1151 is a poignant expression of love and longing. In this couplet, the poet speaks from the perspective of a person who is pained by the departure of their loved one. The speaker is so deeply affected by the separation that they question the very possibility of their survival until their loved one's return.\n\n\"If it is not departure, tell me,\" suggests that the speaker is in a severe state of denial, unable to accept the reality of their lover's departure. They yearn for a comforting word, a promise that the separation is temporary.\n\n\"But if it is your speedy return, tell it to those who would be alive then,\" reveals the profound depth of their pain. The speaker is so tormented by the separation that they doubt their ability to survive until the beloved's return. They suggest that if the loved one promises to return quickly, that message should be passed on to those who would still be alive at that time, implying that they may not be among them due to the anguish of separation.\n\nThis verse beautifully encapsulates the agony of separation in love and the fearful anticipation of an uncertain future in the absence of the beloved. It reflects a universal human emotion, making it relatable across cultures and generations..The kural verse:இன்கண் உடைத்தவர் பார்வல் பிரிவஞ்சும்புன்கண் உடைத்தால் புணர்வு. ,translates to :His sight itself was pleasing, near Embrace pains now by partings fear,and it's explantion is :Kural 1152 delves into the depths of love and the consequential fear of separation experienced by lovers. The verse subtly conveys the pain of anticipated parting that often accompanies intense love. \n\nIn the past, merely the sight of the beloved used to bring immense joy and pleasure. However, as the bond deepens, the fear of separation sneaks in, transforming even the physical closeness into a source of pain. This is because the lovers start to worry about the inevitable parting that follows their union. The mere thought of separation overshadows the joy of being together, making even the most intimate moments filled with anxiety and fear.\n\nThis verse highlights the bittersweet nature of love, where joy and fear coexist. It illustrates the paradox that in love, the source of the greatest pleasure can also become the source of deep pain, demonstrating the profound emotional complexities involved in romantic relationships.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, through this verse, unveils the delicate balance of pleasure and pain in love, a sentiment universal to all lovers, transcending cultural and temporal boundaries..The kural verse:அரிதரோ தேற்றம் அறிவுடையார் கண்ணும்பிரிவோ ரிடத்துண்மை யான். ,translates to :On whom shall I lay my trust hence While parting lurks in knowing ones?,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse talks about the uncertainty and unpredictability in relationships, especially in love. The verse states that even an understanding lover, who knows the pain of separation, might sometimes choose to part ways. This unpredictable nature of relationships makes it hard to have unwavering confidence in the assurances given by the beloved. \n\nThe verse highlights the complexity of human emotions and relationships. It emphasizes that people's actions can be unpredictable, regardless of their understanding or intelligence. This can lead to uncertainty, making it difficult to trust their words or promises fully. This verse reminds us to be aware of this inherent uncertainty in relationships and encourages us to navigate them with wisdom and emotional resilience. \n\nIn the cultural context, the verse underscores the importance of emotional intelligence in managing relationships. It also reflects on the transient nature of human emotions and relationships and the need for emotional fortitude in dealing with the challenges that arise in relationships..The kural verse:அளித்தஞ்சல் என்றவர் நீப்பின் தெளித்தசொல்தேறியார்க்கு உண்டோ தவறு. ,translates to :He parts whose love told me -fear not Is my trust in him at default?,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural talks about the trust and faith in relationships, particularly in the context of love and companionship. The verse suggests that if a person, who once bestowed their love and assured another person to have no fear (indicating that they will always be there for them), decides to leave, then it should not be considered as the fault of the person who believed in their words.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of sincerity and integrity in our words and actions. When we assure someone of our love and support, they place their trust in us based on those words. If we break that trust by leaving them, it should not be the fault of those who trusted us, but rather, it is our failure to uphold our words.\n\nIn broader terms, this verse can be applied to any relationship or situation where trust and faith are involved. It underscores the moral responsibility that comes with giving assurances and making promises. It is a call to be truthful, reliable, and consistent in our interactions with others..The kural verse:ஓம்பின் அமைந்தார் பிரிவோம்பல் மற்றவர்நீங்கின் அரிதால் புணர்வு. ,translates to :Stop his parting -my life to save Meeting is rare if he would leave,and it's explantion is :Kural 1155 explores the deep emotional bond between two lovers, emphasizing the pain of separation and the longing for togetherness. The verse metaphorically represents the plea of a lover to their beloved, requesting them not to leave. The lover insists that if the beloved leaves, it would be almost impossible for them to reunite, hence affecting their relationship and emotional connection.\n\nThis Kural speaks volumes about the intensity of love and the profound impact of separation on the lovers. It underlines the fear of losing the beloved and the ensuing emotional turmoil that the fear of separation can cause. This verse beautifully captures the essence of love and longing, resonating with the universal human experience of love, longing, and fear of loss.\n\nIn a broader context, this verse can also be interpreted as the importance of maintaining strong bonds and relationships in our lives. It emphasizes that once a significant relationship is lost, it's challenging to rebuild it, hence encouraging us to cherish and preserve our relationships..The kural verse:பிரிவுரைக்கும் வன்கண்ணர் ஆயின் அரிதவர்நல்குவர் என்னும் நசை. ,translates to :His hardness says, \\\"I leave you now\\\" Is there hope of his renewed love?,and it's explantion is :Kural 1156 dives deep into the emotional landscape of separation and longing. The verse precisely talks about the futility of expecting affection from a person who is not just leaving, but is also determined and unflinching in his decision to depart.\n\nThe first line \"பிரிவுரைக்கும் வன்கண்ணர் ஆயின்\" refers to a person who is resolute in his decision to leave, and has the courage to openly express his intention of departure. The second line \"அரிதவர் நல்குவர் என்னும் நசை\" implies the futility of hoping that such a person would return and demonstrate affection.\n\nIn a broader perspective, this Kural teaches us the reality of life. It encourages us not to nurture false hope or expectation from those who have clearly expressed their intent of departure. It's a lesson about the acceptance of reality and making peace with the circumstances, even if they are painful. It underscores the significance of emotional independence and self-reliance, rather than being dependent on someone else for affection or validation. This Kural, like many others, is a timeless piece of wisdom that applies to various situations in life, from personal relationships to professional scenarios..The kural verse:துறைவன் துறந்தமை தூற்றாகொல் முன்கைஇறைஇறவா நின்ற வளை. ,translates to :Will not my gliding bangles' cry The parting of my lord betray?,and it's explantion is :This verse of Thirukkural is a poignant depiction of the fear of separation in love. The lady in the verse notices the rings on her fingers sliding down, and she interprets this as a foreboding omen of her beloved's impending departure. \n\nThe verse subtly captures the heightened sensitivity that love brings. Every small event, every slight change is noticed, interpreted, and often related to the loved one. The sliding rings are not just ornaments but become symbols of the relationship. Their movement down the fingers is seen as a reflection of her lover's moving away from her.\n\nMoreover, this verse also conveys the cultural belief in omens and signs, prevalent in the Tamil society of the time. The lady believes that the physical world around her, in this case, her rings, can provide insights into her emotional world and her relationship.\n\nTo sum up, this Thirukkural verse beautifully articulates the fear of separation in love, the sensitivity towards minute changes when one is in love, and the belief in omens, all in the context of a simple yet powerful image of sliding rings..The kural verse:இன்னாது இனன்இல்ஊர் வாழ்தல் அதனினும்இன்னாது இனியார்ப் பிரிவு. ,translates to :Bitter is life in friendless place; Worse is parting love's embrace!,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse 1158 explores the theme of love and separation. The verse states that living in a town devoid of friends or familiar faces is painful. However, it asserts that this pain pales in comparison to the agony of being separated from a beloved person.\n\nThe verse highlights the human need for companionship and the emotional bond that ties us to our loved ones. It implicitly emphasizes the importance of maintaining strong relationships and the emotional distress caused by separation from those we hold dear. The poet, Thiruvalluvar, uses the comparison of living in an unfamiliar town to amplify the pain of separation, emphasizing that even the hardship of living among strangers is less daunting than parting from a loved one.\n\nIn essence, this verse reminds us of the value of meaningful relationships in our lives and the profound impact they have on our well-being. It encourages us to cherish these bonds and to strive to maintain them, recognizing the emotional turmoil that separation can cause. It is a timeless message that resonates with all, regardless of culture or era, underscoring the universal human experience of love and loss..The kural verse:தொடிற்சுடின் அல்லது காமநோய் போலவிடிற்சுடல் ஆற்றுமோ தீ. ,translates to :Can fire that burns by touch burn like Parting of the hearts love-sick?,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural highlights the intense nature of love and its profound impact, comparing it to the burn of fire. When you touch fire, it burns, but once you remove your touch, the burning sensation eases. However, love, likened here to a sickness, is not the same. The pain and longing associated with love can persist even in the absence of the loved one, much like a lingering illness. This is a unique aspect of love that differentiates it from physical sensations like the touch of fire.\n\nThe verse points out the deep emotional attachment and the inevitable pain in love, especially when separated from the loved one. It emphasizes the all-consuming nature of love that goes beyond physical presence and continues to affect the person even when the loved one is not physically present. Thus, the poet beautifully captures the persistent and pervasive nature of love, which is more enduring and impactful than the pain caused by a momentary touch of fire.\n\nThis verse is a reflection on the human experience of love and its profound impact on the psyche. The comparison to fire and illness underscores the intensity and the enduring nature of these feelings, offering a deep understanding of the emotional complexities involved in love and longing..The kural verse:அரிதாற்றி அல்லல்நோய் நீக்கிப் பிரிவாற்றிப்பின்இருந்து வாழ்வார் பலர். ,translates to :Many survive pangs of parting Not I this sore so distressing,and it's explantion is :Kural 1160 speaks about the resilience and strength of individuals, particularly in the context of love and separation. The verse suggests that there are many who can accept the seemingly impossible task of enduring a separation from their loved ones. They manage to eliminate the pain that accompanies such a separation and continue to live their lives thereafter.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the human capacity to adapt and survive in challenging circumstances, even when faced with deep emotional pain and distress. It highlights the potent human resilience and the ability to endure hardship and continue living. Also, this verse implies the strength and emotional resilience of women who often bear the brunt of separation.\n\nThis verse, in a broader sense, can be applied to any difficult situation in life where acceptance, endurance, and the will to move forward is required. It celebrates the strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity and the ability to overcome pain and hardship..The kural verse:மறைப்பேன்மன் யானிஃதோ நோயை இறைப்பவர்க்குஊற்றுநீர் போல மிகும். ,translates to :It swells out like baled out spring How to bear this pain so writhing?,and it's explantion is :The Thiru Kural verse 1161 is a poignant commentary on the experience of concealing one's emotional pain or distress, particularly in the context of romantic love. The verse portrays the paradoxical situation where the attempt to hide one's suffering only intensifies it, much like how a spring's water level rises when one tries to drain it.\n\nThe verse captures the human instinct to hide our pain, especially when it is related to love or heartbreak, to protect ourselves and others from the impact of our suffering. However, it also highlights the irony that this concealment often amplifies the pain we feel. \n\nThe analogy of the swelling spring used in the verse is significant. Just as how draining a spring can cause the water level to rise due to the water's natural tendency to seep back and fill the space, trying to suppress or hide one's emotional pain can cause it to grow, as emotions demand to be acknowledged and addressed.\n\nIn a broader perspective, this verse underscores the importance of open communication and emotional honesty. It suggests that hiding or suppressing our feelings can often lead to more harm than good, and that acknowledging our pain is a crucial step towards overcoming it. It's a reminder that it's okay to be vulnerable and seek help when we're hurting..The kural verse:கரத்தலும் ஆற்றேன்இந் நோயைநோய் செய்தார்க்குஉரைத்தலும் நாணுத் தரும். ,translates to :I can't conceal this nor complain For shame to him who caused this pain,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1162 speaks of the agony of unexpressed love and the dilemma it presents. The lover, in this verse, finds himself in an intense emotional predicament. He cannot hide the pain of his love, as it is too overwhelming and consuming. At the same time, he is unable to express his feelings to the person who has caused this pain, the beloved, as he feels a deep sense of shame and hesitation in doing so. \n\nThe verse beautifully encapsulates the struggle of silent love, where the lover battles the internal surge of powerful emotions and the external societal norms and personal inhibitions. It highlights the profound effect love can have on an individual, causing both immense joy and deep sorrow. The moral context here is the conflict between emotion and expression, a universal experience in love, irrespective of time and culture..The kural verse:காமமும் நாணும் உயிர்காவாத் தூங்கும்என்நோனா உடம்பின் அகத்து. ,translates to :In life -poles of this wearied frame Are poised the weights of lust and shame,and it's explantion is :This verse of Thiru Kural is a poignant expression of the poet's struggle with the conflicting forces of love and shame, using the metaphor of a shoulder pole or 'kaavadi'. The poet's body and soul are depicted as the pole, bearing the weight of these two emotions.\n\nIn traditional South Indian culture, a 'kaavadi' is a wooden pole carried on shoulders during religious processions, with loads balanced on either side. Here, the poet uses this imagery to represent his emotional turmoil. On one side of the pole is 'kaamam', the passionate love or desire he feels, which causes him suffering because it is unfulfilled or unexpressed. On the other side is 'naanam', the sense of shame or modesty, which prevents him from expressing his feelings openly and thus intensifies his pain.\n\nThe poet's body is described as being unable to bear this emotional burden, making his life unbearable. His soul, caught in the balance, is tormented by these opposing forces. This verse illustrates the intense internal conflict experienced by those in love, especially in a culture where expressing such emotions openly might be frowned upon.\n\nThis verse is a classic example of Thiru Kural's ability to convey profound emotional experiences in simple yet powerful metaphors, providing a deep insight into the human condition. The poet's skillful use of traditional cultural symbols makes this verse relatable to readers, regardless of their cultural background or historical context..The kural verse:காமக் கடல்மன்னும் உண்டே அதுநீந்தும்ஏமப் புணைமன்னும் இல். ,translates to :My lust is a sea; I do not see A raft to go across safely,and it's explantion is :Kural 1164 metaphorically describes the overwhelming nature of lust or deep romantic passion as an unbridled ocean. It communicates how intense and engulfing these feelings can be, much like a tumultuous sea that one can easily get lost in. However, it goes on to suggest that there isn't a reliable raft or safety vessel to navigate these stormy waters — a reference to the lack of control or safety mechanisms that one can use to steer or manage these powerful emotions.\n\nThis verse underscores the unpredictability and inherent risks associated with lust or romantic passion. It warns of the potential dangers and hardships, expressing the dire need for self-control, understanding, and wisdom to navigate these emotional tides safely. In a broader sense, it is an exhortation for individuals to exercise restraint and discretion in matters of the heart, to avoid being swept away by the flood of their emotions. \n\nThe verse is a classic example of Thirukkural's profound wisdom, offering timeless advice on managing one's emotions, particularly the strong, often overwhelming, feelings of love and lust. It encourages emotional intelligence and the importance of maintaining a sense of self amidst the tumult of intense emotions..The kural verse:துப்பின் எவனாவர் மன்கொல் துயர்வரவுநட்பினுள் ஆற்று பவர். ,translates to :What wilt they prove when they are foes Who in friendship bring me woes!,and it's explantion is :Kural 1165:\n\nThe verse essentially asks a rhetorical question about the nature of friends who bring grief even in amicable situations. It subtly points out that if a so-called friend can cause distress in peaceful circumstances, one can only imagine the extent of their harmful influence during times of conflict or adversity.\n\nThe Kural highlights an important aspect of human relationships, emphasizing the need for discernment in choosing our companions. It suggests that a true friend is not one who brings sorrow during times of peace, but someone who stands by us, offering support and comfort, especially during our most challenging times. \n\nThis verse calls for a careful and judicious evaluation of our friendships and relationships. It urges us to assess the value of a relationship not just based on happy times but more importantly, on how these relationships stand the test of adversity. The Kural promotes the idea that genuine friendships are those that are consistent and reliable, particularly in times of trouble..The kural verse:இன்பம் கடல்மற்றுக் காமம் அஃதடுங்கால்துன்பம் அதனிற் பெரிது. ,translates to :The pleasure in love is oceanful But its pangs are more painful,and it's explantion is :Kural 1166 is a profound observation on the dual nature of desire or lust. It compares the pleasure derived from fulfilling one's desires to the vastness of the sea, indicating that the joy can feel boundless and overwhelming. However, it also warns that the pain that comes from unfulfilled desires or separation from the object of one's desire is even greater than the pleasure, exceeding the enormity of the sea. \n\nThis verse is a cautionary note about the potential perils of unchecked passion. It reminds us that while the gratification derived from desire can be immense, the agony it can cause is even more profound, suggesting that one should be mindful of their desires and the potential consequences.\n\nThe verse also emphasizes the transient and unpredictable nature of desire. Just as the sea can be calm one moment and stormy the next, the pleasure derived from desire can quickly turn into pain. The verse, thus, encourages a balanced approach to desire, warning against becoming too attached or dependent on the pleasure it brings.\n\nIn a broader moral context, this verse can be interpreted as a commentary on the human tendency to seek immediate pleasure without considering the potential long-term pain. It underscores the importance of restraint and wisdom in managing our desires, suggesting that a balanced and thoughtful approach can help avoid future suffering..The kural verse:காமக் கடும்புனல் நீந்திக் கரைகாணேன்யாமத்தும் யானே உளேன். ,translates to :Wild waves of love I swim shoreless Pining alone in midnight hush,and it's explantion is :This verse is a poignant commentary on the overwhelming power of lust and desire, and how it can consume an individual's life to the extent that they feel perpetually alone, even amidst company. \n\nThe verse metaphorically describes lust as a 'terrible flood', signifying its uncontrollable and destructive nature. It suggests that the speaker has tried to overcome this flood, to 'swim across' it, but has failed to reach the 'shore' or find any resolution or relief. This speaks to the enduring and insatiable nature of lust, which can often leave an individual feeling lost, without a sense of direction or end.\n\nThe second part of the verse amplifies this feeling of loneliness and despair. Despite the passage of time ('even at midnight'), the speaker remains alone, wrestling with their desires. It reflects the internal struggle that one might go through, the constant battle within oneself. This feeling of isolation is not just physical - it is a psychological and emotional solitude, stemming from the inability to escape the clutches of unquenchable desire.\n\nThis verse serves as a reminder of the potential destructive power of unchecked desires. It is a calling for self-control and moderation in our pursuits of pleasure, and an acknowledgment of the need for balance in our lives..The kural verse:மன்னுயிர் எல்லாம் துயிற்றி அளித்திராஎன்னல்லது இல்லை துணை. ,translates to :Night's mercy lulls all souls to sleep Keeping but me for companionship,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural suggests the poet's experience of loneliness during the night, when all other creatures have been warmly embraced by sleep. The poet conveys the feeling of being singled out by the night, making him its sole companion while others rest. In essence, the verse explores the theme of solitude and isolation, particularly during the night - a time typically associated with rest and tranquility for all living beings. The poet's experience is a stark contrast to this norm, leading to a profound sense of loneliness.\n\nThe poet personifies the night as a compassionate entity that puts all living beings to sleep. However, he finds himself awake, alone, and without any companion. This could reflect his state of mind, possibly burdened by worries or thoughts that prevent him from finding the peace that others seem to effortlessly enjoy during the night. This verse is an eloquent illustration of the universal human experience of loneliness, beautifully cast in the backdrop of the silent and solitary night..The kural verse:கொடியார் கொடுமையின் தாம்கொடிய இந்நாள்நெடிய கழியும் இரா. ,translates to :Crueller than that cruel he Are midnight hours gliding slowly,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural talks about the intense pain of separation. It vividly portrays how the prolonged nights seem more cruel compared to the torment caused by the separation from the beloved.\n\nThe protagonist expresses their feelings of loneliness and sadness due to the absence of their loved one. The long, seemingly endless nights are portrayed as being torturous, even more so than the pain inflicted by the person who has left them. The 'cruelty' of the nights is a metaphor for the extreme sorrow and loneliness the person is experiencing in their lover's absence.\n\nThis verse emphasizes the depth of love and the agony of separation. It also subtly communicates the significance of time in intensifying the pain of longing and loneliness. In essence, it underscores the profound impact of love and separation on human emotions. \n\nThe cultural context here is the ancient Tamil society's deep appreciation for love and longing, which is a common theme in many traditional Tamil literary works..The kural verse:உள்ளம்போன்று உள்வழிச் செல்கிற்பின் வெள்ளநீர்நீந்தல மன்னோஎன் கண். ,translates to :Like heart, if my sight reaches him It won't in floods of tears swim!,and it's explantion is :The verse 1170 of Thiru Kural speaks about the profound longing and separation felt by a person from their loved one. It metaphorically uses the element of water (tears) to depict the depth of their sorrow and longing. \n\nIn this verse, the protagonist pleads that if their eyes could travel like their thoughts to the place where their beloved is, they would not be flooded with tears. This is an expression of intense love and separation, where the person's thoughts are always with their absent partner, making them feel their presence even when they are miles away. \n\nThe inability of the eyes to follow the path of the mind results in a deluge of tears, which is symbolic of the pain of separation. The verse beautifully captures the power of love that transcends physical distance, but at the same time, it also highlights the agony of not being able to be with the person one loves.\n\nThis verse is a classic example of Thiruvalluvar's ability to express profound emotions in a simple yet powerful way, making it relatable to anyone who has experienced love and longing..The kural verse:கண்தாம் கலுழ்வ தெவன்கொலோ தண்டாநோய்தாம்காட்ட யாம்கண் டது. ,translates to :The eye pointed him to me; why then They weep with malady and pine?,and it's explantion is :Kural 1171 reflects upon the paradoxical nature of love and the emotional turmoil it often brings. The speaker in this verse is experiencing the pain of love, which they describe as an \"incurable malady\". Interestingly, the speaker attributes this ailment to their own eyes, which first introduced them to the object of their affection. \n\nThe question raised in the second half of the verse brings forth the speaker's confusion and despair. They question why their eyes, which are the cause of their suffering, should now weep for the person they have shown. It's a poignant commentary on the irony of longing for someone who is the source of one's pain. \n\nThis verse captures the complexities of love - the initial attraction, the subsequent attachment, and the resultant suffering when the loved one is not around. It also underscores the unpredictable and often contradictory nature of human emotions, especially in the context of love and longing. \n\nIn a broader sense, this Kural can be seen as a reflection on the consequences of our choices and actions. Just as the eyes in the verse, we may sometimes find ourselves suffering from the very decisions we have made, questioning our own actions in retrospect.\n.The kural verse:தெரிந்துணரா நோக்கிய உண்கண் பரிந்துணராப்பைதல் உழப்பது எவன்? ,translates to :Why should these dyed eyes grieve now sans Regrets for their thoughtless glance?,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1172 is a profound verse about accountability and self-awareness in the context of love and relationships. It questions why someone should suffer sorrow due to the loss of a loved one when they themselves were the ones who fell in love without foresight or understanding of the consequences.\n\n\"Therinthunara nokkiya ungkan parinthunaraa paidal uzappathu evan?\" when translated to English, the verse questions, \"Why should the eyes that were smitten without understanding the consequences, now suffer in sorrow without comprehending their own fault?\"\n\nThis Kural is a critique of mindless passion and lack of foresight in love. It urges individuals to introspect and understand their own actions and decisions, especially when they lead to undesirable consequences. The verse suggests that those who rush into love without understanding the implications should also bear the sorrow that comes with it and learn from their experiences, instead of playing the victim. \n\nIn essence, it highlights the importance of understanding, foresight, and taking responsibility for one's own actions in love and relationships. It encourages introspection and self-awareness, reminding us that we are often the architects of our own joy and sorrow..The kural verse:கதுமெனத் தாநோக்கித் தாமே கலுழும்இதுநகத் தக்க துடைத்து. ,translates to :Eyes darted eager glance that day It's funny that they weep today,and it's explantion is :Thiru Kural 1173 describes the ironical nature of human emotions, particularly in the context of love. It observes how the same eyes that once eagerly sought a loved one's presence are now shedding tears due to his absence. This verse points out the paradox and the fickleness of human emotions; the same eyes that gleefully rejoiced in someone's presence are now drowning in sorrow because of their absence.\n\nThis Kural also subtly highlights the transient nature of human connections and relationships. It suggests that the emotional highs and lows we experience in relationships are a part of life's comedy and should be viewed with a sense of humor.\n\nIn a broader context, this verse can also be interpreted as a reflection on the human propensity to regret actions that were once performed with immense enthusiasm. It is a gentle reminder of the transient nature of our emotions, desires, and actions, and the inevitable changes and turns they may undergo over time. The poet, through this verse, encourages us to maintain a sense of humor and perspective in the face of such fluctuations and ironies of life. \n\nThe verse, in its essence, encapsulates the unpredictability of human emotions and the ironic situations they often lead us into, urging us to embrace the humor in our own inconsistencies..The kural verse:பெயலாற்றா நீருலந்த உண்கண் உயலாற்றாஉய்வில்நோய் என்கண் நிறுத்து. ,translates to :These eyes left me to endless grief Crying adry without relief,and it's explantion is :Kural 1174 delves into the poignant realm of unrequited love. The verse is a metaphorical lament of the protagonist about the unbearable pain of love that has been inflicted upon him by his own eyes. The 'painted eyes' here refer to his own eyes that are enamored by the object of his affection. \n\nThe 'lasting mortal disease' symbolizes the unending torment of unreciprocated love, which is so intense that it feels like a fatal ailment. This pain is so relentless and profound that it has drained him of his tears - 'the tears having dried up'. This signifies the extent of his suffering, that he has wept so much for his unrequited love, that he has no more tears left to shed.\n\nThe verse is a depiction of the extreme emotional turmoil experienced in the throes of one-sided love. The protagonist blames his own eyes for this plight, for it was they who first beheld and were captivated by the object of his love. But now, they are incapable of expressing his sorrow through tears, having exhausted their capacity to weep. \n\nIn essence, the verse captures the profound despair and intense emotional suffering often associated with unreciprocated love, and the inability to express this pain further, as even the tears have dried up..The kural verse:படலாற்றா பைதல் உழக்கும் கடலாற்றாக்காமநோய் செய்தஎன் கண். ,translates to :My eyes causing lust more than sea Suffer that torture sleeplessly,and it's explantion is :Kural 1175 portrays the agonizing power of unfulfilled love, conveyed through a poignant metaphor. The poet laments that his eyes, which were the agents of his passionate love (as intense as the boundless sea), are now suffering from sleeplessness due to the anguish of unrequited love.\n\nThe vastness of the sea is used as a metaphor to illustrate the depth and intensity of his romantic longing, which, according to the poet, was instigated by his own eyes. His eyes are personified as independent entities that played a role in instigating this profound love, and are now bearing the consequences of their actions.\n\nThe sleeplessness represents the mental turmoil and restlessness that he is experiencing as a result of his unreciprocated feelings. The poet suggests that just like the eyes were the cause of his deep love, they are now the victims of the torment that this love has brought upon him. \n\nThis verse, therefore, explores the paradoxical nature of love - it can be both the source of immense joy and profound sorrow depending upon whether it is reciprocated or not. It also highlights the interconnectedness of physical senses (in this case, sight) with emotional experiences..The kural verse:ஓஒ இனிதே எமக்கிந்நோய் செய்தகண்தாஅம் இதற்பட் டது. ,translates to :Lo! eyes that wrought this love-sickness Are victims of the same themselves,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1176 is a poignant verse that speaks of the joy derived from shared suffering in love. In this verse, the poet expresses a complex emotion - a sort of bitter-sweet satisfaction that his beloved, who is the reason for his suffering, is also experiencing the same agony.\n\nThe lover's eyes have given him the 'disease' - metaphorically referring to the deep love or passion that has consumed him. This love is so intense that it causes him pain. However, he notices that his beloved, the cause of his affliction, is also suffering the same anguish. This shared suffering brings him a strange sense of delight.\n\nThe verse beautifully encapsulates the paradoxical nature of love - it can cause pain and pleasure at the same time. In love, even the pain becomes bearable, and even enjoyable, when shared mutually. It is this shared suffering in love that the poet finds delightful. \n\nTherefore, this verse is a profound reflection on the complex and often contradictory emotions that love can provoke. It highlights the depth of the poet's love, his empathy for his beloved, and his ability to find joy even in the shared suffering. It is a testament to the transformative power of love that can turn even pain into pleasure..The kural verse:உழந்துழந் துள்நீர் அறுக விழைந்திழைந்துவேண்டி அவர்க்கண்ட கண். ,translates to :Let tears dry up pining pining In eyes that eyed him longing longing,and it's explantion is :Kural 1177 is a deeply emotional verse that expresses the anguish of unrequited love and the pain of separation. The eyes that once tenderly gazed upon the beloved with intense longing and desire are now condemned to a state of ceaseless sorrow and longing, to the point where they exhaust the wellspring of their tears.\n\nThe verse uses the metaphor of the eyes to symbolize the heart that loves and yearns, and the drying up of tears to represent the unending pain and suffering that comes with unfulfilled love and longing. It is a heart-wrenching plea for the eyes (or the heart) to endure the torment of separation, to suffer until they can no longer weep.\n\nThe cultural context is the traditional Tamil concept of love and longing, where the eyes are often seen as mirrors of the soul and the heart, reflecting deep emotions and feelings. The verse also reflects the ancient Tamil tradition of expressing intense emotions and experiences through powerful and evocative imagery.\n\nIn a broader moral context, the verse may be interpreted to mean that intense longing and attachment, whether in love or in other aspects of life, can lead to profound suffering and pain. It serves as a poignant reminder of the transient nature of worldly desires and the anguish that often accompanies their non-fulfillment. It may also be seen as an admonition to exercise restraint in our desires and attachments, to avoid such pain and suffering..The kural verse:பேணாது பெட்டார் உளர்மன்னோ மற்றவர்க்காணாது அமைவில கண். ,translates to :Ther's he whose lips loved, not his heart Yet my eyes pine seeing him not,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural talks about the paradox of love and affection. The character in the verse is yearning for someone who verbally expressed love for them but lacked genuine emotional warmth and sincerity in their heart. Despite the insincere love, the person desperately longs to see the other, indicating an unfulfilled desire and deep emotional bond.\n\nThe verse sheds light on the subjectivity of human emotions and how we often crave the presence of those who may not genuinely reciprocate our feelings. It illustrates the complexities of love, where the lack of authenticity does not necessarily diminish the longing or the attachment one feels towards the other person. \n\nThe verse also underscores the intense emotional turmoil and pain experienced by the person who cannot see their loved one. It beautifully captures the emotional struggle and yearning for someone who may not truly love them back, highlighting the poignant and heartbreaking side of love. \n\nIn a broader sense, the verse encourages us to reflect on our relationships and the sincerity of our feelings towards others. It reminds us of the importance of genuine love and emotional honesty in nurturing and maintaining healthy relationships..The kural verse:வாராக்கால் துஞ்சா வரின்துஞ்சா ஆயிடைஆரஞர் உற்றன கண். ,translates to :He comes; no sleep; he goes; no sleep This is the fate of eyes that weep,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural speaks about the intensity of love and longing. The beloved's absence and presence both bring a certain kind of restlessness that prevents sleep. The verse uses sleep as a metaphor to express the state of peace and tranquility, which is disturbed in both cases.\n\nWhen the beloved is away, the eyes stay awake, yearning for their return. The uncertainty, the longing, and the anticipation of their return keeps the lover awake. This demonstrates the deep attachment and the emotional dependence the lover has on the beloved.\n\nOn the other hand, when the beloved is present, the fear of their imminent departure keeps the lover awake. The joy of being in their presence is overshadowed by the dread of separation. It signifies that the lover wants to cherish every moment with the beloved, fearing it might be the last. \n\nThus, the verse showcases the bitter-sweet pain of love where the lover endures unbearable agony in both the beloved's absence and presence. The eyes, used here as a symbol for the lover's heart and mind, are in a constant state of unrest, reflecting the profound impact of love..The kural verse:மறைபெறல் ஊரார்க்கு அரிதன்றால் எம்போல்அறைபறை கண்ணார் அகத்து. ,translates to :Like drum beats eyes declare my heart; From people who could hide his secret?,and it's explantion is :Kural 1180 explores the theme of love and the difficulty of concealing one's emotions, especially in a close-knit community. \n\nIn this verse, Valluvar likens the eyes of a person in love to beaten drums, suggesting the difficulty in hiding the turmoil within. Just as the sound of a beaten drum cannot be subdued, the eyes of a person in love reveal the inner emotions clearly, making it hard to keep it a secret. \n\nEssentially, the poet is expressing the sentiment that those in love, like him, cannot easily hide their feelings, especially from the people in their immediate community. The people in a place, due to their close interactions and familiarity with each other, can easily perceive the subtle changes and cues that indicate a person is in love. \n\nSo, the verse talks about the transparency of human emotions, especially love, and the challenge of disguising them in a community that is accustomed to reading those signs. The verse is a testament to the keen observational skills of the people and the difficulty in masking intense emotions such as love..The kural verse:நயந்தவர்க்கு நல்காமை நேர்ந்தேன் பசந்தவென்பண்பியார்க்கு உரைக்கோ பிற. ,translates to :My lover's parting, I allowed Whom to complain my hue pallid?,and it's explantion is :Kural 1181 laments the profound sorrow and loneliness experienced after parting from a loved one. The speaker, presumably a woman, gave her consent for her beloved to leave, possibly for a journey or mission. However, after he left, she was engulfed in deep melancholy, turning pale and sallow due to her sadness. \n\nShe questions, \"To whom can I now convey the extent of my despair and the physical toll it has taken on me?\" This suggests a sense of isolation and despair, as there is no one who can truly understand or empathize with her pain. It also indicates her regret for allowing the departure of her loved one.\n\nThis verse underscores the intensity of love and the profound impact it can have on a person's physical and emotional well-being. It suggests that separation from a loved one - even when consensual - can lead to deep sorrow and loneliness. It also conveys the idea that such profound emotions are often difficult to communicate to those who haven't experienced them..The kural verse:அவர்தந்தார் என்னும் தகையால் இவர்தந்தென்மேனிமேல் ஊரும் பசப்பு. ,translates to :Claiming it is begot through him Pallor creeps and rides over my frame,and it's explantion is :The verse 1182 from the Thiru Kural explains the speaker's emotional state caused by the absence of their beloved. The speaker describes a deep melancholy, represented by 'sallowness' or 'pallor' that has taken over their physical appearance. This pallor is personified as riding on their body, spreading and prevailing everywhere.\n\nHowever, this pallor is not merely a sign of physical suffering or illness; it is also a symbol of the speaker's intense love and longing for their beloved. The speaker expresses a certain pride in their sallowness, stating that it has been caused by their lover's absence. This pride in their suffering suggests that the speaker cherishes their love and the emotions associated with it, including the pain of separation.\n\nThus, this verse is a poignant expression of the bittersweet nature of love, where even pain and suffering are treasured as symbols of the depth and intensity of one's feelings.\n\nIn a broader context, this verse underlines the power of emotions, how they can manifest physically and affect one's appearance, and how they can become a source of pride and identity. It reminds us that our feelings, however painful, are a significant part of who we are, shaping our experiences and our identities..The kural verse:சாயலும் நாணும் அவர்கொண்டார் கைம்மாறாநோயும் பசலையும் தந்து. ,translates to :He seized my beauty and modesty Leaving pangs and Pallor to me,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural speaks about the agony of unrequited love. The poet laments the loss of her beauty and modesty due to the overwhelming pain of unreciprocated affection. She personifies her lover as the one who took away her charm and grace, and in return, bestowed her with the ailment of love and a sallow complexion.\n\nThe verse uses vivid imagery to portray the physical and emotional toll that such a love brings. The disease refers to the profound emotional pain and longing she experiences, while the sallowness symbolises the physical deterioration, perhaps due to lack of care for oneself in the wake of such pain.\n\nThe poet is essentially voicing a lament of love that is unreturned, detailing the resulting emotional and physical distress. It is a poignant reminder of how love, when not reciprocated, can lead to a deep sense of loss and suffering. The verse encapsulates the profound impact love can have on one's overall well-being..The kural verse:உள்ளுவன் மன்யான் உரைப்பது அவர்திறமால்கள்ளம் பிறவோ பசப்பு. ,translates to :He is my thought, his praise my theme Yet this pallor steals over my frame,and it's explantion is :The verse 1184 can be understood as an exploration of the subtleties of love and affection. Here, the poet expresses a sense of confusion and frustration over the deceptive nature of love. \n\nThe protagonist in this verse is deeply in love, and they spend their time thinking and speaking about their beloved, focusing particularly on their positive attributes and virtues. However, despite this deep affection and admiration, they note a certain 'sallowness' or distress, which seems to come out of nowhere. This feeling of distress is described as 'deceitful', indicating a sense of betrayal or unexpectedness. \n\nIn essence, the poet is articulating the paradox of love. On one hand, love brings joy, admiration, and deep affection. On the other hand, it also brings unexpected distress and pain. The appearance of this distress, despite the protagonist's deep affection and admiration for their beloved, is seen as 'deceitful'. Thus, the verse poignantly captures the quintessential bitter-sweet nature of love. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can also be interpreted as a commentary on human emotions and feelings. It underscores the complexity and unpredictability of our emotions, suggesting that feelings of pain and distress can sometimes emerge even in situations that are seemingly filled with joy and happiness..The kural verse:உவக்காண்எம் காதலர் செல்வார் இவக்காண்என்மேனி பசப்பூர் வது. ,translates to :My lover departed me there And pallor usurped my body here,and it's explantion is :This Kural is a poignant expression of the pain of separation in love. The poetess, presumably Avvaiyar, is depicting her own emotional state after her lover's departure. She uses the metaphor of her skin turning sallow, a physical manifestation of her emotional distress, to depict the depth of her sorrow.\n\nThe verse begins with a reference to her lover's departure. The fact that he is still considered a 'lover' implies that their relationship was one of deep affection and mutual respect, making his departure all the more painful.\n\nThe second part of the verse describes the effect this separation has had on her. She notes that her skin has turned sallow or pale, a common symptom of emotional stress or depression. The use of this physical symptom serves to underscore the depth of her emotional pain, showing that it is not just a mental or emotional state, but something that affects her physically as well.\n\nThe underlying message is the profound impact of love and separation on our lives. Love can imbue our lives with joy and meaning, but its absence can also bring about deep sorrow and physical distress. This verse is a reminder that love and pain often go hand in hand, and that the depth of our love can often be measured by the depth of our sorrow in its absence..The kural verse:விளக்கற்றம் பார்க்கும் இருளேபோல் கொண்கன்முயக்கற்றம் பார்க்கும் பசப்பு. ,translates to :Just as darkness waits for light-off Pallor looks for lover's arms-off,and it's explantion is :Kural 1186 is a metaphorical verse that uses imagery to convey the deep emotional state of a woman longing for her beloved. \n\nIn the first half of the verse, \"Just as darkness waits for the failing light\", Valluvar uses the imagery of darkness awaiting the fading of light. Here, darkness is personified as a patient entity, waiting for the opportune moment to spread itself. This is a universal phenomenon, where the darkness of night inevitably follows the fading light of day.\n\nThe second half of the verse, \"so does sallowness wait for the laxity of my husband's intercourse\", speaks of the woman's longing for her husband's affection and touch. The 'sallowness' refers to the pallor or lack of color that comes over her due to her yearning and longing. This pallor, similar to the darkness, waits for the laxity, or lack of intimacy, from her husband. \n\nThis verse beautifully captures the longing of a woman for her beloved, where her emotional state is compared to the deepening of darkness with the fading light. It shows how physical separation can affect one's emotional and physical state, creating a sense of longing and yearning. \n\nThe moral interpretation of the verse lies in its expression of profound love and longing, showing how deeply one can be affected by the absence of their loved one. It serves as a reminder of the deep bonds of affection that exist between couples, and the emotional and physical changes that can occur due to separation..The kural verse:புல்லிக் கிடந்தேன் புடைபெயர்ந்தேன் அவ்வளவில்அள்ளிக்கொள் வற்றே பசப்பு. ,translates to :From his embrace I turned a nonce This pallor swallowed me at once,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1187 is a poignant expression of the poet's deep longing and sorrow from separation. Here, Valluvar portrays the intensity of the lover's pain when distanced from their beloved, even momentarily. \n\nThe verse says, \"I was once in a close embrace with my beloved; but I just turned aside for a moment; that much time was enough for me to be seized by sallowness (pallor of face caused by longing)\". \n\nThis verse is rich in emotional content and uses the imagery of physical pallor to describe the emotional effect of separation. The poet conveys that the longing for the beloved is so profound that even a brief moment of separation can cause visible changes in the lover's demeanor, akin to physical illness. \n\nThe verse also underlines the depth of the bond between lovers and the immense emotional toll taken by separation, however brief. It shares the universal human experience of longing and the discomfort caused by the absence of a loved one, suggesting that love can profoundly affect our physical and emotional states.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse could be interpreted to mean that true love is marked by a deep interconnectedness where the absence of the loved one can cause a physical and emotional upheaval. It emphasizes that love is not merely a feeling but a powerful force that can significantly influence our well-being..The kural verse:பசந்தாள் இவள்என்பது அல்லால் இவளைத்துறந்தார் அவர்என்பார் இல். ,translates to :On my pallor they cast a slur But none says \\\"lo he parted her\\\",and it's explantion is :This Kural is a reverberation of the societal mindset and judgement towards women in a relationship, especially when it ends. The verse speaks about a woman who has lost her lover and is grieving. The society, instead of acknowledging the man's desertion, focuses on the woman's deteriorated health and her pallor due to her heartbreak. \n\nThe verse highlights the lack of empathy and understanding in society regarding the emotional turmoil the woman is going through. It criticizes the societal norms that blame or judge the woman for her situation instead of recognizing the man's decision to abandon her. The verse is a poignant depiction of how society often overlooks the pain and suffering of a woman in favor of maintaining an outward appearance of propriety or harmony.\n\nIn essence, this Kural calls for a shift in perspective, urging society to be more understanding and empathetic towards the emotional pain and suffering of individuals, particularly women, in such situations. It asks society to refrain from judging or blaming them but to recognize and acknowledge the circumstances that led to their current state..The kural verse:பசக்கமன் பட்டாங்கென் மேனி நயப்பித்தார்நன்னிலையர் ஆவர் எனின். ,translates to :Let all my body become pale If he who took my leave fares well,and it's explantion is :This Kural belongs to the section of Thiru Kural that deals with love and the various emotional states it leads to. Here, it refers to the feelings of a person left behind by their beloved. \n\nThe verse essentially says, \"If the person who left me, having earned my consent, is in good state, then let my body bear the pain and become pale.\" \n\nThe poet Valluvar here talks about the selfless love one has towards their beloved. It suggests that even after parting ways, the lover wishes well for their beloved and is ready to bear any physical pain or change (here indicated by the body turning sallow or pale, often associated with sadness or illness), as long as their beloved is in a good state. \n\nThis verse highlights the depth of true love, which is selfless and enduring, even in the face of separation. It is a poignant reminder of the sacrifices one is willing to make for the well-being of the person they love..The kural verse:பசப்பெனப் பேர்பெறுதல் நன்றே நயப்பித்தார்நல்காமை தூற்றார் எனின். ,translates to :Let people call me all pallid But my lover let them not deride,and it's explantion is :Kural 1190 explores the profound emotional experience of love and separation. It states that it is preferable to be known as someone who has turned pale due to the pain of separation, rather than someone who has been disloyal or unkind to their beloved.\n\nThe verse suggests that it is better to be seen as a person suffering from the melancholy of parting from a loved one, rather than be known as someone who has caused pain or distress to their partner. The 'pallor' or 'sallowness' mentioned in the verse is a metaphor for the emotional distress and sadness caused by the separation from the beloved.\n\nThe Kural also emphasizes the importance of maintaining one's integrity and kindness even in times of emotional distress. It suggests that it is better to endure personal pain than to cause harm to others, especially to someone who was once dear.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse underscores the moral value of loyalty, kindness, and the willingness to endure personal suffering rather than inflict pain on others. It reinforces the idea that true love is characterized by selflessness, patience, and the ability to bear personal suffering without causing harm to the loved one. \n\nThus, the verse embodies the ethos of emotional resilience, loyalty, and empathy, which are fundamental to the ethical and moral fabric of human relationships..The kural verse:தாம்வீழ்வார் தம்வீழப் பெற்றவர் பெற்றாரேகாமத்துக் காழில் கனி. ,translates to :Stoneless fruit of love they have Who are beloved by those they love,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse metaphorically talks about the joy of reciprocal love in a relationship. In the comparison used, the \"stone-less fruit\" signifies the pleasure and satisfaction that comes from a mutual love where both parties love and are loved equally by each other. The verse accentuates that the women who are loved by the men they love are fortunate as they have obtained this stone-less fruit of sexual delight, symbolizing a relationship that is free of obstacles or discomforts.\n\nThe underlying philosophy is about the essence of reciprocity in love and how mutual affection enhances the joy of love. It emphasizes that in a relationship, the love should be reciprocated to experience the ultimate happiness and satisfaction, just as one enjoys a sweet, stone-less fruit without any hindrance. \n\nIn the cultural context, this verse also reflects the ancient Tamil society's understanding and appreciation of a woman's emotions and desires in love, acknowledging her right to expect and enjoy reciprocal love..The kural verse:வாழ்வார்க்கு வானம் பயந்தற்றால் வீழ்வார்க்குவீழ்வார் அள஧ க்கும் அளி. ,translates to :The lover-and-beloved's self-givings Are like rains to living beings,and it's explantion is :The couplet, Kural 1192, beautifully delineates the profound essence of love and its significant role in our lives. It draws an analogy between the timely rainfall and the reciprocation of affection by loved ones.\n\nJust as rain, falling at the right time, sustains life on earth, the exchange of love between two individuals at the opportune moment fosters and nourishes their relationship. The verse emphasizes the importance of timing and reciprocation in love. Just as rain is essential for the survival and prosperity of life on earth, the same is the case with love in human relationships. If the rain fails, life struggles; similarly, if love is not reciprocated, relationships wither.\n\nLike the rain that doesn't discriminate and falls on all, true love is also unbiased and should be shared unconditionally. The verse thus imparts a profound lesson on love, urging us to express and share it generously, and at the right moment. This is because, in both cases - whether it's rain for the earth or love for humans - their timely and generous bestowal is what allows life and relationships to thrive. \n\nThe cultural context of this verse is deeply rooted in Tamil society, where both love and rain are celebrated as life-sustaining forces. The verse calls for acknowledging and reciprocating the love we receive, as it's as vital to our emotional and social wellbeing as rain is to the physical life on earth..The kural verse:வீழுநர் வீழப் படுவார்க்கு அமையுமேவாழுநம் என்னும் செருக்கு. ,translates to :The pride of living is for those Whose love is returned by love so close,and it's explantion is :The verse 1193 from Thiru Kural talks about the strength, resolve and confidence that love bestows upon individuals who are cherished by their partners. It emphasizes that the assertion \"we shall live\" is most suitable for those who are deeply loved and valued by their partners or spouses.\n\nThis verse highlights the resilience and optimism that love can bring. Even when faced with challenges or hardships, the beloved ones maintain their hope and determination to live because they are cherished by their partners. The sense of significance and self-worth derived from this love gives them the courage and conviction to face life with positivity.\n\nThe Tamil explanations provided various perspectives to this verse. The first Tamil explanation by mk emphasizes the joy and fulfillment that one receives from being loved by their partner. The second Tamil explanation by mv points out that this confidence to live and face life's challenges is suitable even for those who, despite experiencing separation distress, are still loved by their partners. The third Tamil explanation by sp highlights that this confidence and resolve to live is appropriate for a woman who is loved and cherished by her husband, stemming from her firm belief that he will return to her.\n\nIn essence, this verse underscores the profound strength and resilience that love can instill in individuals, empowering them to live their lives with optimism and determination..The kural verse:வீழப் படுவார் கெழீஇயிலர் தாம்வீழ்வார்வீழப் படாஅர் எனின். ,translates to :Whose love is void of love in turn Are luckless with all esteems they earn,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse 1194 focuses on the essence of mutual love and respect in a relationship. It essentially states that even if a person is admired and esteemed by others, if they are not loved by their own beloved, their worth diminishes in their eyes. The value and worth of a person are not solely determined by the admiration they receive from the world, but rather, it is substantially based on the love and affection they receive from their partner. The verse emphasizes that true excellence lies in being loved by the one you love. In the absence of this reciprocal emotion, any external admiration or esteem becomes irrelevant. Therefore, this verse is a subtle reminder of the importance of mutual love and respect in maintaining the integrity of a relationship..The kural verse:நாம்காதல் கொண்டார் நமக்கெவன் செய்பவோதாம்காதல் கொள்ளாக் கடை. ,translates to :What can our lover do us now If he does not requite our love?,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse, Kural 1195, explores the dynamics of unrequited love. It essentially questions the value and joy derived from loving someone who does not reciprocate the same feelings. \n\nThe verse states, \"He who is beloved by me, what will he do to me, if I am not beloved by him?\" This phrase is an introspective question that the poet poses, questioning the ramifications of one-sided love. It reflects on the emotional turmoil and lack of fulfillment that comes when the love one extends is not reciprocated.\n\nThe verse suggests that the happiness derived from a relationship is contingent upon mutual affection. If the person one loves does not hold the same affection, it casts doubt on the joy and benefits that could be gained from such a relationship. This verse serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of reciprocity in love, urging individuals to reflect on their relationships and the nature of the affection they hold for others. \n\nIn a broader sense, the verse also encourages self-respect and self-love. It implies that one should not settle for less in relationships and should seek out mutual love and respect..The kural verse:ஒருதலையான் இன்னாது காமம்காப் போலஇருதலை யானும் இனிது. ,translates to :One sided pains; love in both souls Poises well like shoulder poles,and it's explantion is :Kural 1196 speaks about the nature of love and how it should be balanced between two individuals for it to be harmonious and fulfilling. It uses the metaphor of a 'Kavadi', a traditional physical burden used in Hindu religious practices, typically balanced on both sides of the bearer's shoulder.\n\nIn the verse, Thiruvalluvar likens one-sided love to carrying a Kavadi that is only heavy on one side. It's burdensome, painful, and unsettling. It throws the person off balance, both physically and emotionally. Just as a Kavadi is meant to be balanced, with equal weight on each side, love too should be balanced. It should be a shared feeling, equally strong and committed on both sides. \n\nWhen love is mutual and balanced like the Kavadi, it brings joy, satisfaction, and harmony. It is a beautiful experience that pleases both individuals involved. This Kural advises that love should be reciprocated and mutual for it to be beneficial and enjoyable, rather than causing pain and discomfort when it's one-sided. \n\nThis Kural is a timeless reminder of the importance of balance and equality in relationships, it teaches us that love should be a shared experience that brings joy not pain. It warns against the hurt and imbalance that comes from unrequited love..The kural verse:பருவரலும் பைதலும் காணான்கொல் காமன்ஒருவர்கண் நின்றொழுகு வான். ,translates to :This cupid aims at me alone; Knows he not my pallor and pain?,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural speaks about the one-sided nature of love and the suffering it causes. Here, Valluvar personifies 'Cupid', the god of love, as being present and active only in one party, rather than in both involved in love.\n\nThe poet is expressing his lament that Cupid, who resides and acts only in one person, might not understand or witness the pain and sorrow experienced by that person. When love is not reciprocated by the other party, the person who is in love experiences great anguish and heartache. \n\nThe poet further elaborates that the pain includes both emotional suffering and physical effects, as indicated by the reference to changes in complexion due to the emotional turmoil. \n\nThis verse is a poignant commentary on unrequited love and the intense grief it can cause. It serves as a reminder that love, to bring joy, needs to be mutual and reciprocal..The kural verse:வீழ்வாரின் இன்சொல் பெறாஅது உலகத்துவாழ்வாரின் வன்கணார் இல். ,translates to :None is so firm as she who loves Without kind words from whom she dotes,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 1198, explores the depth of love and the pain of separation. It suggests that there are none as stoic or hard-hearted as those who can continue to live without receiving even a single kind word from the ones they love. This could be due to a separation, a misunderstanding, or any circumstance that prevents them from being in touch with their beloved.\n\nThe verse uses the metaphor of hardness of rock to describe the strength of those who endure such a situation. It implies that they withstand an immense amount of emotional pain, akin to how a rock withstands harsh weather conditions. \n\nAt the same time, the verse also subtly criticizes these individuals, suggesting that it's unnatural to be so unaffected by the absence of affection. It hints at the necessity of love and affection in human life, and how its absence can make one's existence cold and hard like a rock.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse highlights the importance of communication, especially kind and affectionate words, in maintaining a strong bond between individuals. It emphasizes that withholding affectionate words can cause as much pain as physical separation. \n\nThus, the verse encourages us to express our love and affection freely, and to not withhold kind words, as they have the power to provide solace and strength, especially during times of emotional distress..The kural verse:நசைஇயார் நல்கார் எனினும் அவர்மாட்டுஇசையும் இனிய செவிக்கு. ,translates to :The lover accords not my desires And yet his words sweeten my ears,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 1199, explores the profound nature of love and the deep emotional bond that can exist between two individuals. The verse essentially communicates that even if the beloved shows no reciprocation of love, their words or even the mention of their name still brings joy and sweetness to the listener's ears. \n\nThe love being spoken about here is so deep and unconditional that it doesn't require reciprocation to sustain itself. The lover finds pleasure and happiness simply from the beloved’s words, showing the depth of their affection. This verse highlights the selfless nature of true love, where one's happiness can be derived simply from the existence or thought of the other, regardless of their actions or responses.\n\nThis Kural demonstrates the timeless wisdom of Thiruvalluvar, as it reveals an aspect of human emotion and love that is universally relatable. It teaches us the virtues of unconditional love and selfless affection, showing that true love does not demand anything in return..The kural verse:உறாஅர்க்கு உறுநோய் உரைப்பாய் கடலைச்செறாஅஅய் வாழிய நெஞ்சு. ,translates to :You tell your grief to listless he Bless my heart! rather fill up sea!,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 1200, essentially advises the reader's heart or soul to persevere and find solutions to its problems, rather than sharing its woes with those who lack empathy or understanding.\n\nThe poet uses the metaphor of a vast sea to symbolize the heart's sorrow. He suggests that it would be easier to drain this sea, i.e., to tackle your problems directly, rather than seeking solace in those who might not care or understand. This implies the importance of self-reliance and resilience in the face of hardship.\n\nThe verse also conveys the futility of sharing your deepest sorrows with those who lack empathy. Just as it is impossible to drain the sea, it is equally futile to expect understanding or help from those incapable of empathy. It encourages the heart to remain strong, to live, and face its sorrows head-on.\n\nIn essence, this Thiru Kural verse teaches the virtues of resilience, self-reliance, and the importance of choosing the right people to confide in. It advises against pointless lamentation and encourages proactive problem-solving..The kural verse:உள்ளினும் தீராப் பெருமகிழ் செய்தலால்கள்ளினும் காமம் இனிது. ,translates to :Love is sweeter than wine; for vast Is its delight at very thought,and it's explantion is :Kural 1201 explores the theme of love and desire, drawing a comparison with the transient pleasure offered by liquor. The verse emphasizes that the joy derived from love and passion is sweeter and more enduring than that obtained from consuming liquor. \n\nThe verse suggests that while liquor only provides a fleeting sense of pleasure when consumed, the joy derived from love remains with us even when we merely think about it. It leaves an indelible imprint on our heart and mind, creating a sense of rapture and delight that lingers long after the moment has passed. This enduring joy is what makes love and desire \"sweeter\" than liquor.\n\nThis kural highlights the transformative power of love, and how it can create a sense of happiness that transcends the temporal and physical constraints of life. It also underscores the notion that love, in its purest form, is a source of deep and lasting pleasure, surpassing those derived from other worldly indulgences. \n\nIn a broader sense, the verse can be interpreted as a reflection on the nature of true joy. It suggests that the most profound and lasting form of happiness comes from meaningful emotional connections and experiences, rather than temporary physical pleasures. It is a reminder to appreciate and cherish the deep emotional bonds and relationships in our lives, as they offer a source of joy that is both enduring and fulfilling..The kural verse:எனைத்தொனறு இனிதேகாண் காமம்தாம் வீழ்வார்நினைப்ப வருவதொன்று ஏல். ,translates to :Pains are off at the lover's thought In all aspects this love is sweet,and it's explantion is :Kural 1202 explains the nature of love and the joy it brings, regardless of the circumstances. It suggests that the thought of the beloved itself brings delight, and there is no distress caused by separation. This is due to the inherent sweetness of love, which remains pleasurable in all its forms.\n\nIn essence, the verse highlights the power and depth of love. Even when lovers are apart, the mere thought or memory of the beloved can evoke a sense of joy and happiness. This is a testament to the profound delight that love can provide, making even the pain of separation bearable. The verse emphasizes that love, in any degree or form, is capable of delivering pleasure and alleviating pain. \n\nThus, the Kural teaches us about the strength and beauty of love, and its capacity to bring joy and comfort, regardless of the circumstances. It also underlines the importance of cherishing love and the happiness it can bring into our lives. \n\nThis verse is particularly relevant in today's world, where physical distance often separates loved ones. Despite this, the joy derived from love can overcome the sorrow of separation, reinforcing the timeless nature of Thiruvalluvar's wisdom..The kural verse:நினைப்பவர் போன்று நினையார்கொல் தும்மல்சினைப்பது போன்று கெடும். ,translates to :To sneeze I tried hence but could not Me he tried to think but did not,and it's explantion is :This Kural uses a metaphor to express the poet's anticipation and subsequent disappointment. The sensation of an impending sneeze that never comes is compared to the expectation that his beloved will think of him, which also never happens. \n\nThe sneeze metaphor is relevant because it's a natural reflex that is almost uncontrollable, and the sensation that precedes it creates a sense of anticipation. Similarly, the poet is waiting for his beloved to think of him, a thought he believes is as natural and inevitable as a sneeze. \n\nHowever, just as a sneeze that doesn't come leaves one feeling unfulfilled and uncomfortable, the poet feels a similar disappointment when his beloved doesn't think of him as he anticipated. The moment of pause, the build-up of expectation, and the subsequent let-down are beautifully captured in this verse.\n\nThe verse underscores the agony of unreciprocated love and the longing one feels in the absence of their beloved. It's a poignant reminder of the vulnerability and the emotional roller-coaster that love often brings with it..The kural verse:யாமும் உளேங்கொல் அவர்நெஞ்சத்து எந்நெஞ்சத்துஓஒ உளரே அவர். ,translates to :Have I a place within his heart? Ah from mine he will never depart,and it's explantion is :This Kural (verse 1204) is an exploration of the concept of reciprocal love in a poetic and reflective style. It deals with the deep emotional attachment one feels towards their lover, and the longing for the same intensity of affection to be returned. \n\nThe verse is a question posed by the poet, expressing a doubt or uncertainty about whether their lover harbors the same depth of feelings. The poet's lover resides constantly in their heart, an embodiment of their deep, unwavering affection. This love is so profound that it feels as if the lover has taken up permanent residence within their heart. \n\nHowever, the poet wonders if they hold the same place in their lover's heart. They question whether their presence is as constant and enduring in their lover's heart as their lover's is in theirs. \n\nThe beauty of this verse lies not just in its expression of deep love, but also in its portrayal of the vulnerability that comes with such emotions. It shows that love is not just about the joy of being in love, but also about the fear of not being loved back with the same intensity. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can also be applied to any kind of relationship - be it friendship, familial ties, or even spiritual devotion. It underscores the universal desire for reciprocation in any form of affection or attachment..The kural verse:தம்நெஞ்சத்து எம்மைக் கடிகொண்டார் நாணார்கொல்எம்நெஞ்சத்து ஓவா வரல். ,translates to :Shame! My heart often he enters Banning me entry into his,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1205 can be explained as follows:\n\nThis verse is a subtle expression of romantic love, conveying the longing and the emotional interplay between two hearts that are deeply in love. The poetess wonders why her lover, who has captivated her heart, or in her words, \"imprisoned her in his soul,\" should feel any reluctance or shame in allowing her the same privilege. \n\nIn essence, she questions why her loved one, who has claimed such a significant place in her heart, should shy away from allowing her to inhabit his heart in an equally deep and unending manner. The verse captures the depth of her affection and the yearning for an equal reciprocation of her feelings. \n\nThe cultural context is important here: Tamil society, during the Sangam period, was known for its deep-rooted tradition of courting and romantic love. The verse reflects this tradition, where lovers often expressed their feelings in metaphorical and poetic terms. \n\nFrom a moral perspective, this Kural can be interpreted as a call for openness and mutual trust in a relationship. The poetess, through her question, underscores the importance of mutual understanding and emotional sharing in sustaining love..The kural verse:மற்றியான் என்னுளேன் மன்னோ அவரொடியான்உற்றநாள் உள்ள உளேன். ,translates to :Beyond the thought of life with him What else of life can I presume?,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural essentially talks about the depth of love and the longing for a beloved. The poet uses a rhetorical question to convey the intensity of his feelings. \n\nThe speaker says he survives by constantly reminiscing about the times he spent with his beloved. This indicates that his life is so intertwined with his beloved that even their past moments together have become his lifeline. The memories of their shared experiences and interactions are what keep him going and provide him comfort in their absence.\n\nHe further asks, 'If not for these memories, how else could I live?' This question underscores the fact that his existence is so deeply connected with his beloved that without them, life would be unbearable. The memories of their love are not just a part of his life, but his very reason for living. \n\nIn essence, this verse beautifully captures the profound emotional attachment and longing that one feels for their loved one, and how such feelings can become a sustaining force in their life..The kural verse:மறப்பின் எவனாவன் மற்கொல் மறப்பறியேன்உள்ளினும் உள்ளம் சுடும். ,translates to :What will happen if I forget When his memory burns my heart?,and it's explantion is :Kural 1207 explores the depth of love and emotional attachment one can have towards their beloved. It emphasizes how the mere thought of forgetting their loved one can cause immense pain and torment.\n\nIn this verse, the poet expresses the anguish experienced, even when merely reminiscing about their beloved. The memory of the love they shared is so deeply ingrained that even the thought of it stings their heart. It's not the physical presence, but the emotional bond they share that continues to touch their soul. The poet uses the metaphor of the heart \"burning\" to depict the intense pain and distress caused by their separation.\n\nFurthermore, the poet questions the possibility of their existence if they were ever to completely forget their beloved. This highlights the profound impact of their relationship on their life, to the extent that their existence seems meaningless without the memory of their love. \n\nThis verse vividly portrays the profoundness of true love and the deep emotional connection that transcends physical presence or absence. It also emphasizes the enduring nature of love, which continues to affect one's emotions and life even in the absence of the loved one. \n\nIn a broader sense, this kural can also be interpreted as the pain and longing one can experience due to separation from something or someone deeply cherished. It's a universal sentiment that resonates with anyone who has experienced deep love or attachment..The kural verse:எனைத்து நினைப்பினும் காயார் அனைத்தன்றோகாதலர் செய்யும் சிறப்பு. ,translates to :I bring him to ceaseless memory He chides not; and thus honours me,and it's explantion is :The verse 1208 in Thirukkural talks about the unconditional love and patience that exists in a deep romantic relationship. It discusses the forgiving and enduring nature of a true lover, who does not get angered or irritated, no matter how much their partner thinks or obsesses over them. \n\nIn this Kural, the speaker contemplates the boundless tolerance of their beloved, stating that no matter how excessively they ponder or dwell upon them, their beloved does not show any signs of annoyance or displeasure. Instead, they continue to bestow them with love and kindness. This behavior of the beloved is seen as a remarkable and praiseworthy quality. \n\nThis verse highlights the essence of true love, which is understanding, patience, and forgiveness. It suggests that in a genuine relationship, one's feelings and actions should not lead to the resentment of the other. Rather, it should be a source of joy and delight. This Kural emphasizes the idea that the hallmark of true love is the ability to tolerate and appreciate the other's thoughts and feelings, no matter how intense or overwhelming they might be..The kural verse:விளியுமென் இன்னுயிர் வேறல்லம் என்பார்அளியின்மை ஆற்ற நினைந்து. ,translates to :Dear life ebbs away by thought Of him who said we are one heart,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1209 speaks of the anguish and emotional torment experienced by the speaker who is in love. The verse vividly portrays the pain of feeling neglected and abandoned by the beloved, who had once promised the speaker that they were inseparable.\n\nIn this verse, the speaker laments about their lover who had once claimed that they were not different from each other, implying a deep bond and a promise of undying love. However, the lover's recent actions suggest a lack of compassion and affection, thereby contradicting their earlier assertions. The speaker is deeply affected by this change in their lover's attitude, and this emotional turmoil is causing their life to waste away, indicating their deteriorating physical and mental state due to the constant worry and heartache.\n\nIn essence, this verse highlights the profound impact of deception and betrayal in love. The speaker's intense grief and the feeling of being forsaken by the very person who promised unwavering love, reflects the emotional depth of the verse. The verse also underscores the vulnerability and fragility of human emotions when faced with unreciprocated love and broken promises..The kural verse:விடாஅது சென்றாரைக் கண்ணினால் காணப்படாஅதி வாழி மதி. ,translates to :Hail moon! Set not so that I find Him who left me but not my mind,and it's explantion is :Kural 1210 is a beautiful expression of longing and love. The poet speaks to the moon, pleading it to remain in the sky, so that she might see her beloved who has departed from her. The verse implies that the moonlight is the only source of solace for her in her beloved's absence, providing her with a faint hope of seeing him. \n\nThe phrase \"who has departed without quitting my soul\" highlights the deep emotional bond between the poet and her beloved. Even though physically separated, he continues to occupy her thoughts and feelings. The verse captures the essence of true love - a connection that transcends physical presence and distance. \n\nThe moon here is a symbol of hope and companionship in the night of separation. The plea to the moon not to set signifies her fear of being left in complete darkness, metaphorically indicating her despair and loneliness in her lover's absence. \n\nIn an overarching sense, this verse illustrates the profound pain of separation in love and the clinging hope for reunion, a universal sentiment that resonates with anyone who has experienced deep affection..The kural verse:காதலர் தூதொடு வந்த கனவினுக்குயாதுசெய் வேன்கொல் விருந்து. ,translates to :How shall I feast this dream-vision That brings the beloved's love-mission?,and it's explantion is :Kural 1211 beautifully captures the deep longing and yearning of a lover. The poet asks, \"What feast can I prepare for the dream that brings me a message from my beloved?\" This intriguing question encapsulates the profound yearning of a lover who is separated from their beloved. The messenger here is a metaphor for a dream that brings a glimmer of their beloved's presence. \n\nThe query of the poet emphasizes the intensity of his emotions. The dream is so precious and comforting that he wishes to honor it as one would an esteemed guest. He seeks to show gratitude to this dream which brings him solace in the absence of his beloved. \n\nIn the cultural context, dreams were often believed to be carriers of messages and omens. Thus, the poet's desire to honor the dream underlines his desperate longing for communication with his beloved.\n\nThe verse, in its entirety, is a poignant illustration of the depth of love and the pain of separation. It highlights the human tendency to seek solace in dreams and illusions when reality is too harsh to bear, and our willingness to honor even these illusions for the comfort they bring..The kural verse:கயலுண்கண் யானிரப்பத் துஞ்சிற் கலந்தார்க்குஉயலுண்மை சாற்றுவேன் மன். ,translates to :I beg these fish-like dark eyes sleep To tell my lover how life I keep,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 1212, is a poignant expression of longing and love. In this verse, the poet's persona is a woman deeply in love, yearning for her beloved. She refers to her eyes as \"fish-like painted,\" an imagery often used in classical Tamil poetry to denote the beauty and expressiveness of the eyes. The woman's desire is so intense that she cannot afford to let her eyes close in sleep because she fears missing a moment with her beloved.\n\nHowever, she also notes a paradox here. If she were to allow her eyes to close and sleep, she could then meet her beloved in her dreams. In these dreams, she would be able to express her feelings, her suffering caused by their separation, and reaffirm her enduring love and existence to him. This is a subtle way of expressing the depth of her longing and the pain of their separation. \n\nThis verse is reflective of the intense romantic love that is often depicted in Thiru Kural and other classical Tamil literature. It emphasizes the extent to which love can consume a person, to the point where even sleep is seen as both a barrier to, and a medium for, expressing that love. The moral of this verse may be seen as a commentary on the all-consuming nature of deep emotional connections and the yearning that comes with separation from a beloved..The kural verse:நனவினால் நல்கா தவரைக் கனவினால்காண்டலின் உண்டென் உயிர். ,translates to :In wakeful hours who sees me not I meet in dreams and linger yet,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse 1213 speaks about the intense longing and love that the speaker feels towards their beloved, even though the feelings are not reciprocated. The speaker expresses that their life continues to exist because they are able to see the beloved in their dreams, even though they aren't favored or acknowledged by them in reality. This verse highlights the depth of unrequited love, where the lover finds solace and life force in dreams even when reality is harsh. The persistence of their life is attributed to the hope and joy derived from seeing the beloved in dreams, indicating how powerful the mind can be in influencing one's emotions and will to live. This verse is a poignant depiction of one-sided love and the emotional turmoil it brings, yet also the strength the human heart has to find fragments of happiness in an otherwise painful situation..The kural verse:கனவினான் உண்டாகும் காமம் நனவினான்நல்காரை நாடித் தரற்கு. ,translates to :In dreams I enjoy his love-bliss Who in wakeful hours I miss,and it's explantion is :Kural 1214 delves into the realm of unrequited love, and the comfort that dreams can provide in such situations. The verse is built upon a poignant depiction of longing and unfulfilled desire.\n\nThe verse states, \"There is pleasure in my dream, because in it I seek and obtain him who does not visit me in my wakefulness.\" This represents a deep yearning for someone who doesn't reciprocate the same feelings or doesn't express their affection in reality. The dream, in this context, becomes a refuge where the poet is able to interact with his beloved, a scenario he's unable to experience when he's awake.\n\nThis verse emphasizes the power of dreams in providing solace and a space to live out unfulfilled desires. It also highlights the intense emotional pain of unreciprocated love, where the person finds joy only in the illusions of their dreams, as reality offers them no such comfort.\n\nIn a wider perspective, this verse could also be interpreted as the human tendency to imagine and hold onto ideal scenarios or people in our minds, regardless of the actual reality. The dreams symbolize our desires and hopes, which can often be a source of both joy and pain..The kural verse:நனவினால் கண்டதூஉம் ஆங்கே கனவுந்தான்கண்ட பொழுதே இனிது. ,translates to :Dream-sight of him delights at once Awake-What of seeing him -hence,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural speaks on the theme of longing and love. It conveys the joy and pleasure derived from seeing a beloved one, not only in reality but also in dreams.\n\nIn this verse, the poet shares an intimate emotion of a lover who finds immense pleasure in seeing their beloved, both during their waking hours and in their dreams. It emphasizes how the beloved's presence, whether in reality or in dreams, brings immense joy and happiness.\n\nThe poet uses the comparison between the waking state and the dream state to illustrate the depth of the individual's affection. The joy derived from the sight of the beloved in the waking state is as delightful as seeing them in dreams. This verse beautifully articulates the profoundness of love that transcends the boundaries of reality and enters the realm of dreams, making them equally delightful.\n\nIn essence, this verse encapsulates the enduring nature of love that persists in our consciousness, both when we are awake and when we are asleep. The beloved's image permeates the lover's thoughts, dominating their waking hours and dreams, bringing a sense of joy and contentment..The kural verse:நனவென ஒன்றில்லை ஆயின் கனவினால்காதலர் நீங்கலர் மன். ,translates to :If wakeful hours come to nought My lov'r in dreams would nev'r depart,and it's explantion is :The verse 1216 from Thirukkural vividly describes the longing and yearning one experiences in love. In this verse, the poet laments about the transience of dreams and the stark reality of wakefulness.\n\nOn a literal level, the poet says, \"If there was no such thing as wakefulness, my beloved, who visited me in my dream, would not depart.\" The poet is entwined in deep love and even dreams of his beloved. But upon waking, the harsh reality sets in, and the beloved is no longer there. The poet wishes that if there was no waking up, the dream would continue, and the beloved would never leave.\n\nThis verse conveys the intensity of love, where the lover longs to be with their beloved, even if it is only in dreams. It portrays the idea that love can be so profound that the boundary between dreams and reality blurs.\n\nThe cultural context of this verse aligns with the traditional Tamil concept of love, where separation is often seen as a painful part of the romantic experience. It also emphasizes the power of dreams, which can provide a temporary relief from the harsh reality of separation.\n\nOn a moral level, the Kural might suggest that one should not let oneself be consumed by longing and yearning, as it can lead to a state of perpetual dissatisfaction and suffering. The reality might be bitter, but one should learn to face it rather than escaping into the world of dreams..The kural verse:நனவினால் நல்காக் கொடியார் கனவனால்என்எம்மைப் பீழிப் பது. ,translates to :Awake he throws my overtures Adream, ah cruel! he tortures!,and it's explantion is :The verse 1217 from Thiru Kural is a reflection of human emotions and the impact of negative interactions on one's psyche. This verse is a rhetorical question that expresses the anguish and frustration of the speaker who is tormented by someone who shows no kindness in reality, and then continues to torment him even in his dreams. \n\nThe verse reveals the profound influence that our waking interactions can have on our subconscious thoughts, surfacing in our dreams. The cruel person who shows no favor or kindness in the waking world has no right, says the poet, to inflict pain and suffering even in the dream world. \n\nThe verse is a metaphor for the unwanted and persistent influence of tormentors in one's life. It underlines the importance of kindness, empathy, and compassion in our interactions with others, as it can have a significant emotional impact on them. The verse is also a call for respect for personal boundaries, even in the abstract world of dreams. \n\nIn the cultural context, dreams are considered as an extension of one's subconscious thoughts and experiences in Tamil philosophy. Thus, a cruel person causing distress in one's dreams symbolizes the deep-seated impact of their cruelty on the individual's mind.\n\nIn summary, the verse is a poignant commentary on the profound effect of cruelty and unkindness, and a call for empathy and compassion in our interactions with others..The kural verse:துஞ்சுங்கால் தோள்மேலர் ஆகி விழிக்குங்கால்நெஞ்சத்தர் ஆவர் விரைந்து. ,translates to :Asleep he embraces me fast; Awake he enters quick my heart,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural is rich in its metaphorical representation of intense love and longing. It beautifully captures the depth of affection and the constant presence of the beloved in the lover's life.\n\nThe poet says, \"When I am asleep, he rests on my shoulders\", which signifies the lover's presence even in her dreams. He becomes a part of her subconscious thoughts, offering a sense of comfort and warmth. The imagery of the beloved resting on the lover's shoulders indicates a feeling of closeness and emotional intimacy that transcends the physical realm.\n\nThe second line, \"When I awake, he hastens into my soul\" further illustrates the omnipresence of the beloved in the lover's life. Upon waking, the lover feels the beloved's presence within her soul, signifying the deep emotional bond that they share. The beloved is not just a part of her dreams, but also a part of her conscious thoughts, emotions, and existence. He is so deeply ingrained in her being that he becomes a part of her soul.\n\nIn essence, this verse poignantly depicts the all-encompassing nature of profound love. Whether awake or asleep, the lover is constantly connected to the beloved, demonstrating the inseparability of their souls. It underscores that true love is not limited to physical presence; rather, it permeates the subconscious mind and the soul, creating an enduring bond..The kural verse:நனவினால் நல்காரை நோவர் கனவினால்காதலர்க் காணா தவர். ,translates to :In dreams who don't discern lovers Rue their missing in wakeful hours,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse 1219 speaks about the longing and yearning of unrequited love. The verse essentially says that those who have no beloved ones to dream about are the ones who complain about their lovers not visiting them in their waking hours. \n\nThe verse highlights the concept of longing in love, where the beloved's absence is felt more acutely. The dream is used as a metaphor here to indicate the mental and emotional presence of the loved one, even when physically absent. If one can dream of their beloved, it means they hold a strong emotional bond and a deep sense of connection with them. \n\nHowever, those who don't have such a connection or the ability to dream about their beloved feel the absence more intensely. They are the ones who complain about their beloved not being present in their waking hours. This verse underscores the emotional dependency of love, and the pain and longing that comes with unfulfilled or unreciprocated love. \n\nIn a broader perspective, it also hints at the human tendency to value and long for what is not easily available or accessible rather than cherishing what one already possesses..The kural verse:நனவினால் நம்நீத்தார் என்பர் கனவினால்காணார்கொல் இவ்வூ ரவர். ,translates to :The townsmen say he left me thus  In dreams failing to see him close,and it's explantion is :Kural 1220 explores the profound depth of love, particularly the longing a person experiences when separated from their beloved. In this verse, the poet uses the metaphor of dreams to illustrate the boundless reach of love and the unceasing thoughts one has for the beloved, even in their absence.\n\nThe verse speaks from the perspective of a woman who is separated from her lover. People around her accuse her lover of leaving her, judging their love based on his physical absence. However, she retorts that they are unable to comprehend the depth of their love because they have not seen him visit her in her dreams. \n\nThis verse is an expression of the intense longing and profound love that remains, despite the physical separation. It suggests that true love transcends physical presence, reaching into the realm of dreams and thoughts. The woman's dreams of her lover indicate her continued emotional connection and devotion to him, which the others fail to understand. \n\nThus, the Kural conveys that love is not merely a physical relationship but a deep emotional bond that persists in memory and imagination. It also highlights the judgment and misunderstanding society often has towards love and separation, emphasizing that true love's depth and strength are often beyond external appearances..The kural verse:மாலையோ அல்லை மணந்தார் உயிருண்ணும்வேலைநீ வாழி பொழுது. ,translates to :Bless you! you are not eventide But killing dart to wedded bride!,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1221 is a poignant verse that captures the melancholic sentiments of separated lovers during the evening. In this verse, Valluvar personifies the evening and addresses it directly. \n\n\"Live, O you evening are you (the former) evening? No, you are the season that slays (married) women,\" he says. Here, the \"evening\" is not the peaceful, tranquil time of day as it once was for the lovers. Rather, it is depicted as a ruthless slayer, a harbinger of sorrow and longing for those women who are separated from their beloved ones.\n\nThe verse uses the metaphor of evening as a time that 'eats' or 'consumes' the life of those who are in love but are separated. This is a common theme in classical Tamil literature, where the pain of separation is often compared to a slow, torturous death.\n\nIn ancient Tamil society, married women often stayed with their husband's family and were separated from their loved ones. The evening, a time when work ceases and people retreat to their homes, would be particularly painful for these women, as it would remind them of their separation from their beloved.\n\nIn essence, the verse is a lament on the pain of separation, and the cruel role that time (as symbolized by the evening) plays in exacerbating that pain. The verse is a reminder that love and longing are universal human experiences, and that time - whether it is the cycle of day and night or the passing of seasons - can profoundly influence our emotions and state of mind..The kural verse:புன்கண்ணை வாழி மருள்மாலை எம்கேள்போல்வன்கண்ண தோநின் துணை. ,translates to :Hail sad eventide dim and grim Has your mate like mine, cruel whim!,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural speaks metaphorically about the state of a lovelorn lady who addresses the evening - a time of transition between day and night. This is a common trope in Tamil classical literature, where nature is often personified and used as a medium to express human emotions.\n\nThe lady, pining for her distant beloved, compares her own state to that of the evening. She notes that the evening, like her, seems to be in a state of darkness (metaphorically, a state of sorrow and longing). She uses the term 'sightless' for the evening, indicating the fading light, and aligns it with her own despair in the absence of her lover.\n\nFurther, she wonders if the evening's companion, the night, is as hard-hearted as her own lover who has left her in this state of longing. The 'hard-heartedness' here refers to the lover's seeming indifference to her pain of separation.\n\nThe verse poignantly portrays the depth of her longing and the extent of her sorrow, as she identifies her own state with that of the evening. It also subtly criticizes the lover for his insensitivity, by comparing him to the dark, harsh night that follows the 'sightless' evening.\n\nFinally, it can be interpreted as a comment on the universal experience of longing and waiting, and the pain of separation, which is as relentless and inevitable as the cycle of day and night..The kural verse:பனிஅரும்பிப் பைதல்கொள் மாலை துனிஅரும்பித்துன்பம் வளர வரும். ,translates to :Wet eve came pale and trembling then Now it makes bold with growing pain,and it's explantion is :Kural 1223 is a poignant verse that captures the deep sense of longing and sorrow of a lover separated from their beloved. In the verse, Valluvar uses the metaphor of the evening to express the speaker's emotional state.\n\nIn the first line, Valluvar refers to the evening \"that once came in with trembling and dimness\". This is a poetic way of illustrating the anticipation and excitement that the speaker once felt as the evening approached, bringing with it the possibility of meeting their loved one. The trembling could signify the nervousness and thrill of love, while the dimness could symbolize the soft, intimate atmosphere of the evening.\n\nHowever, in the second line, the tone shifts drastically. The same evening that once brought joy now brings \"an aversion for life and increasing sorrow\". This indicates a deep sense of loss and longing. The speaker's beloved is no longer there to share the evening with them, and what was once a time of happiness has turned into a time of despair and sadness. The aversion for life suggests the depth of the speaker's grief, while the increasing sorrow shows the pain that grows with each passing evening.\n\nThrough this verse, Valluvar highlights the intense emotions associated with love and separation. He underscores the transformative power of love, showing how it can turn even the most mundane aspects of life, like the arrival of evening, into sources of profound joy or sorrow. This verse is a testament to the timeless nature of human emotions and the universal experience of love and longing..The kural verse:காதலர் இல்வழி மாலை கொலைக்களத்துஏதிலர் போல வரும். ,translates to :Lover away, comes eventide Like slayer to field of homicide,and it's explantion is :The Thiru Kural verse 1224 poetically expresses the intense longing and sadness that accompanies separation from a beloved. This verse describes the evening's arrival, in the absence of a lover, as akin to the appearance of ruthless killers on a battlefield. \n\nIn a deeper sense, the evening symbolizes the end of day and the onset of darkness, both literally and metaphorically. Just as the end of day brings darkness, the absence of the beloved brings a metaphorical darkness, a sense of sorrow and despair, into the life of the one left behind. \n\nThe battlefield analogy intensifies the feeling of dread and desolation. Much like how the arrival of merciless killers on a battlefield would signal impending doom and destruction, the arrival of evening in the absence of the lover feels like an ominous sign of emotional torment. \n\nThis verse captures the raw emotion of separation in love. It is a poignant reminder of how deeply the presence or absence of a loved one can affect one's perception of the world. \n\nThe verse underscores the universal human experience of longing for a loved one's presence and the profound sense of melancholy that accompanies their absence. It serves as a metaphor for the emotional turmoil and distress experienced during moments of separation, regardless of the circumstances. The verse is a powerful expression of the deep emotional impact that love and separation can have on an individual..The kural verse:காலைக்குச் செய்தநன்று என்கொல் எவன்கொல்யான்மாலைக்குச் செய்த பகை? ,translates to :What good have I done to morning And what evil to this evening?,and it's explantion is :Kural 1225 speaks about the emotional anguish of separation, a common theme in Thirukkural's 'Inbam', the book of love.\n\nThe verse expresses the agony of a lover who is distanced from their beloved. As the day progresses to evening, their longing intensifies, turning the peaceful evening into a symbol of strife. This leads the lover to question the evening, personified here as a conscious entity capable of causing harm or good.\n\nThey ask, \"What good did I do to the morning that it passes peacefully? And what wrong did I do to the evening that it brings such sorrow?\" The rhetorical questions underline the intense pain of separation, suggesting that their emotional state is influenced more by their longing for their beloved than by the natural progression of the day.\n\nThe verse reflects the universal human experience of time feeling different based on our emotional state. It highlights the deep emotional distress that love and separation can cause, turning even the natural cycle of day and night into a source of torment. \n\nIn a broader sense, it also illustrates how our perception of reality can be heavily influenced by our emotional state, turning neutral or even beautiful entities (like evening) into sources of pain..The kural verse:மாலைநோய் செய்தல் மணந்தார் அகலாதகாலை அறிந்த திலேன். ,translates to :Evening pangs I have not known When my lord nev'r left me alone,and it's explantion is :Kural 1226 explores the theme of longing and separation in love. The verse is narrated from the perspective of a woman who is missing her beloved partner. She reminisces about their time together and reflects on how the evenings, which were once filled with joy and companionship, have now become a source of sorrow due to her partner's absence. \n\nThe verse translates to, \"Before my husband's departure, I was unaware of the painful nature of the evening.\" This statement highlights the change in her perspective due to her changed circumstances. The evenings, which were once pleasant and enjoyable, have now turned into a time of pain and longing due to her husband's absence. \n\nIt's a poignant commentary on how our perception of time and situations can drastically change based on our emotional state. The woman's sense of time has been altered by her emotional longing for her husband. What was once a joyous part of her day has now become a painful reminder of her solitude. \n\nThis verse also implies the deep bond and affection she shared with her husband, as his absence has such a profound impact on her. It's a testament to the depth of their love and the hardship of their separation. The verse uses the metaphor of the evening to illustrate the emotional landscape of longing and separation in love..The kural verse:காலை அரும்பிப் பகலெல்லாம் போதாகிமாலை மலரும்இந் நோய். ,translates to :Budding at dawn burgeoning all day This disease blooms in evening gay,and it's explantion is :Kural 1227 beautifully personifies the experience of romantic love as a blossoming flower. The verse metaphorically suggests that love starts budding in the morning, grows throughout the day, and fully blossoms by the evening. \n\nThis metaphor is rich with emotional progression. The morning signifies the early stages of love, where it is just starting to form. As the day progresses, the feelings of love grow stronger and deeper, much like a bud growing and preparing to bloom. By the evening, the bud becomes a fully blossomed flower, symbolizing that love has reached its peak, full of intensity and passion.\n\nThis verse subtly indicates the consuming nature of love, how it can take over one's thoughts and emotions throughout the day. It also addresses the beauty and intensity of love, as well as its transformative power, much like a bud transforming into a beautiful flower.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar uses the metaphor of a blossoming flower to capture the progression and intensity of romance, highlighting its all-consuming and transformative nature..The kural verse:அழல்போலும் மாலைக்குத் தூதாகி ஆயன்குழல்போலும் கொல்லும் படை. ,translates to :A deadly arm, this shepherd's flute Hails flaming eve and slays my heart,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1228 is a poignant verse that focuses on the pain of separation in love, using rich and symbolic imagery. \n\nThe verse describes the shepherd's flute (representing the beloved's voice or presence) that once sounded sweet and comforting, is now like a herald of the painful twilight, representing the onset of separation. The reference to the flute sounding like a fiery forerunner of the night is a metaphor for the intense emotional turmoil experienced at the onset of dusk, a time characterized by absence and longing.\n\nFurthermore, the flute is likened to a weapon that slays, signifying how the memory of the beloved's voice or their absence inflicts deep emotional pain, equivalent to a fatal wound. This metaphor underlines the intensity of the lover's longing and sorrow in their separation.\n\nSo, in essence, this verse beautifully captures the pain of separation in love, using the metaphor of a shepherd's flute turning from a source of joy to a symbol of sorrow and longing. It emphasizes how objects or sounds associated with a loved one can trigger powerful emotions and longing in their absence..The kural verse:பதிமருண்டு பைதல் உழக்கும் மதிமருண்டுமாலை படர்தரும் போழ்து. ,translates to :Deluding eve if it prolongs The whole town will suffer love-pangs,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1229 is a metaphorical verse that speaks about the agony of separation from a beloved one. The poet uses the coming of the evening as a metaphor to describe the descending gloom and psychological distress in his mind due to the absence of his beloved.\n\n\"When night comes on confusing (everyone's) mind, the (whole) town will lose its sense and be plunged in sorrow.\" Here, the night is symbolic of the darkness and sorrow that has engulfed the poet's heart. It's the time when his longing for his beloved intensifies, causing him deep distress. The poet feels as though his personal torment is so profound that it seems to affect the entire town, making it appear as if everyone is sharing in his sorrow and despair.\n\nThe verse vividly illustrates the depth of the poet's love and the profound sense of loss he feels during his beloved's absence. It underscores how intensely personal emotions can color one's perception of the world around them. \n\nThe poet essentially shares that his grief is so overwhelming that it blurs his rationality, just like the arrival of the evening that brings darkness, obscuring the clarity of the day and plunging the town into sorrow. It communicates the universal human experience of longing and the pain of separation in love..The kural verse:பொருள்மாலை யாளரை உள்ளி மருள்மாலைமாயும்என் மாயா உயிர். ,translates to :Thinking of him whose quest is wealth My life outlives the twilight stealth,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural is a beautiful expression of profound love and longing. It describes the speaker's deep affliction due to separation from their beloved, who is referred to as \"one who possesses the nature of wealth.\"\n\nThe imagery of \"bewildering night\" represents confusion, darkness, and the complexity of emotions the speaker is experiencing. It suggests the state of despair and desolation they feel as they ponder their beloved's absence. \n\nThe \"unextinguished life\" symbolizes the speaker's survival, albeit in a state of emotional turmoil and suffering, despite the heart-wrenching separation. The fact that the life is \"now lost\" signifies their lamenting heart's surrender to the overwhelming emotions, consumed by the thought of their beloved.\n\nIn the cultural context, wealth in this verse can be interpreted as their beloved's attributes and qualities that are deeply cherished and valued, much like material wealth. The \"bewildering night\" and the \"unextinguished life\" poignantly depict the torment of separation and the melancholy of unfulfilled love.\n\nIn essence, the verse captures the intense emotions of longing and despair that come with separation from a loved one. It highlights the power of love to consume one's mind and life, and its ability to cause both profound joy and deep sorrow..The kural verse:சிறுமை நமக்கொழியச் சேட்சென்றார் உள்ளிநறுமலர் நாணின கண். ,translates to :To lift from want he left me afar His thought makes my eyes blush the flower,and it's explantion is :Kural 1231 is a deeply emotional verse that explores the pain of separation in love. The verse talks about the agony that a lover experiences when the beloved has gone far away. The pain is so intense that even the sight of fragrant flowers, which once brought joy, now brings sadness and is avoided. \n\nIn this verse, the poet brings to life the profound sorrow experienced by a lover through the metaphor of weeping eyes and shunning of fragrant flowers. The eyes, once bright and lively, are now dull and tearful due to the longing for the beloved. The fragrant flowers, which were once a source of pleasure and delight, are now a reminder of the beloved and thus cause more pain.\n\nIn the cultural context, flowers are often associated with love and romance. But in the face of separation, even these symbols of love become a source of grief, reminding the lover of their beloved who is now out of sight. This verse thus captures the intense emotional turmoil that separation can bring in love.\n\nThe moral interpretation of the verse can be seen as a commentary on the impermanence of life and the inevitability of separation. It serves as a reminder that intense attachment can lead to deep sorrow. However, the verse also acknowledges the human capacity to love deeply, even in the face of suffering and separation..The kural verse:நயந்தவர் நல்காமை சொல்லுவ போலும்பசந்து பனிவாரும் கண். ,translates to :My pale tearful eyes betray The hardness of my husband, away,and it's explantion is :Kural 1232 laments the unkindness of a beloved from the perspective of the speaker. In this verse, the poet uses vivid imagery of tear-filled, discolored eyes to express a deep sense of emotional pain and betrayal. The teary eyes are depicted as messengers that reveal the harsh truth of the beloved's indifference or unkindness.\n\nThe verse implies that, just as the eyes cannot hide their tears, the pain of unrequited love cannot be concealed. The sorrow is so profound that it seems to visibly manifest itself, much like tears that betray the emotion behind them. Through this, the poet subtly conveys the depth of the speaker's disappointment and heartbreak over the beloved's lack of affection.\n\nThis Kural emphasizes the raw and intense emotional suffering that can arise from unreciprocated love, and it underscores the importance of empathy and kindness in all relationships. It encourages the reader to consider the impact of their actions on others, reminding us that indifference can cause immense pain to those who love us..The kural verse:தணந்தமை சால அறிவிப்ப போலும்மணந்தநாள் வீங்கிய தோள். ,translates to :These arms that swelled on nuptial day Now shrunk proclaim \\\"He is away\\\",and it's explantion is :Kural 1233 is a poignant verse that speaks about the visible manifestations of a lover's separation. The verse metaphorically uses the physical attributes of a woman to express the emotional pain of parting from her beloved. \n\nIn this verse, the poet describes how the woman's shoulders, which once swelled with joy and pride on the day of their union, have now shrunk and withered due to the pain of separation. The physical change in her appearance, therefore, seems to announce their separation to the world.\n\nThe verse conveys the depth of her sorrow and how her physical state reflects her emotional turmoil. It is a poignant reminder of how deeply emotional experiences can impact a person's physical state. The verse also implicitly highlights societal norms of the time, where a woman's happiness and well-being were often closely tied to her relationship with her husband.\n\nIn essence, this verse encapsulates the profound influence of love and separation on a person's physical and emotional state, and how the two are deeply interlinked. It provides a glimpse into the deep emotional bond between lovers and the pain of parting, which is universally felt and understood..The kural verse:பணைநீங்கிப் பைந்தொடி சோரும் துணைநீங்கித்தொல்கவின் வாடிய தோள். ,translates to :Bracelets slip off the arms that have Lost old beauty for He took leave,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 1234, is a poignant depiction of the physical and emotional toll of separation on a person. The verse metaphorically represents the profound pain of separation from a beloved one, causing a physical manifestation of the heartache.\n\nThe verse states that in the absence of one's consort, the shoulders lose their former beauty and fullness, suggesting the loss of vitality and energy due to the grief of separation. The 'bracelets of pure gold' becoming loose is a metaphorical way of expressing extreme weight loss, as a result of the emotional distress.\n\nThe verse highlights the significance of companionship and the profound impact its absence can have on one's physical and mental health. It underscores the depth of love and attachment one could have for their partner, such that their departure induces a physical decline. \n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes the profound emotional connection between the mind and body, and how deeply our relationships can influence our wellbeing..The kural verse:கொடியார் கொடுமை உரைக்கும் தொடியொடுதொல்கவின் வாடிய தோள். ,translates to :Bereft of bracelets and old beauty Arms tell the cruel's cruelty,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse 1235, speaks about the pain of separation in love. The woman's physical condition is used as a metaphor to describe the intensity of her suffering caused by the absence of her beloved.\n\n\"The (loosened) bracelets and the shoulders from which the old beauty has faded, relate the cruelty of the pitiless one\" - This verse talks about a woman whose bracelets have become loose and whose shoulders have lost their old beauty, the result of her lover's absence. Here, the \"pitiless one\" refers to the woman's lover who has left her, and his perceived cruelty is her pain due to his absence. \n\nThe verse beautifully captures the physical manifestations of emotional pain in the woman. Her weight loss due to sadness and longing is indicated by the loosening of her bracelets. Similarly, the fading beauty of her shoulders signifies her deterioration of health and vigor due to her heartache. The verse poignantly highlights the deep impact of love and separation on a person's physical and emotional state.\n\nThe cultural context here lies in the symbolism of the bracelets and the shoulders. In traditional Tamil culture, a woman's beauty was often associated with her physical attributes like the fullness of her arms, indicated by tight bracelets, and the attractiveness of her shoulders. Thus, the changes in these physical aspects were seen as signs of her emotional state.\n\nThe moral interpretation of this verse can be seen as a commentary on the profound effects of love and separation. It implies that emotional wellbeing is deeply intertwined with physical health and that the pain of heartbreak can have tangible physical manifestations. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of empathy and understanding in relationships, as the woman's lover, being oblivious to her suffering, is labeled as 'pitiless'..The kural verse:தொடியொடு தோள்நெகிழ நோவல் அவரைக்கொடியர் எனக்கூறல் நொந்து. ,translates to :Arms thin, armlets loose make you call My sire cruel; that pains my soul,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse (1236) portrays the deep pain of a lover who is distressed by the physical changes in her beloved due to their separation. The verse describes how the beloved has lost weight to such an extent that her bracelets have loosened and her shoulders have become thin. This has led others to label her lover as cruel for causing her such suffering.\n\nHowever, the speaker in the verse expresses anguish not at her lover's supposed cruelty, but at the misinterpretation of others who view his absence as an act of unkindness. The speaker is in profound pain upon hearing these accusations against her lover, as she understands the complexity of their situation and his true feelings. This verse hence emphasizes the depth of understanding and empathy in true love.\n\nIt's a reminder that external judgments often fail to grasp the nuances of personal relationships and circumstances. The verse underlines the painful effects of separation, but also the strength of love that endures despite hardships and misunderstandings..The kural verse:பாடு பெறுதியோ நெஞ்சே கொடியார்க்கென்வாடுதோட் பூசல் உரைத்து. ,translates to :Go and tell the cruel, O mind  Bruit ov'r my arms and glory find,and it's explantion is :Kural 1237 is a poignant expression of unrequited love and emotional pain. It is a rhetorical question addressed to the poet's own heart, questioning the futility of expressing his suffering to the one who is causing it. \n\nThe phrase 'the cruel one' is a reference to the beloved who is indifferent or unresponsive to the poet's love. The 'fading shoulders' symbolize the physical and emotional toll that this unrequited love is taking on the poet. The 'clamour' is a metaphor for the poet's complaints or expressions of his suffering.\n\nThe poet is essentially asking his heart, \"What is the point of explaining my suffering to the one who is causing it? Will it bring any glory or satisfaction?\" This Kural portrays the depth of the poet's anguish and the sense of despair he feels, given the indifference of his beloved to his pain. \n\nThis verse is a reflection on the human condition when love is not reciprocated, and the futility of seeking empathy or understanding from someone who is indifferent to one's emotions. It is a profound commentary on the complexities of love and the emotional turmoil it can cause..The kural verse:முயங்கிய கைகளை ஊக்கப் பசந்ததுபைந்தொடிப் பேதை நுதல். ,translates to :The front of this fair one O paled As my clasping arms loosed their hold,and it's explantion is :This Kural, verse 1238, is a vivid depiction of the deep emotional bond and affection in a romantic relationship. The poet talks about a scenario where he slightly loosens his embrace with his beloved. The very act of creating even a minor separation causes such distress to his lover that her face loses its radiance and turns pale - a metaphorical expression indicating the depth of her love and how she is troubled by even the smallest distance between them.\n\nThe physical description of the woman's forehead turning sallow, as mentioned in the verse, is a poetic illustration of her emotional state. It highlights the profound effect of their love and the intensity of her longing for his closeness. The \"gold-braceleted\" woman symbolizes her elegance and charm, which is momentarily lost due to the pain of separation, however slight it might be.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse also emphasizes the value of closeness and unity in a relationship. It suggests that even the smallest act of distancing can bring about discomfort and sadness, thus underlining the importance of maintaining closeness and harmony in a loving relationship..The kural verse:முயக்கிடைத் தண்வளி போழப் பசப்புற்றபேதை பெருமழைக் கண். ,translates to :Cool breeze crept between our embrace Her large rain-cloud-eyes paled at once,and it's explantion is :Kural 1239 is an evocative verse that explores the depth of romantic intimacy and the sensitivity of lovers. In this verse, Valluvar describes a scenario where the lovers are so close that even a slight breeze that penetrates their embrace is perceived as an intrusion, causing distress.\n\nThe verse vividly paints the picture of two lovers in a tight embrace, symbolizing their unity and deep affection. The \"cool breeze\" that enters their embrace is seemingly harmless and gentle, yet it is enough to cause discomfort, as it is seen as a disturbance to their intimate moment. This suggests the intensity of their connection, where even the slightest separation is unbearable.\n\nThe \"large cool eyes\" of the lady become \"sallow,\" indicating her sadness at the interruption. Her eyes are compared to a \"large rain,\" suggesting their depth and expressiveness. The change in their color to a sallow, or a sickly yellowish hue, is a metaphor for the emotional distress caused by the separation, however brief it may be.\n\nThis verse, thus, beautifully encapsulates the profound sensitivity and depth of feelings in a romantic relationship. Even the smallest disruptions are magnified in the context of this intense love, and the lovers crave for uninterrupted togetherness..The kural verse:கண்ணின் பசப்போ பருவரல் எய்தின்றேஒண்ணுதல் செய்தது கண்டு. ,translates to :Pale eyes pained seeing the pallor Of the bright forehead of this fair,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural talks about the pain and sorrow of separation in love. The verse poetically describes how the bright forehead of the beloved, which has become pale due to the sadness of separation, influences the eyes of the lover, causing them to also turn sallow or sad.\n\nThe metaphorical comparison of the beloved's forehead and the lover's eyes is used to illustrate the deep emotional connection between them. The pain and sorrow of one becomes the pain and sorrow of the other. The verse, therefore, underscores the deep empathy and understanding that true love entails.\n\nThe verse also explores the physical manifestations of emotional pain. Just as the beloved's forehead has turned pale due to sadness, the lover's eyes also reflect the same sallowness, showing how emotions can physically alter one's appearance.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can also be interpreted as an observation of human relationships where emotions and feelings are often infectious, passing from one person to the other. In this particular case, it's the sadness of separation in love, but it could be any strong emotion. This highlights the interconnectedness of human emotions and the profound impact they can have on each other..The kural verse:நினைத்தொன்று சொல்லாயோ நெஞ்சே எனைத்தொன்றும்எவ்வநோய் தீர்க்கும் மருந்து. ,translates to :Think of, O heart, some remedy To cure this chronic malady,and it's explantion is :The verse 1241 from Thirukkural is a passionate expression of the intense love felt by the speaker. In this couplet, the speaker is addressing their own heart, seeking a remedy for the 'incurable malady' of love. The speaker is in a state of desperation and is willing to consider any possible remedy, no matter what it may be. The metaphor used here is that of a disease and its cure. The speaker's love is likened to a persistent and incurable disease that causes constant suffering. \n\nThe verse emphasizes the overwhelming nature of intense love, which can consume a person to the point where they feel as though they are ill. It also conveys the sense of helplessness the speaker feels in the face of this powerful emotion, as they are unable to find a remedy on their own and thus turn to their heart for guidance. \n\nThis verse, like many others in Thirukkural, uses the universal theme of love to convey deeper human emotions and predicaments, making it relatable to readers across different cultures and time periods. The ability to express such profound sentiments in a concise manner is one of the hallmarks of Thirukkural. Here, the poet captures the essence of an individual's struggle with overwhelming emotions and the desperation to find relief..The kural verse:காதல் அவரிலர் ஆகநீ நோவதுபேதைமை வாழியென் நெஞ்சு. ,translates to :Bless O mind! you pine in vain For me he has no love serene,and it's explantion is :Kural 1242 is a poignant reflection on unrequited love and the foolishness of longing for someone who does not reciprocate your feelings. It is a conversation with the heart, the seat of emotions, urging it to live on despite the pain of unfulfilled love. \n\nThe verse reads, \"Is folly, fare thee well my heart!\". This is a farewell note to the heart, which continues to love someone who does not return the affection. The speaker is realizing the futility and foolishness of their unreturned affection. They are making a conscious decision to move on, acknowledging that persisting in this one-sided love is nothing more than ignorance or folly.\n\nThe various Tamil explanations emphasize the same theme. They translate to, \"When they do not appreciate our love and do not come to us, my heart, thinking of them and suffering is ignorance; you live on,\" \"My heart, live! They do not love us, your suffering thinking only of them is your ignorance!\" and \"My heart, you live on; they do not love us, you alone thinking of their arrival and suffering is foolish.\"\n\nIn essence, this verse speaks about the wisdom in accepting the reality of unrequited love and the need to move forward, rather than dwelling on the pain and longing that it brings..The kural verse:இருந்துள்ளி என்பரிதல் நெஞ்சே பரிந்துள்ளல்பைதல்நோய் செய்தார்கண் இல். ,translates to :O mind, why pine and sit moody? Who made you so pale lacks pity,and it's explantion is :Kural 1243 is an exquisite expression of unrequited love. It's a plea from the poet to his own heart, questioning why it chooses to remain in a state of anguish due to a love that is not reciprocated.\n\nIn this verse, the poet is asking his heart why it continues to stay and suffer by thinking about the one who caused it so much sorrow. It questions the point of this suffering when the person in question does not harbor any affectionate thoughts towards the poet. The person who has caused the heartache is not concerned or moved by the poet's love, which intensifies the poet's misery.\n\nThis verse is a poignant reminder of the torment of one-sided love. It captures the despair felt by those whose affections are not returned, and the futile hope that their feelings might one day be reciprocated. It underlines the reality that unrequited love only leads to sorrow and pain.\n\nIn a broader sense, this Kural is also a philosophical commentary on human attachments and desires. It encourages introspection and self-questioning when we find ourselves suffering due to unfulfilled desires or attachments. It prompts us to reconsider our emotional investments and to let go of those that do not bring us joy or reciprocation. Ultimately, the message is about the importance of self-love and emotional independence..The kural verse:கண்ணும் கொளச்சேறி நெஞ்சே இவையென்னைத்தின்னும் அவர்க்காணல் உற்று. ,translates to :Take these eyes and meet him, O heart Or their hunger will eat me out,and it's explantion is :Kural 1244 is a passionate verse about longing and yearning in love. The speaker is addressing their own heart, expressing the intense desire to see their beloved and the pain caused by their absence.\n\nThe verse metaphorically suggests that the speaker's eyes, in their intense desire to see the beloved, might consume the speaker themselves if not satisfied. This verse expresses the profound effect of love where every part of the lover yearns for the sight of the beloved. The eyes are personified as entities with their own desire and longing.\n\nThis verse vividly captures the essence of longing in love - so intense that it feels almost unbearable. The speaker's plea to their heart to take their eyes along when it goes to see their beloved shows the interconnectedness of physical and emotional aspects of passionate love. The verse emphasizes the idea that love is not just a feeling in the heart, but it affects and involves the whole being. \n\nIn a broader interpretation, this verse underscores the power of desire and longing, and how these feelings can consume an individual if not satisfied. The Kural thus suggests that it is important to satisfy one's legitimate desires and longings to maintain inner peace and harmony..The kural verse:செற்றார் எனக்கை விடல்உண்டோ நெஞ்சேயாம்உற்றால் உறாஅ தவர். ,translates to :He spurns our love and yet, O mind, Can we desert him as unkind?,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural is essentially exploring the complexities of unrequited love. The speaker is having a conversation with their own heart, questioning if it is possible to let go of their love and affection for someone, even when that person is not reciprocating their feelings.\n\nThe speaker is in a state of emotional turmoil, where they are deeply in love with someone who does not return their affections. The verse raises an internal debate on whether they should continue loving this person, or if they should attempt to abandon their feelings, thinking that this person 'hates' them.\n\nThe depth of this verse illustrates the pain and dilemma of unrequited love. It demonstrates the inner conflict that one goes through when their love is not reciprocated, highlighting the struggle between the heart's desire to continue loving and the mind's reasoning to let go. Hence, it serves as a profound reflection on the human capacity to love and the emotional agony of unrequited affection. \n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes the difficulty in letting go of someone you deeply love, even when they do not love you back. It expresses the emotional struggle and the resilience of love in the face of rejection..The kural verse:கலந்துணர்த்தும் காதலர்க் கண்டாற் புலந்துணராய்பொய்க்காய்வு காய்திஎன் நெஞ்சு. ,translates to :Wrath is false, O heart, face-to face Sans huff, you rush to his sweet embrace,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1246 is a passionate expression of the complex emotions associated with love. The verse addresses the speaker's heart and speaks of the paradoxical behavior it exhibits upon encountering the beloved.\n\nThe verse begins by acknowledging that the beloved has the power to dispel any dislike or resentment through their companionship and interaction. The beloved's presence, their words, and their actions have the ability to soothe the wounds of any conflict or misunderstanding. Yet, the speaker's heart, upon seeing the beloved, reacts not with joy, but with a kind of feigned anger or displeasure.\n\nThe speaker is calling out his own heart for its fraudulent display of anger towards the beloved. It's as if the heart is putting on a performance, displaying anger when in reality it craves the beloved's company. This could be an emotional defense mechanism, where the heart, in anticipation of the pain of eventual separation, tries to distance itself from the beloved.\n\nThis verse thus captures the complex dynamics of love, where passion and anger, longing and avoidance, often coexist. It portrays the inner turmoil experienced by lovers, where the heart's true desires are often masked by outward displays of resentment or anger. It's a beautifully poignant representation of the irrational yet intensely emotional nature of love..The kural verse:காமம் விடுஒன்றோ நாண்விடு நன்னெஞ்சேயானோ பொறேன்இவ் விரண்டு. ,translates to :Off with love O mind, or shame I cannot endure both of them,and it's explantion is :Kural 1247 is a profound verse that speaks to the internal conflict experienced by many individuals when they are caught between the desires of the heart and the principles of honor. \n\nIn this verse, the poet addresses his own soul, pleading it to make a choice between lust and honor. Lust here refers to desires that are often seen as base or unrefined, while honor signifies the moral high ground, the adherence to principles and ethics that society values. \n\nThe poet is essentially saying that he is unable to bear the weight of both at the same time, as they often pull him in opposite directions. He beseeches his soul to relinquish one or the other because the strain of trying to balance both is too much for him to bear. This is an acknowledgment of the human struggle to reconcile personal desires with societal expectations and norms, a conflict that is as valid today as it was when this verse was penned.\n\nThe verse subtly advocates for clarity in one's life and decisions. It underlines the need for an individual to understand their own capacity to deal with contrasting emotions and situations - the pulls of desire and the pushes of honor. It calls for a clear alignment of one's actions either with personal desire or with societal norms, as trying to straddle both could lead to internal turmoil and distress..The kural verse:பரிந்தவர் நல்காரென்று ஏங்கிப் பிரிந்தவர்பின்செல்வாய் பேதைஎன் நெஞ்சு. ,translates to :Without pity he would depart! You sigh and seek his favour, poor heart!,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 1248, expresses the distress and self-reproach of a lovelorn heart. The poet refers to his own heart as a 'fool' for pursuing someone who has left and shown no kindness or affection in return. \n\nIn this context, the 'departed one' symbolizes a person who has emotionally distanced themselves or ended a relationship. Despite the pain of separation and the clear indifference from this person, the poet's heart continues to yearn and follow in their wake. This behavior, the poet laments, is foolish and devoid of wisdom.\n\nThe verse reflects a universal human emotion - unrequited love. It tells us about the irrationality often associated with love, where the heart continues to hope and long for someone who does not reciprocate the feelings. It is a poignant reminder of the deep emotional turmoil one can undergo in the face of unreturned affection.\n\nThe verse also subtly underscores the importance of self-respect and wisdom in matters of the heart. It urges us to recognize when love is not reciprocated and to have the strength to move on rather than persist in a futile pursuit..The kural verse:உள்ளத்தார் காத லவரால் உள்ளிநீயாருழைச் சேறியென் நெஞ்சு. ,translates to :The lover lives in Self you know; Whom you think, mind to whom you go?,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural is a profound reflection on love and the inner life of the heart. Here, the poet is engaging in a dialogue with his own heart, questioning his restlessness when the object of his affection resides within him.\n\nThe verse highlights the introspective nature of deep love. When one is truly in love, the beloved becomes a part of oneself, inhabiting the innermost recesses of one's heart and mind. Thus, the poet questions his heart, \"O my soul! to whom would you repair, while the dear one is within yourself?\"\n\nThis implies that the physical absence of the beloved does not cause the heart to yearn, for the beloved is never truly absent from the lover. The beloved is always there, inside the heart of the lover. The poet admonishes his soul for seeking outwardly when the one it seeks is already within it.\n\nThis verse underlines the transcendental nature of love. It transcends physical boundaries and resides within the spiritual realm. Thus, the searching, yearning heart need not wander outwardly, for what it seeks resides within. This is a timeless message that resonates with all who have experienced deep, enduring love.\n\nIn the cultural context, this kural reflects a deeply philosophical and spiritual approach to love, a theme recurrent in many ancient Tamil works. It emphasizes the idea that love is not merely a physical or external experience but a deeply internal and spiritual one..The kural verse:துன்னாத் துறந்தாரை நெஞ்சத்து உடையேமாஇன்னும் இழத்தும் கவின். ,translates to :Without a thought he deserted us To think of him will make us worse,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural alludes to the detrimental effects of clinging onto past relationships and not moving forward. The poet implies that when someone leaves our life without wanting to maintain a connection, it is not healthy or productive to keep them in our thoughts and hearts. \n\nThe verse warns that such obsession and inability to let go can lead to a severe loss of one's inner beauty. Here, the 'inner beauty' represents mental peace, happiness, and the ability to love and live life fully. The poet suggests that by dwelling on a person who has left us, we risk losing these precious qualities.\n\nThe cultural context of this verse is rooted in the ancient Tamil wisdom about emotional well-being and personal growth. It emphasizes the importance of emotional resilience and the ability to move on from past hurts in order to maintain one's inner peace and beauty.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can also be interpreted as a moral lesson about attachment and detachment. It teaches us the importance of letting go of things that are no longer part of our lives and focusing on the present for maintaining our inner integrity and emotional well-being..The kural verse:காமக் கணிச்சி உடைக்கும் நிறையென்னும்நாணுத்தாழ் வீழ்த்த கதவு. ,translates to :Passion's axe shall break the door Of reserve bolted with my honour,and it's explantion is :Kural 1251 is a metaphorical verse that describes the power of desire and its potential to break down personal barriers of modesty and chastity. \n\nThe verse employs the metaphor of an axe (representing lust or desire) that can break open a door (representing the personal barriers of modesty and chastity). The bolt on the door represents the strength of one's modesty, which is expected to keep desire in check. \n\nHowever, when the force of desire becomes too strong, it is capable of breaking through even the most fortified defenses. The verse cautions against the destructive power of uncontrolled desire, and underscores the importance of maintaining personal boundaries of modesty and chastity.\n\nThis verse is a profound reminder of the need for self-control and discipline in matters of desire, as lack of restraint can lead to the breakdown of personal values and reputation. In many cultures, including Tamil, modesty and chastity are highly valued virtues, and this verse emphasizes the need to guard them against the overpowering force of desire. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can also be interpreted as a warning against letting any form of desire or passion overpower one's better judgement or moral values..The kural verse:காமம் எனவொன்றோ கண்ணின்றென் நெஞ்சத்தையாமத்தும் ஆளும் தொழில். ,translates to :The thing called lust is a heartless power It sways my mind at midnight hour,and it's explantion is :Kural 1252 delves into the powerful and all-consuming nature of desire or lust. The poet laments that this strong emotion, referred to as 'kamam', is relentless and merciless. It doesn't let his heart rest even during the quietest hours of the night, constantly stirring emotions and thoughts that disrupt his peace.\n\nThis verse emphasizes the magnitude of passion that can take over one's mind and thoughts completely. The poet uses the imagery of the midnight hour, a time typically associated with rest and tranquility, to illustrate how lust intrudes and causes unrest, showcasing its unyielding nature. \n\nThe cultural context here is that lust is often viewed as a powerful emotion that can dominate one's thoughts and actions if not controlled. This kural serves as a metaphorical reminder of the need for self-control and the potential turmoil that unregulated passions can cause.\n\nThe moral interpretation of this kural is about understanding the strength of our emotions and the need to regulate them. It's a call for self-discipline, control and balance in our emotional responses..The kural verse:மறைப்பேன்மன் காமத்தை யானோ குறிப்பின்றித்தும்மல்போல் தோன்றி விடும். ,translates to :How to hide this lust which shows Itself while I sneeze unawares!,and it's explantion is :Kural 1253 is a poignant verse that delves into the overpowering nature of love and its influence on self-control. The poet expresses his intention to conceal his feelings of love, reflecting his desire to maintain self-restraint. However, he admits that, much like an uncontrollable sneeze, his love refuses to be suppressed and involuntarily reveals itself.\n\nThe comparison of the involuntary nature of a sneeze to the spontaneous expression of love is a beautiful depiction of how emotions, particularly love, can overrule our conscious intentions. It highlights how even the strongest willpower can sometimes fail in the face of overpowering emotions, indicating the profound impact of love on human behavior and decision-making.\n\nThe verse suggests that love is not a feeling that can be easily controlled or hidden. When it takes hold, it demands to be acknowledged and expressed, often in ways that are as surprising and uncontrollable as a sudden sneeze. This metaphor not only adds a touch of humor but also underscores the involuntary, powerful, and universal nature of love. \n\nIn a broader sense, the Kural teaches us about the inevitability of our emotions and the importance of accepting and expressing them honestly, instead of trying to suppress or hide them. It encourages us to accept love as a natural and integral part of our lives..The kural verse:நிறையுடையேன் என்பேன்மன் யானோஎன் காமம்மறையிறந்து மன்று படும். ,translates to :I was proud of my sex-reserve Lo lust betrays what I preserve,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural talks about the overpowering nature of love and how it can disrupt one's self-control. \n\nThe speaker in the verse confesses that they thought they were strong and firm, able to control their emotions and feelings. However, their love, which they describe as a \"malady\" or an affliction, manages to break through this self-imposed concealment and reveal itself openly in public. This can be seen as an expression of the speaker's inability to control their feelings of love, and how those feelings have become so strong that they cannot be hidden anymore.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the power of love and how it can overwhelm even the most resolute individuals. It suggests that love is a force that cannot be easily controlled or hidden, and will eventually reveal itself, regardless of one's efforts to suppress it.\n\nThe cultural context of this verse also indicates the societal norms and expectations of the time when the Thirukkural was written. Public displays of affection were likely frowned upon, leading to the speaker's distress at their feelings being revealed in public.\n\nIn summary, this verse is a poignant exploration of the struggle between self-control and the overwhelming force of love, demonstrating the emotional turmoil that can result from this conflict..The kural verse:செற்றார்பின் செல்லாப் பெருந்தகைமை காமநோய்உற்றார் அறிவதொன்று அன்று. ,translates to :Dignity seeks not a deserter But Love-sick is its innovator,and it's explantion is :Kural 1255 explores the complex emotions associated with love, particularly unrequited love. It suggests that those who are deeply in love lack the ability to maintain their dignity and self-respect when their beloved has departed or distanced themselves. \n\nThe verse metaphorically describes the desperation and longing that often accompany intense love, leading individuals to forsake their pride and dignity in an attempt to keep the connection alive. \n\nThe \"dignity that would not go after an absent lover\" refers to the strength of character and self-respect that enables one to accept the other's departure without pursuing them obsessively. However, this kind of self-restraint is absent in those who are profoundly 'sticken by love,' as their overwhelming emotions overshadow their self-respect and rational thinking.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, through this Kural, is commenting on the powerful and sometimes destructive force of love that can cause individuals to lose sight of their self-worth and dignity. He signifies that love, in its intense form, can cloud judgement and deter one from maintaining their self-respect and dignity. \n\nHowever, it is vital to note that this Kural does not devalue love itself, but rather points out the potential pitfalls of an uncontrolled and unrequited love that lacks balance and respect for one's own self..The kural verse:செற்றவர் பின்சேறல் வேண்டி அளித்தரோஎற்றென்னை உற்ற துயர். ,translates to :O Grief, my deserter you seek Of your caprice what shall I speak!,and it's explantion is :The verse, Kural 1256, talks about the deep pain and sorrow experienced by the longing heart that yearns to follow and reunite with a beloved who has departed or separated. The protagonist questions the value or worth of such a heartache. \n\nIn the context of love and separation, this verse highlights the profound distress that accompanies longing for a departed lover. The lover is not merely missed, but the protagonist feels a compelling urge to follow them, despite the separation. This intense longing fuels a sorrow that is so deep and consuming, it prompts the protagonist to question its merit or purpose. \n\nIt acts as a commentary on human emotions, particularly the pain of separation in love. The verse underscores the agony that love can sometimes bring, in contrast to its often-romanticized joy and happiness. It also subtly hints at the irrationality of such an emotion, where one still pursues the source of their pain, seeking reunion and solace. \n\nThe verse, thus, serves as a reflection of the complexities of human emotions and the paradoxical nature of love, which can bring both immense joy and profound sorrow..The kural verse:நாணென ஒன்றோ அறியலம் காமத்தால்பேணியார் பெட்ப செயின். ,translates to :When lover's love does what it desires We forget all shame unawares,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural talks about the power of love and the emotional intensity it brings, causing one to lose awareness of their societal inhibitions and norms, especially when the person they love reciprocates their feelings in a desirable manner. \n\nThe verse asserts that when the beloved responds favorably to the lover's affection and does what the lover desires, the lover experiences such a state of bliss and contentment that they become oblivious to the concept of shame, a fundamental societal norm that often guides behavior. The lover is so engrossed in the experience of their beloved's mutual affection that they forget about societal expectations or conventions.\n\nIn essence, this kural illustrates the profound impact of love, which can make people lose their sense of societal norms and inhibitions in favor of their feelings and desires. It's a testament to the power and depth of genuine affection and mutual love. It also subtly implies that love, in its purest form, is beyond societal norms and judgments, and is a deeply personal and transformative experience..The kural verse:பன்மாயக் கள்வன் பணிமொழி அன்றோநம்பெண்மை உடைக்கும் படை. ,translates to :The cheater of many wily arts His tempting words break through women's hearts,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural is a profound reflection on the nature of love and the influence it can wield on a person's individuality and resolve. Here, the female speaker laments how her lover's deceiving and alluring words, filled with false promises, act as a weapon that shatters her feminine integrity and self-control.\n\nThe reference to the lover as a \"trick-abounding roguish\" person indicates the manipulative tactics he uses to win her over. His words are so compelling that they manage to break her firmness, which is metaphorically referred to as a fort or stronghold. This metaphor signifies the strength of a woman's resolve and her firmness of character, which is being compromised due to the lover's deceitful words.\n\nThe verse thus serves as a critique of manipulative love and the power dynamics in a relationship. It emphasizes the need for honesty and respect in love, cautioning against losing one's self-worth and integrity under the guise of love. It also subtly highlights the strength and resilience of women and their ability to recognize and resist such manipulative tactics..The kural verse:புலப்பல் எனச்சென்றேன் புல்லினேன் நெஞ்சம்கலத்தல் உறுவது கண்டு. ,translates to :In huff I went and felt at ease Heat to heart in sweet embrace,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural depicts an emotional conflict in the mind of a lover. It portrays the struggle between the conscious intention to feign indifference and the deep-seated, uncontrollable affection for the loved one.\n\nThe speaker in the verse initially decides to pretend dislike towards the beloved, with the intention to withdraw and thereby display a sense of detachment. This could be due to a myriad of reasons such as wanting to test the depth of the other person's love, or as an emotional reaction to some misunderstanding or hurt.\n\nHowever, the moment the speaker encounters the beloved, the true feelings gush forth, overwhelming the artificial façade of detachment. The heart begins to 'unite' with the beloved, symbolizing an overwhelming wave of affection and longing that the speaker couldn't resist. In the end, the speaker gives in to these irresistible feelings and embraces the beloved, completely forgetting the original intent of feigned indifference.\n\nThis verse beautifully captures the power and unpredictability of human emotions, especially love. It also highlights the struggle between the mind's conscious decisions and the heart's uncontrollable feelings. This timeless message resonates with any individual who has experienced the complexities of love and affection..The kural verse:நிணந்தீயில் இட்டன்ன நெஞ்சினார்க்கு உண்டோபுணர்ந்தூடி நிற்பேம் எனல். ,translates to :To feign dislike is it not rare  For mates who melt like fat in fire?,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural discusses the overwhelming power of love and the inability to feign indifference or dislike when one is truly in love. The poet uses a powerful metaphor, likening the heart in love to fat melting in the fire. Just as fat cannot resist melting when exposed to heat, a heart deeply in love cannot resist melting at the sight or thought of the beloved. Consequently, it becomes impossible for such a person to pretend that they are indifferent or unaffected. \n\nThe verse underscores the compelling nature of love that overrides all attempts at pretense or denial. It suggests that true affection cannot be hidden or suppressed and will reveal itself, much like how fat inevitably melts when exposed to fire. The verse highlights the authenticity and profoundness of such love, which cannot be masked or feigned, no matter how much one might try. \n\nMoreover, the verse also subtly underscores the vulnerability and openness that come with such deep affection, as it leaves the lover exposed, much like the melting fat. Despite this vulnerability, the verse implies that this openness and authenticity are integral to profound love, and any attempts to feign indifference or dislike would be futile and unnatural. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can be interpreted as a commentary on the futility of dissembling in any deep emotional connection, not just romantic love. It suggests that genuine emotions cannot be hidden or feigned and will inevitably reveal themselves..The kural verse:வாளற்றுப் புற்கென்ற கண்ணும் அவர்சென்றநாளொற்றித் தேய்ந்த விரல். ,translates to :My eyes are dim lustre-bereft Worn fingers count days since he left,and it's explantion is :Kural 1261 is a poignant expression of longing and separation. The verse speaks of the deep pain experienced by the poet due to the absence of their beloved. \n\nThe verse metaphorically describes how the poet's eyes have lost their lustre from constantly looking out for the return of their loved one. This signifies the depth of their despair and longing. The constant vigil has led to such fatigue and sadness that the eyes, usually the symbol of beauty and brightness, have become dull and lifeless.\n\nAdditionally, the verse also talks about marking the days of separation on the wall, an act which has worn away the poet's finger. This is an incredibly symbolic description of the weight of each day of separation, showing how time can become a source of pain in the absence of the beloved. \n\nThe verse highlights the physical toll that emotional pain can take, employing vivid imagery to convey the profound sorrow of separation. It underscores how love and separation are intertwined, and how the absence of a loved one can lead to a deep sense of loss and longing. \n\nOverall, Kural 1261 offers a touching depiction of love's anguish and the harsh reality of separation, providing a profound insight into the human condition and the profound impact of love on our lives..The kural verse:இலங்கிழாய் இன்று மறப்பின்என் தோள்மேல்கலங்கழியும் காரிகை நீத்து. ,translates to :Beauty pales and my bracelets slide; Why not forget him now, bright maid?,and it's explantion is :This verse is an eloquent expression of deep love and longing. The maiden addresses her friend, evoking the imagery of her adorned shoulders and bracelets. She says that if she were to forget her beloved even for a day, her beauty would diminish, causing her bracelets to loosen and fall off her shoulders.\n\nThe 'shoulders' and 'bracelets' in this verse are metaphors. The shoulders represent strength and resilience, often associated with the ability to bear burdens and responsibilities. In the context of this verse, they symbolize the maiden's emotional strength and her ability to bear the pain of separation from her beloved. The bracelets, being adornments, symbolize beauty and attractiveness. \n\nBy saying that her shoulders would lose their beauty and her bracelets would loosen, the maiden implies that forgetting her beloved would result in a loss of her emotional strength and beauty. This could be interpreted as a moral assertion that true love and commitment should not be forgotten or abandoned, even in times of difficulty or separation.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase \"even in the other life\" indicates the belief in reincarnation, a common concept in Indian philosophical and spiritual traditions. This suggests the depth of her love - a love so strong that it transcends the boundaries of life and death.\n\nIn conclusion, this verse is a poignant expression of the profound impact of love and separation on one's psyche, using evocative imagery and metaphors. It underscores the ideals of dedication, commitment, and the enduring nature of true love..The kural verse:உரன்நசைஇ உள்ளம் துணையாகச் சென்றார்வரல்நசைஇ இன்னும் உளேன். ,translates to :Will as guide he went to win Yet I live-to see him again,and it's explantion is :Kural 1263 speaks of love, longing, and hope. The verse describes the emotions of a person who waits in anticipation for the return of their beloved. This beloved has set out on a journey, driven by a desire for victory and guided by valour. This suggests a scenario where the lover has gone off to fight a war or undertake some significant mission.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the longing and hope that sustains the person left behind. Despite the absence of the beloved, the person continues to live, fuelled by the hope of their return. The phrase \"I still live by longing for the arrival\" beautifully captures this sentiment of hopeful anticipation.\n\nThis verse highlights the power of love and hope. It shows how love can give us strength and purpose, even in times of separation and uncertainty. It speaks to the human capacity to endure hardship and wait patiently, fueled by love and hope for a better future. \n\nMoreover, this verse also hints at the cultural context of ancient Tamil society, where bravery and victory were highly valued. The lover's departure in pursuit of victory suggests a heroic undertone, reflecting the societal expectations of the time. \n\nIn summary, Kural 1263 is a poignant exploration of love, longing, hope, and the human spirit's resilience. It shows how love can sustain us in times of separation and uncertainty, and how hope for a loved one's return can give us the strength to carry on..The kural verse:கூடிய காமம் பிரிந்தார் வரவுள்ளிக்கோடுகொ டேறுமென் நெஞ்சு. ,translates to :My heart in rapture heaves to see His retun with love to embrace me,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural speaks about the profound longing and anticipation experienced by a lover yearning for their beloved's return. The author uses the metaphor of a heart swelling with joy, much like a tree branch reaching for the sky, to underline the immense happiness that the thought of their lover's return brings.\n\nThe verse captures the essence of love - the separation, the longing, and the anticipation of reunion. It talks about how the lover, who once shared an intimate relationship, has now departed, leaving the speaker in a state of longing. Yet, it is the thought of their beloved returning, presumably with the same affection, that lifts the speaker's spirits. Their heart is no longer burdened with sorrow but swells with joy, similar to how a tree branch grows higher, reaching out to the sky.\n\nThis verse is a beautiful depiction of the emotional highs and lows experienced in love. It outlines the pain of separation but also the joy of reunion, emphasizing the power of love to uplift spirits even in periods of separation. The underlying moral is that love, despite its challenges, has the power to bring immense joy and anticipation, enough to overcome the sorrow of separation..The kural verse:காண்கமன் கொண்கனைக் கண்ணாரக் கண்டபின்நீங்கும்என் மென்தோள் பசப்பு. ,translates to :Let me but gaze and gaze my spouse sallow on my soft shoulders files,and it's explantion is :The kural 1265 is a passionate expression of a woman's longing to see her beloved. The verse, in a figurative language, explores the transformative power of love and the anticipation of union.\n\nThe woman yearns to see her lover until her eyes are satiated. Her intense desire is so profound that she believes the sight of her beloved can cure the sallowness, or the pallor, that has spread across her slender shoulders. The pallor here is a metaphorical depiction of the sadness and longing that has been caused by their separation. It also symbolizes the physical manifestations of her emotional state, perhaps due to lack of sleep, food, or general well-being, brought about by her separation from her lover.\n\nThe verse beautifully encapsulates the belief that her lover's presence will remedy her sorrowful state, bringing back the vibrancy and color to her life, as suggested by the disappearance of the 'sallowness' on her shoulders. This verse essentially expresses the healing and rejuvenating power of love.\n\nSo, this verse is an eloquent portrayal of the deep longing in love, the physical and emotional impact of separation, and the restorative power of the beloved's presence..The kural verse:வருகமன் கொண்கன் ஒருநாள் பருகுவன்பைதல்நோய் எல்லாம் கெட. ,translates to :Let my spouse return just a day Joy-drink shall drive my pain away,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 1266, is a poignant expression of a woman's yearning for her absent husband. The verse beautifully encapsulates the depth of her love and the pain of her longing.\n\nThe verse is a heartfelt plea - \"May my husband return some day.\" She is not demanding his immediate return but expressing a hope, a desire, that he may return one day. This is a testament to her patience and her enduring love.\n\nThe second part of the verse, \"and then will I enjoy (him) so as to destroy all this agonizing sorrow\", speaks of her belief that his return will dissipate all her sorrow and pain. It signifies her conviction that the joy of being with him will be so profound that it will erase the agony of his absence. She is prepared to bask in the joy of his company and heal the wounds of separation.\n\nThe verse essentially represents a deep longing and an unwavering hope. It is a vivid portrayal of love, patience, and resilience in the face of separation. It is a testament to the power of love and the strength of hope, making it a timeless and universal expression of human emotions..The kural verse:புலப்பேன்கொல் புல்லுவேன் கொல்லோ கலப்பேன்கொல்கண்அன்ன கேளிர் விரன். ,translates to :If my eye-like lord returneth Shall I sulk or clasp or do both?,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural depicts the emotional turmoil experienced by a lover upon the return of their beloved after a long separation. The lover is torn between conflicting emotions - anger due to the prolonged separation, and joy in seeing their beloved return.\n\nThe verse essentially captures the complexity of human emotions, particularly during a reunion after a period of absence. It highlights how individuals can simultaneously feel resentment and love, anger, and joy. The reference to the beloved as dear as the speaker's eyes signifies the depth of their love and the importance of their beloved in their life.\n\nThis verse also emphasizes the unpredictability and complexity of human responses to emotional situations. Even though the speaker wishes to express their displeasure at their beloved's absence, the joy of their return overcomes this feeling. Similarly, the desire to embrace their beloved shows the longing and the depth of affection the speaker has for their beloved.\n\nIn the end, the verse leaves the question open-ended, suggesting that the speaker might both show their displeasure and embrace their beloved, demonstrating the complex and multifaceted nature of human emotions, especially in romantic relationships. This verse resonates with anyone who has experienced a similar emotional conflict in their personal relationships, making it a timeless reflection on love and human emotions..The kural verse:வினைகலந்து வென்றீக வேந்தன் மனைகலந்துமாலை அயர்கம் விருந்து. ,translates to :May the king fight and win and give And with my wife I will feast this eve!,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural, Kural 1268, presents an intriguing juxtaposition of a king's duties and the simple pleasures of a common man's life.\n\nThe verse speaks of two different paths of life. The first path is that of the king or ruler, whose duty it is to engage in conflicts and battles to protect and expand his kingdom. This path requires courage, strategic thinking, and a willingness to risk one's life for the greater good. Victory in this context is not just a personal triumph, but also brings prosperity and security to the kingdom and its subjects.\n\nThe second path is that of the common man, who finds joy in the simple and intimate moments of life. The verse emphasizes the man's preference to spend his evenings in the company of his wife, enjoying a meal together. This is a symbol of domestic bliss and contentment, a stark contrast to the tumultuous life of a king.\n\nThe verse, therefore, is a commentary on the different roles individuals play in society and the varying definitions of success and happiness. For the king, success is measured by victories and conquests. For the common man, it is the peace and pleasure derived from a simple life spent with loved ones. It underscores the idea that happiness and fulfillment come in different forms and are deeply personal and subjective..The kural verse:ஒருநாள் எழுநாள்போல் செல்லும்சேண் சென்றார்வருநாள்வைத்து ஏங்கு பவர்க்கு. ,translates to :One day seems as seven to those Who yearn return of distant spouse,and it's explantion is :Kural 1269 is a poignant articulation of the concept of longing and the subjective nature of time in the context of love. It portrays the emotional turmoil of those who are separated from their beloved and are eagerly waiting for their return.\n\nThe verse asserts, \"To those who suffer waiting for the day of return of their distant lovers, one day is as long as seven days.\" Here, Valluvar uses time as a measure of emotional experience. When a person is separated from their loved one, each passing day feels disproportionately longer due to their intense longing and anticipation. This is an embodiment of the phrase \"absence makes the heart grow fonder\", where the physical distance amplifies the emotional connection and longing.\n\nThe verse underscores the deep emotional attachment in love, the pain of separation, and the longing for reunion. It resonates with the universal human experience of waiting and longing for a loved one's return, making it relatable across cultures and ages. \n\nThis Kural is a testament to Valluvar's profound understanding of human emotions and his ability to convey complex feelings in simple, yet powerful language. It is a reminder of the depth and intensity of love, and the poignant beauty of longing..The kural verse:பெறின்என்னாம் பெற்றக்கால் என்னாம் உறினென்னாம்உள்ளம் உடைந்துக்கக் கால். ,translates to :When her heart is broken, what is The good of meeting and love-embrace?,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural speaks about the pain of separation and the eventual futility of reunion after the emotional damage has been done. The poet is expressing his anguish over the thought of his beloved's heartbreak due to their separation. He questions the value of reuniting after her heart has been broken, as any subsequent meeting or embrace would be meaningless.\n\nThe verse explores the profound emotional connection between two people and emphasizes the importance of emotional well-being in a relationship. The loss of love is likened to heartbreak, symbolizing the deep emotional trauma that can occur due to separation, and how it can potentially lead to the destruction of one's spirit.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse can be interpreted as a reflection on the consequences of our actions. It serves as a reminder that actions taken without considering the emotional impact on others can lead to irreparable damage, making any later attempts at reconciliation meaningless.\n\nThe Kural thus imparts a moral lesson on the importance of empathy and emotional consideration in our interactions with others. It highlights the fact that emotional pain can be as devastating as physical harm, and that nurturing the emotional well-being of our loved ones is crucial in maintaining healthy relationships..The kural verse:கரப்பினுங் கையிகந் தொல்லாநின் உண்கண்உரைக்கல் உறுவதொன் றுண்டு. ,translates to :You hide; but your painted eyes Restraint off, report your surmise,and it's explantion is :Kural 1271 is a beautiful verse that explores the concept of non-verbal communication, particularly in the context of romantic relationships. \n\nThe verse suggests that even when we try to hide our feelings, our eyes might betray us. They tend to express what our lips are hesitant to articulate. This is a universal truth, applicable across cultures and eras, asserting that emotions are difficult to hide, especially love. \n\nThe eyes, often referred to as windows to the soul, can reveal a multitude of emotions - happiness, sorrow, fear, surprise, and in this case, love. Even if one tries to conceal their feelings, the eyes, like a mirror, reflect the truth. \n\nIn the cultural context, the reference to 'painted eyes' might be alluding to the practice of using kohl or eyeliner, common in ancient Tamil culture, to enhance the beauty of the eyes. It adds a layer of aesthetic charm to the verse while maintaining the depth of its meaning. \n\nIn essence, Kural 1271 highlights the power and expressiveness of the eyes in conveying emotions, especially those that we try to hide.\n.The kural verse:கண்ணிறைந்த காரிகைக் காம்பேர்தோட் பேதைக்குப்பெண்நிறைந்த நீர்மை பெரிது. ,translates to :With seemly grace and stem-like arms The simple she has ample charms,and it's explantion is :This couplet (Kural 1272), penned by the legendary Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar, belongs to the chapter on love and admiration in the classic Thiru Kural. It extols the beauty and virtue of a woman through the eyes of her admirer.\n\nIn the verse, the poet compares the woman's beauty and elegance to that of a bamboo stick, which is known for its grace, flexibility, and resilience. The beauty that fills his eyes symbolizes her physical attractiveness, while the bamboo-like shoulders represent her strength and resilience. \n\nHowever, the poet emphasizes that the most admirable quality of this woman isn't her physical charm but her virtue of \"female simplicity\" or \"feminine grace\". This term refers to the inherent qualities associated with womanhood, including modesty, gentleness, compassion, nurturing spirit, and patience. \n\nThiruvalluvar suggests that this woman's virtue of feminine grace is \"unusually great\", indicating that she surpasses the ordinary standards of womanhood. Her inner beauty, portrayed by her virtues, makes her more attractive and alluring than her physical beauty.\n\nThe essence of this verse lies in its message about the importance of virtues and character over physical beauty. While physical attractiveness may initially draw attention, it is the inner qualities that make a person truly beautiful and admirable. This timeless wisdom remains relevant even today..The kural verse:மணியில் திகழ்தரு நூல்போல் மடந்தைஅணியில் திகழ்வதொன்று உண்டு. ,translates to :Something shines through her jewelled charm Like thread shining through wreathed gem,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1273 is a beautiful verse that uses an analogy to express the alluring charm of a woman. The verse reads:\n\n\"There is something that is implied in the beauty of this woman, like the thread that is visible in a garland of gems.\"\n\nIn this verse, Valluvar uses the metaphor of a string of gemstones to illustrate the captivating beauty of a woman. Just as a thread that holds the gems together in a necklace is subtly visible, there is an underlying charm in a woman's beauty that is subtly present, yet profoundly felt. It might not be conspicuously visible, but it is what binds the entire charm together, making it impossible to ignore.\n\nThe verse beautifully captures the subtle nuances of attraction, implying that the allure of a woman is not just in her physical beauty, but in the subtle qualities that enhance her charm. This could refer to her grace, demeanor, character, or any other attribute that adds to her overall appeal. Much like how the strength of a necklace lies in its unseen thread, the true beauty of a woman lies in these hidden qualities. This is the essence of the verse, which emphasizes a deeper and more nuanced understanding of beauty and allure..The kural verse:முகைமொக்குள் உள்ளது நாற்றம்போல் பேதைநகைமொக்குள் உள்ளதொன் றுண்டு. ,translates to :Like scent in bud secrets conceal In the bosom of her half smile,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural uses a beautiful analogy to express a girl's budding love for her beloved. It compares the hidden emotions in a girl's shy smile to the fragrance contained within an unopened bud. \n\nJust as the bud holds a unique fragrance within, waiting for the right moment to bloom and disperse its scent, the girl's smile subtly holds the expression of her feelings for her beloved. Despite being veiled, these feelings are real and profound, just like the fragrance in the bud, which is invisible yet undeniably present.\n\nThis verse is a sensitive portrayal of young love, and highlights the poetic beauty in the subtlety of emotions and expressions. It also emphasizes the depth and authenticity of feelings, which may not always be displayed openly, but are nonetheless deeply felt and treasured. The comparison with nature also draws a parallel between human emotions and natural phenomena, suggesting that just like nature, human feelings too, have their own rhythm and timing..The kural verse:செறிதொடி செய்திறந்த கள்ளம் உறுதுயர்தீர்க்கும் மருந்தொன்று உடைத்து. ,translates to :The close-bangled belle's hidden thought Has a cure for my troubled heart She to Her Maid,and it's explantion is :Kural 1275 is a verse that dips into the emotional complexities of love and separation. The verse essentially presents the notion that within the sorrow of parting, there lies a hidden remedy that eases the pain. \n\nHere, the poet refers to his beloved, describing her as \"her whose bangles are tight-fitting,\" a traditional symbol of a woman's beauty and elegance in Tamil culture. The \"well-meant departure\" refers to the painful yet necessary act of saying goodbye, often intertwined with hints of affection and mutual respect.\n\nThe poet finds solace and healing in the subtle signs of affection conveyed in her departure. While it might be a sorrowful goodbye, the hidden gestures or the \"cure\" might be in the form of an affectionate glance, a soft touch, or a word of endearment, alluding to the hope of reunion. These details, while seemingly insignificant, hold the power to alleviate the lover's profound distress.\n\nThis verse encourages us to find the silver lining amidst painful situations and to understand that even in despair, there can be elements of hope and solace. It speaks about the depth of love and the strength it provides to withstand the pain of separation..The kural verse:பெரிதாற்றிப் பெட்பக் கலத்தல் அரிதாற்றிஅன்பின்மை சூழ்வ துடைத்து. ,translates to :His over-kind close embrace sooths; But makes me feel, loveless, he parts,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse speaks about the profound power of affectionate embrace. It states that an embrace filled with love can alleviate past sorrows and can make one reflect on the absence of love in the past. It suggests that the act of coming together with deep affection, after a painful period of separation, is so fulfilling and comforting that it makes one contemplate the pain of the previous lack of love.\n\nEssentially, it means that the joy and comfort of being reunited with a loved one, after enduring the hardship of their absence, is so powerful that it not only erases the pain of the past but also makes us reflect on the period when the love was absent. It highlights the importance of love and affection, and how the presence or absence of it can profoundly affect our emotional state.\n\nThis verse gives us an insight into the depth of human emotions and the healing power of love. It emphasizes that love is an essential element in our lives, capable of healing our past wounds and filling us with joy and contentment..The kural verse:தண்ணந் துறைவன் தணந்தமை நம்மினும்முன்னம் உணர்ந்த வளை. ,translates to :Quick, my bracelets read before The mind of my lord of cool shore,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural is a poignant expression of a lover's anguish due to an emotional distance that has come between her and her beloved, even when they are physically close. The beloved is referred to as the 'ruler of the cool seashore', a metaphorical description that highlights his charm and attractiveness. \n\nThe verse speaks about the woman's bangles, which symbolize her emotional state. The bangles, once snug around her wrist due to her contentment in love, have now become loose, indicating her mental distress. This physical change in the bangles is noticed even before she consciously acknowledges the emotional separation from her beloved. Thus, her ornaments seem to have sensed her inner turmoil even before she herself did.\n\nThis verse is a beautiful commentary on the physical manifestations of emotional changes and the poignant reality of unspoken feelings in a relationship. As with many of Thirukkural's verses, it emphasizes the profound connections between our emotional, physical, and material worlds..The kural verse:நெருநற்றுச் சென்றார்எம் காதலர் யாமும்எழுநாளேம் மேனி பசந்து. ,translates to :My lover parted but yesterday; With sallowness it is seventh day The Maid Tells Him,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1278 beautifully captures the depth of the protagonist's love and the pain of separation. The verse says, \"It was but yesterday my lover departed (from me); and it is seven days since my complexion turned sallow.\" \n\nThis verse employs a metaphorical expression to convey the intensity of the emotional turmoil experienced by the protagonist. It signifies that the protagonist's lover has just left, but the pain and longing caused by the separation are so intense that it feels as if it has been seven days. The change of complexion to a sallow, unhealthy color symbolizes the deep-seated emotional distress and the physical toll it takes on the individual.\n\nThe verse underscores the profound connection between emotional well-being and physical health. It also highlights the time distortion commonly experienced during periods of intense emotional distress, where a single day of separation can feel like an excruciatingly long week.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse points to the universal human experience of love and loss, and the deep emotional impact that separation from a loved one can have. It is a poignant reminder of the power of love and the depth of emotions it can stir in the human heart..The kural verse:தொடிநோக்கி மென்தோளும் நோக்கி அடிநோக்கிஅஃதாண் டவள்செய் தது. ,translates to :She views her armlets, her tender arms And then her feet; these are her norms,and it's explantion is :Kural 1279 is a beautiful verse that captures a woman's silent communication of her love and longing for her beloved. The verse describes a woman who, in the absence of her lover, looks at her bracelets, her tender shoulders, and her feet. This seemingly simple action is laden with deep emotional significance.\n\nThe reference to the bracelets symbolizes the bond of love and companionship that she shares with her lover. Looking at them could mean that she is contemplating the depth of their relationship and the emptiness she feels in his absence.\n\nHer gaze then shifts to her tender shoulders, possibly symbolizing her vulnerability and her need for the comforting presence of her lover. The tender shoulders could also signify the shared burdens and responsibilities in their relationship, which she now has to bear alone.\n\nFinally, she looks at her feet, which could be a metaphor for her readiness and willingness to follow her lover wherever he goes. It could also mean that she is contemplating her journey in life, which she wishes to embark on only with her beloved.\n\nOverall, through the non-verbal cues and subtle hints, she silently communicates her longing for her partner. Her actions are not just a reflection of her physical solitude, but also her emotional state of yearning for her lover's companionship. This verse is a poignant commentary on the depth of love and longing, expressed through the quiet language of silence..The kural verse:பெண்ணினால் பெண்மை உடைத்தென்ப கண்ணினால்காமநோய் சொல்லி இரவு. ,translates to :To express love-pangs by eyes and pray Is womanhood's womanly way,and it's explantion is :Kural 1280 emphasizes the virtue of a woman expressing her feelings of love subtly and with dignity. The verse says that a woman's ability to subtly communicate her feelings of love through her eyes, without verbally expressing it, and yet refrain from chasing after her beloved, adds an extraordinary dimension to her femininity.\n\nThe cultural context here is important as it reflects the traditional values of Tamil society, where overt expressions of love, especially by women, were not encouraged. Women were expected to maintain a certain decorum and express their feelings within these bounds. Expressing emotions subtly through their eyes was considered a noble art and was highly appreciated. This Kural does not just talk about physical restraint but also emotional control, which was considered a sign of strength and character in a woman.\n\nAdditionally, the verse also highlights the moral value of self-respect and dignity. Even in the throes of love, the woman is expected to maintain her dignity and respectability, not resorting to overt expressions or begging her beloved for reciprocation. This restraint and dignity in love are portrayed as enhancing the woman's inner beauty and grace, thus adding a unique dimension to her femininity. \n\nHence, this Thiru Kural verse is a comment on the nuanced expression of love, the cultural norms surrounding it, and the moral virtue of maintaining dignity in love, which are all considered to add to a woman's femininity..The kural verse:உள்ளக் களித்தலும் காண மகிழ்தலும்கள்ளுக்கில் காமத்திற் குண்டு. ,translates to :Rapture at thought and joy when seen Belong to love and not to wine,and it's explantion is :Kural 1281 delves into the profound emotion of love, comparing it to the fleeting pleasure of intoxication. The verse emphasizes the unique characteristics of love, stating that it has the power to elicit joy both through mere thought and the visual presence of the beloved, a delight that surpasses the temporary pleasure induced by liquor.\n\nThe verse begins with 'To please by thought and cheer by sight,' indicating the two-fold happiness that love brings. It signifies that the mere thought of the beloved can bring immense satisfaction and joy, an experience that does not require any physical consumption or presence. Similarly, witnessing the beloved's sight is enough to fill one with cheerfulness and delight. \n\nThe verse then contrasts this deeper, more profound emotion of love with the transient pleasure of intoxication caused by liquor. Liquor, though it can provide temporary ecstasy, lacks the capacity to offer the lasting happiness and satisfaction that love can impart. It is external, consumed, and its effects wear off, unlike love, which is internal, felt deeply, and its effects are long-lasting.\n\nIn essence, the Kural emphasizes that love is a potent inner emotion, capable of providing joy, both through thought and sight. It is a unique characteristic that is not found in fleeting, external pleasures like intoxication, underscoring the depth and significance of love in human life..The kural verse:தினைத்துணையும் ஊடாமை வேண்டும் பனைத்துணையும்காமம் நிறைய வரின். ,translates to :When passion grows palmyra-tall Sulking is wrong though millet-small,and it's explantion is :Kural 1282 emphasizes the importance of sincerity and honesty in expressing feelings, particularly in the context of a romantic relationship. The verse uses the metaphor of 'palmyra fruit' and 'millet' to depict the intensity of emotions. The 'palmyra fruit' is used as a symbol of large and overpowering emotions, specifically romantic passion or lust, while 'millet' represents the small, feigned expressions of dislike or modesty.\n\nThe verse advises that if a woman's romantic passion or lust is as overwhelming as a 'palmyra fruit', she should not feign dislike or modesty as insignificant as 'millet'. In essence, the verse encourages women to be authentic and straightforward in their feelings, and not to mask their true emotions with pretense or insincere expressions. \n\nThis advice, while rooted in the cultural context of ancient Tamil society, holds universal value. It emphasizes the importance of honesty and transparency in relationships, and discourages the playing of games or the use of manipulation. \n\nThe underlying moral lesson is the importance of being genuine in expressing one's feelings, as this leads to stronger and more meaningful relationships. This Kural suggests that when love or passion is strong, it should be expressed openly and without pretense, promoting a healthy and honest relationship..The kural verse:பேணாது பெட்பவே செய்யினும் கொண்கனைக்காணா தமையல கண். ,translates to :Though slighting me he acts his will My restless eyes would see him still,and it's explantion is :Kural 1283 is a beautiful expression of a devoted wife's longing for her husband. This verse is about the depth of her love and her yearning to see him.\n\nIn this Kural, the poetess describes her eyes as independent entities, which act on their own accord, disregarding her control. She says that even if her eyes perform actions that are pleasing to her husband, they would not be satisfied unless they see him.\n\nThis Kural underlines the importance of physical presence in a relationship. It portrays how the physical absence of a loved one can lead to restlessness and longing. Despite all the pleasing endeavors, the eyes crave for the sight of the loved one. This can be seen as a metaphor for the human heart that yearns for the presence of the beloved.\n\nIn the cultural context of ancient Tamil society, this Kural also reflects the deep bond and affection between a husband and wife. The wife's love for her husband is so intense that her eyes, metaphorically representing her heart and soul, are discontented when they cannot behold the sight of her husband.\n\nThis verse is a part of the 'Aga Inbam' or 'Intra-Marital Love' chapter in Thirukkural, which explores the emotional dynamics and complexities of married life. It is a testament to the depth of love and the sense of completeness that one's spouse can bring into one's life..The kural verse:ஊடற்கண் சென்றேன்மன் தோழி அதுமறந்துகூடற்கண் சென்றது என் னெஞ்சு. ,translates to :Huff I would, maid, but I forget; And leap to embrace him direct,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukural speaks about the overpowering nature of love and the deep emotional bond that love can create between two individuals. The poet expresses the complexity of love, where the heart behaves in ways that the mind may not initially intend.\n\nIn the verse, the narrator initially goes to meet their lover with the intention of arguing or expressing discontent (ஊடுவதற்காகச் சென்றேன்). This could be due to a disagreement, misunderstanding, or an action that caused hurt or disappointment. However, when they come face to face with their beloved, their heart forgets all the previous concerns or disagreements (அதை நெஞ்சம் மறந்து விட்டு). Instead, it is drawn irresistibly towards the beloved, yearning to be with them (அவரோடு கூடுவதற்கு இணங்கி விடுவதே).\n\nThe verse beautifully captures how love can dissolve resentment, soften anger, and promote togetherness, despite disagreements or misunderstandings. It emphasizes the power of love to overrule logical thought or planned actions, making the heart act in ways that might be unexpected for the mind. The verse essentially highlights the compelling and forgiving nature of love that makes one overlook flaws and disagreements, and yearn for unity and togetherness..The kural verse:எழுதுங்கால் கோல்காணாக் கண்ணேபோல் கொண்கன்பழிகாணேன் கண்ட இடத்து. ,translates to :When close I see not lord's blemish Like eyes that see not painter's brush,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thiru Kural by Thiruvalluvar speaks about the unconditional love and forgiveness a wife has for her husband. It compares her overlooking of his flaws to the inability of the eyes to see the pencil that is used to decorate them.\n\nThe eyes, while they can see everything around them, are unable to see the pencil that is used to beautify them. Similarly, when the wife sees her husband, even if she is aware of his flaws or mistakes, her affection for him makes her overlook and forget those shortcomings. This verse emphasizes the depth of her love, her capacity to forgive, and the way she chooses to focus only on his positive qualities when she is in his presence.\n\nThis verse also reflects the societal norms and cultural values of ancient Tamil society, where the wife's love, patience, and forgiveness were considered virtuous qualities. However, it also emphasizes the universal theme of love's ability to see beyond imperfections..The kural verse:காணுங்கால் காணேன் தவறாய காணாக்கால்காணேன் தவறல் லவை. ,translates to :When he's with me I see not fault And nought but fault when he is not,and it's explantion is :The verse 1286 of Thiru Kural discusses the profound love and affection a wife has for her husband. It beautifully captures her emotions, stating that when she sees her husband, she is so blinded by love that she overlooks any of his faults. His presence itself brings such joy and happiness that she chooses to see only his virtues and goodness. \n\nOn the other hand, when he is not around, she finds herself noticing only his faults. This could be interpreted as her longing and desire for his presence. In his absence, she may be more critical or aware of his shortcomings, perhaps because she misses him or perhaps because his absence makes her feel incomplete.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the depth of marital love and the emotional bond between husband and wife. It highlights how love can make us overlook flaws and, at the same time, how the absence of a loved one can make their flaws more apparent. This dual perspective reveals the complexity of human emotions and the power of love in shaping our perceptions..The kural verse:உய்த்தல் அறிந்து புனல்பாய் பவரேபோல்பொய்த்தல் அறிந்தென் புலந்து. ,translates to :To leap in stream which carries off When lord is close to feign a huff,and it's explantion is :The verse 1287 of Thiru Kural talks about the futility of pretense in a relationship, particularly a marital one. \n\nIn this verse, Valluvar uses the metaphor of jumping into a stream that one knows will carry them away. The leap into the stream is an inevitable surrender to a known outcome, just as a wife's purported dislike towards her husband is a temporary facade that she knows will not last long. \n\nThe poet questions the reason behind such pretense, as it stands to deliver no real benefit. He suggests that honesty and acceptance should prevail in a relationship, rather than pointless actions that only serve to create temporary discord.\n\nThis verse is a piece of advice to couples, urging them to refrain from playing emotional games or creating unnecessary conflicts. It emphasizes the importance of being genuine in expressing feelings and emotions, as pretense can lead to misunderstanding and unnecessary strife. \n\nThe essence of this verse is thus a call to honesty and transparency in relationships, particularly in a marital relationship, where such traits form the foundation of a long and harmonious journey together..The kural verse:இளித்தக்க இன்னா செயினும் களித்தார்க்குக்கள்ளற்றே கள்வநின் மார்பு. ,translates to :Like wine to addicts that does disgrace Your breast, O thief, is for my embrace!,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1288 is a profound verse that explores the theme of intoxication, but not in the literal sense of alcohol consumption. Instead, it uses this as a metaphor to describe the intoxicating allure of a beloved's charm, despite the suffering it may bring. \n\nThe verse says, \"O you rogue! your breast is to me what liquor is to those who rejoice in it, though it only gives them an unpleasant disgrace\". Here, the speaker addresses their lover as a 'rogue', indicating a sense of playful admonishment. The lover's charm (represented metaphorically as the 'breast') is likened to liquor for those who indulge in it. Even though liquor is known to cause unpleasant consequences and even disgrace, those who enjoy it continue to seek it. \n\nSimilarly, the speaker is so smitten by the allure of their lover that even if it brings pain and suffering, they are irresistibly drawn towards it. They acknowledge this paradoxical attraction, much like the drunkard who knows the ill-effects of liquor but is unable to resist its lure. \n\nThe cultural context here is the Tamil tradition of romantic and devotional poetry where the beloved or the divine is often depicted as an intoxicating presence. The moral interpretation is about the overpowering nature of love and attraction, which can make people overlook the potential negative consequences. \n\nThis verse is a classic example of the emotional depth and complexity captured in Thiru Kural's verses, using simple yet powerful metaphors..The kural verse:மலரினும் மெல்லிது காமம் சிலர்அதன்செவ்வி தலைப்படு வார். ,translates to :Flower-soft is love; a few alone Know its delicacy so fine,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1289 speaks about the nuanced nature of romantic pleasure. It compares the delicacy of this pleasure to that of a flower, suggesting that it is something to be handled with utmost care, sensitivity, and understanding. Just as a flower is soft, delicate, and can be easily damaged if not handled properly, so too is romantic pleasure. It requires the right conditions, a deep understanding, and appreciative handling to truly experience its depths and beauty.\n\nHowever, the verse goes on to state that there are only a few who truly understand this delicate nature of romantic pleasure. Just as only a few can handle a flower without causing it any damage, only a few people can navigate the complexities of romantic pleasure effectively. They are the ones who can create the right conditions, possess the depth of understanding, and have the sensitivity to handle it appropriately, thereby experiencing its full potential.\n\nThis verse, thus, emphasizes on the need for understanding, sensitivity, and delicacy in matters of love and romance. It also highlights the fact that true enjoyment of romance is not just about physical pleasure, but understanding its deeper emotional and psychological aspects, and only those who can comprehend this can truly experience its real delight..The kural verse:கண்ணின் துனித்தே கலங்கினாள் புல்லுதல்என்னினும் தான்விதுப் புற்று. ,translates to :She feigned dislike awhile but flew Faster for embrace than I do,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thirukkural speaks about the complex dynamics of love and affection between two individuals. \n\nHere, the poet describes a scene where the woman initially displays a mild aversion or coldness in her eyes towards the man, perhaps as a playful tease or a mock display of anger. However, when they come into physical contact, her embrace is warmer and more passionate than his. The intensity of her warmth and affection surpasses his own, thereby revealing her true feelings for him.\n\nThe verse subtly captures the nuanced language of love where actions often speak louder than words or expressions. It underscores the notion that genuine affection and intimacy can't be concealed even behind the veils of mock anger or feigned indifference. This verse enriches our understanding of human emotions and the depth of romantic relationships, demonstrating that they are often filled with unspoken words and hidden sentiments, which can only be understood through the magnifying lens of love and empathy. \n\nIn conclusion, this verse from Thirukkural beautifully communicates the concept that true love transcends beyond the surface-level expressions and penetrates into the realm of heartfelt emotions and passionate desires..The kural verse:அவர்நெஞ்சு அவர்க்காதல் கண்டும் எவன்நெஞ்சேநீஎமக்கு ஆகா தது. ,translates to :You see, his heart is his alone; Why not my heart be all my own?,and it's explantion is :This verse is a poignant reflection on unrequited love, as expressed from the perspective of a heartbroken lover. The poet personifies the heart, addressing it directly and questioning its incessant yearning for the beloved who does not reciprocate the feelings.\n\nThe verse essentially says, \"O heart! You have witnessed that their heart does not waver and stays loyal to them, not thinking of us. Despite seeing this, why do you not stay steadfast with me, instead of constantly being drawn to them?\" \n\nThe lover is puzzled and pained by his own heart's loyalty to the beloved, despite the lack of reciprocation. This verse reflects the inner turmoil of unrequited love, where one's heart seems to have a will of its own, relentlessly yearning for the beloved, no matter the circumstances. The verse beautifully captures the longing, frustration and anguish that come with one-sided love..The kural verse:உறாஅ தவர்க்கண்ட கண்ணும் அவரைச்செறாஅரெனச் சேறியென் நெஞ்சு. ,translates to :O heart, you see how he slights me Yet you clasp him as if friendly,and it's explantion is :Kural 1292 is a poignant verse that deals with the paradoxes of love and the inner conflict of the heart. \n\nThe verse, in its essence, addresses the speaker's own heart and expresses a sense of bewilderment and frustration. The speaker knows that the person they love does not reciprocate their feelings. Despite this painful realization, the heart is drawn towards them, holding onto a hope that they will not be displeased or reject the speaker's advances. \n\nThis verse brings out the irrationality that often comes with deep love. Even when we know that the object of our affection does not share the same feelings, we are still drawn to them, unable to control our emotions. The heart, in its optimistic naivety, continues to hope for a positive response, ignoring the harsh reality of unrequited love.\n\nThiruvalluvar, through this verse, paints a vivid picture of the pain, longing, and hopeful yet futile pursuit that characterizes unrequited love. Despite knowing the truth, the heart still clings to the slight possibility of affection from the other person and this beautifully captures the enduring and hopeful nature of love, even in the face of despair..The kural verse:கெட்டார்க்கு நட்டார்இல் என்பதோ நெஞ்சேநீபெட்டாங்கு அவர்பின் செலல். ,translates to :You follow him at will Is it \\\"The fallen have no friends\\\" my heart?,and it's explantion is :This Thirukural verse is a profound reflection on human relationships, hardship, and loyalty. It is presented in the form of a rhetorical question, addressed to the speaker's soul. The speaker seems to be contemplating the nature of friendship and loyalty, particularly in times of adversity.\n\nThe verse essentially poses a question: Is the soul following someone out of a belief that those who have fallen on hard times will not find any friends? This suggests that the speaker's soul is pursuing someone who has experienced misfortune, perhaps out of compassion or a sense of obligation.\n\nThe cultural context of this verse lies in the ancient Tamil tradition of loyalty and duty towards friends, especially during their difficult times. It highlights the moral responsibility that one has to stand by their friends in times of hardship, even when others abandon them.\n\nSo, the verse calls for introspection on our motivations. Are we following someone because we genuinely care for them and want to help them in their time of need? Or are we doing it out of a misguided belief that those who are ruined will have no other friends? It encourages us to examine our intentions and ensure that our actions are driven by true empathy and loyalty, rather than pity or a sense of obligation..The kural verse:இனிஅன்ன நின்னொடு சூழ்வார்யார் நெஞ்சேதுனிசெய்து துவ்வாய்காண் மற்று. ,translates to :You won't sulk first and then submit Who will then consult you, my heart?,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural addresses the human heart or soul, personifying it as a counsellor. The poet, Thiruvalluvar, uses a rhetorical question to emphasize the importance of consistency and transparency in love and relationships.\n\nThe verse states, \"O my heart! You must not first show displeasure or indifference (sulk) and then derive pleasure (enjoyment) from the same person. Who would seek your advice on matters of love if you act in such a fickle manner?\" \n\nIn other words, the poet advises that one should not display a moody or unpredictable temperament in love. One should not initially show disinterest or displeasure towards a loved one and then later enjoy their company. Such inconsistent behavior is not conducive to a healthy relationship. \n\nThis verse emphasizes the importance of being genuine, consistent, and transparent in one's emotions, especially in matters of love. It warns against fickleness, as it can lead to mistrust and misunderstanding in relationships. It encourages individuals to be steadfast and reliable in their emotional responses, as this builds trust and credibility in relationships. \n\nIn the broader sense, this verse not only applies to romantic relationships but also to all types of human interactions. It encourages consistent and genuine behavior, which is the foundation of trust and mutual respect in any relationship..The kural verse:பெறாஅமை அஞ்சும் பெறின்பிரிவு அஞ்சும்அறாஅ இடும்பைத்தென் நெஞ்சு. ,translates to :Frets to gain and fears loss in gain O my heart suffers ceaseless pain,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural, Kural 1295, speaks about the constant state of anxiety and fear associated with love. The poet says that their heart is in perpetual distress due to two contradictory fears associated with their beloved.\n\nThe first fear arises when the beloved is not around. The absence of the loved one can bring about a sense of loneliness, longing, and worry about their well-being, hence leading to fear and anxiety.\n\nThe second fear arises when the beloved is present. Even though their presence brings joy, there is a lingering fear of an impending separation that can occur at any moment. This fear of losing the loved one or having to part ways can cause as much anxiety as their absence. \n\nThus, the poet's heart is in a constant state of unease, caught between the fear of not having their beloved around and the fear of parting from them. This verse beautifully depicts the bittersweet nature of love, where joy and sorrow are intertwined, leading to continuous emotional turmoil..The kural verse:தனியே இருந்து நினைத்தக்கால் என்னைத்தினிய இருந்ததென் நெஞ்சு. ,translates to :My itching mind eats me anon As I muse on him all alone,and it's explantion is :This Kural verse speaks about the intensity of longing felt in the absence of a loved one. It illustrates the emotional anguish experienced in solitude when one is separated from their beloved.\n\nHere, the poet uses a metaphor to describe the state of his mind. He says that whenever he is alone and thoughts of his beloved cross his mind, it feels as if his heart is eating him up. This is a powerful analogy to depict the gnawing pain and the consuming nature of longing and separation.\n\nThis verse is an excellent portrayal of the emotional turmoil and inner suffering one endures in solitude, especially in the context of love and separation. It underscores the profound impact of loneliness and the deep desire for the beloved's presence.\n\nIn a broader sense, it also reiterates the universal human experience of missing someone deeply, showing how thoughts of the person can pervade one's mind and intensify the feelings of loneliness and longing..The kural verse:நாணும் மறந்தேன் அவர்மறக் கல்லாஎன்மாணா மடநெஞ்சிற் பட்டு. ,translates to :I forget shame but not his thought In mean foolish mind I'm caught,and it's explantion is :The Kural 1297 speaks about the depth and intensity of love and affection one person can have for another. It portrays how love can be so overpowering that it makes one forget their own sense of decorum and modesty. \n\nIn this verse, the speaker admits to losing their self-respect and modesty, being so deeply in love. They confess to being unable to forget the one they love, caught in the relentless grip of their foolish heart that refuses to let go. This can be interpreted as the speaker being so consumed by their love that they disregard societal norms or personal boundaries, which might be seen as a lack of self-respect or dignity.\n\nThis Kural illustrates the overpowering nature of love, where one’s emotions can become so intense that it overrides one's personal inhibitions and societal norms. It portrays that when in love, a person may forget their own dignity in the face of their overwhelming affection for the other person. This is an enduring theme in literature, where love is often depicted as a powerful force that can make people act out of character. \n\nThe moral interpretation of this verse could be a cautionary message about the extremes one can reach when they are deeply in love. It serves as a reminder to maintain one's self-respect and dignity, even in the face of overpowering emotions..The kural verse:எள்ளின் இளிவாம்என்று எண்ணி அவர்திறம்உள்ளும் உயிர்க்காதல் நெஞ்சு. ,translates to :My heart living in love of him Hails his glory ignoring blame,and it's explantion is :Kural 1298 is a poignant reflection on love and separation. It talks about the deep emotional attachment one feels towards a loved one, even when they are not physically present. \n\nThe verse states that the heart, which holds a deep affection, continues to value the departed lover due to a fear of disgrace if it were to belittle them. In other words, the heart is so much in love that it fears the thought of disrespecting or diminishing the loved one in their absence. It clings to the idea of the beloved's virtues, constantly reminding itself of their greatness and qualities. \n\nThis verse is a testament to the power of love, where the love for someone can be so strong that it makes one honour the beloved even in their absence. It captures the essence of undying affection, where love isn't merely a feeling, but becomes a matter of one's honor and dignity. \n\nThus, this couplet underlines the depth of genuine love - a love that does not diminish or fade away with separation, but continues to hold the beloved in high regard, cherishing their virtues and fearing the thought of belittling them..The kural verse:துன்பத்திற்கு யாரே துணையாவார் தாமுடையநெஞ்சந் துணையல் வழி. ,translates to :Who support a man in grief If lover's heart denies relief?,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of self-reliance and inner strength during times of distress. It conveys the idea that if one's own heart, which is the closest and most personal entity to oneself, refuses to be of assistance during tough times, who else can be expected to come to one's aid? \n\nThe 'heart' here can be interpreted as one's own courage, willpower, and resilience. If these qualities are absent, external help would make little difference. It underscores the significance of self-confidence and inner strength in overcoming life's challenges. \n\nIt urges individuals to first look within themselves for solutions before seeking external help. It promotes the belief that the first step in solving a problem lies within oneself, and only when one's own heart is in agreement, one can expect others to assist. This verse highlights the concept of self-help and inner fortitude that are often considered vital in the Tamil culture..The kural verse:தஞ்சம் தமரல்லர் ஏதிலார் தாமுடையநெஞ்சம் தமரல் வழி. ,translates to :Why wonder if strangers disown When one's own heart is not his own?,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural talks about the concept of self-alienation and its impact on our relationships. The essence of the verse is that if a person's own heart or conscience behaves like a stranger to them, then it becomes remarkably easy for outsiders or other people to behave like strangers as well.\n\nThe heart or soul here represents a person's innermost feelings, thoughts, and moral compass. When a person becomes disconnected from their own heart or inner self, they lose their self-awareness and understanding. As a result, they can no longer relate to their own emotions or values, and they may behave in ways that are out of character or against their own interests.\n\nWhen one's own heart behaves like a stranger, it indicates a state of emotional or spiritual disconnection within oneself. This internal disconnection can lead to external disconnections as well, impairing one's relationships and interactions with others.\n\nIn other words, the verse implies that the harmony in our external relationships mirrors the harmony within ourselves. If we are disconnected from our own hearts, we are likely to experience disconnection in our relationships with others. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain a strong connection with our own hearts or souls to cultivate healthy and authentic relationships with others..The kural verse:புல்லா திராஅப் புலத்தை அவர்உறும்அல்லல்நோய் காண்கம் சிறிது. ,translates to :Feign sulk; embrace him not so that We can see his distress a bit,and it's explantion is :Kural 1301 is a classic verse that illustrates the playful aspect of love, specifically, the concept of 'Oodal' - a traditional Tamil term referring to the lover's feigned anger or sulking to seek more affection from their partner. \n\nThe verse suggests that one should temporarily feign dislike and refrain from embracing their lover to witness their discomfort and longing caused by this separation. This is not suggested out of cruelty, but rather as a playful strategy in love, to deepen the bond between the lovers. The lover's suffering in this context is not one of physical pain, but of emotional longing and desire. \n\nThe underlying sentiment of this Kural is the joy and satisfaction derived from knowing that one is deeply loved and missed by their partner. It underscores the idea that love is not just about constant closeness and affection, but also about the sweet pain of temporary separation, which intensifies the longing and subsequently, the reunion. \n\nIn essence, this Kural highlights the complex, multi-faceted nature of love, emphasizing that the moments of 'Oodal' or 'feigned displeasure' are as integral to the experience of love as the moments of intimacy and togetherness..The kural verse:உப்பமைந் தற்றால் புலவி அதுசிறிதுமிக்கற்றால் நீள விடல். ,translates to :Sulking is the salt of love; but Too much of it spoils the taste Wife Addresses Husband,and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse, 1302, uses a culinary metaphor to explain the concept of \"dislike\" or \"estrangement\" in relationships. The verse compares the right proportion of salt in a dish to a little amount of dislike in a relationship. Just as the right amount of salt enhances the flavor of the food, a small amount of estrangement or indifference can add a certain spark or interest in a relationship, keeping it lively and interesting. \n\nHowever, the verse warns that, just as too much salt can ruin a dish, prolonging this dislike or indifference can damage the relationship. If the feeling of estrangement exceeds its limit, it can lead to bitterness and resentment, just as excessive salt can make the food inedible. \n\nThe verse reminds us of the importance of maintaining a balance in relationships. It emphasizes moderation and warns against allowing negative emotions to exceed their limits. Just as a skilled cook knows the right amount of salt to add, individuals should also be aware of the right amount of 'dislike' or 'estrangement' they allow in their relationships.\n\nIn essence, this verse provides wisdom about human relationships and the complex emotions involved in it. It teaches that a pinch of dislike or playful estrangement can add flavor to a relationship, but one must be careful not to let it spill over and spoil the relationship..The kural verse:அலந்தாரை அல்லல்நோய் செய்தற்றால் தம்மைப்புலந்தாரைப் புல்லா விடல். ,translates to :To leave the sulker unembraced Is to grieve the one sorely grieved,and it's explantion is :Kural 1303 speaks about the dynamics of romantic relationships, particularly addressing the concept of feigned indifference or dislike, a common trope in traditional Tamil love literature. When one person in the relationship pretends to be upset or shows disinterest as a part of their affective play, it is the duty of the other to pacify and embrace them, instead of ignoring or distancing themselves.\n\nThe Kural likens the act of distancing oneself from a person feigning dislike to inflicting pain on someone already in agony. Just as it is cruel to exacerbate the suffering of a person already in distress, it is also hurtful to ignore or alienate a lover who is pretending to be upset or indifferent. \n\nIn essence, the Kural emphasizes empathy, understanding, and tact in handling the complexities of romantic relationships. It stresses the importance of responding with affection and care, even when faced with seemingly indifferent or unfriendly attitudes from the beloved. It also underscores the moral responsibility to alleviate the emotional distress of others, rather than adding to their pain..The kural verse:ஊடி யவரை உணராமை வாடியவள்ளி முதலரிந் தற்று. ,translates to :To comfort not lady in pout Is to cut the fading plant at root He within Himself,and it's explantion is :Kural 1304 addresses the importance of reconciliation in a relationship, particularly one where a disagreement or misunderstanding has taken place. The verse metaphorically compares not reconciling with someone who has feigned disapproval or dislike, to cutting a faded creeper at its root.\n\nThe essence of this verse is to emphasize the sensitivity required in managing relationships, especially when there's a misunderstanding or a temporary conflict. When someone feigns disapproval or shows 'Oodal' (a traditional Tamil expression symbolizing a lover's feigned anger or dislike), it's often a call for attention or an expression of their emotional state. Therefore, not trying to understand this emotional signal and reconcile with them, but instead letting the relationship fade away, is as drastic as cutting a creeper that has faded, right from its root. \n\nThe creeper here symbolizes the relationship. Just as a faded creeper can be nurtured back to health with care and attention, a relationship experiencing a rough phase can also be mended with understanding, patience, and love. \n\nHence, the kural imparts a valuable lesson on the significance of reconciliation, patience, and empathy in maintaining and nurturing relationships. It prompts us to respond with love and understanding, rather than indifference, to those showing signs of emotional distress or displeasure..The kural verse:நலத்தகை நல்லவர்க்கு ஏஎர் புலத்தகைபூஅன்ன கண்ணார் அகத்து. ,translates to :Pouting of flower-eyed has To pure good mates a lovely grace,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 1305, from Thiru Kural, a classic Tamil text authored by Thiruvalluvar, explores the theme of love and the fine nuances of a romantic relationship. \n\nThe verse reads: \"An increased shyness in those whose eyes are like flowers is beautiful even to good and virtuous husbands.\" \n\nIn this Kural, Thiruvalluvar is emphasizing the allure and charm that shyness brings into a romantic relationship, especially when it is expressed by a woman whose eyes are as beautiful and expressive as flowers. The comparison of a woman's eyes to flowers is a common metaphor in Tamil literature, denoting the depth of her emotions and the beauty of her soul. \n\nThe verse further states that this shyness or modesty is incredibly appealing even to virtuous and good-hearted husbands. This is a subtle reference to the cultural context in which Thiruvalluvar lived, where modesty and shyness in women were considered virtues and added to their charm and attractiveness. \n\nIn essence, this Kural is a celebration of the subtle dynamics of a romantic relationship, where even the nuanced expressions like shyness contribute to the overall beauty and depth of the relationship. It's a reminder that love thrives not just in grand gestures, but also in these small, subtle expressions of affection and emotion..The kural verse:துனியும் புலவியும் இல்லாயின் காமம்கனியும் கருக்காயும் அற்று. ,translates to :Love devoid of frowns and pets Misses its ripe and unripe fruits,and it's explantion is :Kural 1306 delves into the complexities of love and sexual desire, using the metaphor of ripe and unripe fruit to illustrate its point. The verse posits that sexual pleasure devoid of both short-lived and prolonged dislike, is as unfulfilling as fruit that is either overripe or not ripe enough.\n\nThe first part of the kural, \"Thuniyum Pulaviyum Illaayin Kaamam\", talks about love or sexual desire that lacks both prolonged (Thuni) and short-lived (Pulavi) dislikes. In a relationship, it's natural to have moments of disagreement or dislike. However, the absence of these moments might indicate a lack of depth or emotional involvement in the relationship.\n\nThe second part of the kural, \"Kaniyum Karukkaayum Arru\", draws an analogy to fruit that is either too ripe (Kaniyum) or unripe (Karukkaayum). An overripe fruit, while edible, lacks the freshness and vitality of a perfectly ripe one. Similarly, an unripe fruit is hard and lacks the sweetness of maturity. \n\nThus, the kural suggests that a love life devoid of any disagreements or dislikes, is akin to eating fruit that is either overripe or not ripe enough. It lacks the complexity, the balance of sweetness and tartness, that makes the experience fulfilling and satisfying. The kural emphasizes the importance of experiencing a full spectrum of emotions in a relationship, including moments of dislike, for it to be truly meaningful and fulfilling..The kural verse:ஊடலின் உண்டாங்கோர் துன்பம் புணர்வதுநீடுவ தன்று கொல் என்று. ,translates to :\\\"Will union take place soon or late?\\\" In lover's pout this leaves a doubt,and it's explantion is :Kural 1307 explores the emotional complexity of romantic relationships, particularly with respect to anticipation and uncertainty. It states that even in the midst of feigned dislike, often seen as playful banter or \"hard-to-get\" games in love, there exists a certain level of anxiety. This anxiety stems from the uncertainty of when their next intimate union will occur, causing a unique form of sorrow. \n\nThis verse highlights how, in love, even the most joyous moments are often intertwined with a sense of apprehension about the future. The anticipation of future happiness often leads to anxiety and melancholy, particularly when there is uncertainty. It underscores that love is not just about the pleasure of the present moment, but is also deeply connected with the hopes, expectations, and anxieties about the future. \n\nThis verse reminds us of the importance of communication and understanding in a relationship. It suggests that uncertainty can lead to emotional distress, even amidst the joys of love. Thus, it encourages lovers to communicate their feelings and expectations clearly to each other to mitigate such anxieties..The kural verse:நோதல் எவன்மற்று நொந்தாரென்று அஃதறியும்காதலர் இல்லா வழி. ,translates to :What's the good of grieving lament When concious lover is not present?,and it's explantion is :Kural 1308 discusses the profound importance of empathy in a romantic relationship. The verse expresses the sentiment of a person who is in anguish and yearns for someone who can understand and share their pain. \n\nThe verse says, \"What avails sorrow when I am without a wife who can understand the cause of my sorrow?\" The term 'wife' here is symbolic of a loving companion who can empathize with the speaker's emotional state. \n\nThe speaker is essentially questioning the worth of their sorrow if there is no one to understand it. This highlights the human need for companionship and empathy, especially during times of distress. When one is in sorrow, the presence of a loved one who can comprehend the depth of their pain, share in their distress, and provide comfort is invaluable. \n\nIn the absence of such a person, the speaker feels that their sorrow is futile because there is nobody to acknowledge it. It underscores the loneliness and despair that can stem from having one's emotional suffering go unrecognized.\n\nThis verse from Thiru Kural thus beautifully encapsulates the longing for understanding and shared empathy in a relationship, emphasizing the role of emotional support and mutual understanding in alleviating personal suffering..The kural verse:நீரும் நிழலது இனிதே புலவியும்வீழுநர் கண்ணே இனிது. ,translates to :Water delights in a shady grove And sulking in souls of psychic love,and it's explantion is :Kural 1309 explores the dynamics of love with an apt metaphor. It suggests that just as water tastes more refreshing when it's under the shade, the occasional disagreements or playful quarrels (referred to as 'dislike' in the literal translation) between lovers become enjoyable experiences only when they are rooted in deep love.\n\nThe two lines of the verse draw a parallel between the physical comfort of cool water in the shade and the emotional comfort of playful disagreements in a loving relationship. The shade represents the security and protection provided by love, under which the water (or the relationship) remains cool and pleasant. Similarly, any disagreements or quarrels that occur within the realm of love are not distressing but rather add a different flavor to the relationship, making it more vibrant and alive.\n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes that the unique sweetness of love transforms even disagreements into delightful experiences. However, it also subtly implies that these disagreements are enjoyable only when they are within the confines of love, much like how water is refreshing only when it is under the shade, away from the scorching sun..The kural verse:ஊடல் உணங்க விடுவாரோடு என்நெஞ்சம்கூடுவேம் என்பது அவா. ,translates to :My heart athirst would still unite With her who me in sulking left!,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 1310, is a profound observation on the power of desire and longing in human relationships, particularly in the context of romantic love. The poet says that even when one's beloved behaves indifferently or distances themselves, the desire within the lover's heart still aspires to unite with them. This is not due to any external force, but rather the strong internal desire or passion that exists within the lover's heart.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse underlines the intensity of desire that can often override rational thought or the reality of the situation. It highlights how the human heart, in the throes of passion, can overlook pain and rejection in its quest to be united with the object of its affection. \n\nThe verse also subtly alludes to the complex nature of human emotions and how they are not always dictated by the actions or responses of others, but can be driven by our internal feelings and desires. It is a testament to the human capacity to love and long for someone, even in the face of indifference or rejection. \n\nIn essence, this verse is a poignant reflection on the power of desire, the complexity of human emotions, and the enduring spirit of love..The kural verse:பெண்ணியலார் எல்லாரும் கண்ணின் பொதுஉண்பர்நண்ணேன் பரத்தநின் மார்பு. ,translates to :I shrink to clasp you bosom lewd To the gaze of all ladies exposed,and it's explantion is :Kural 1311 is a poignant verse that metaphorically speaks of the protagonist's refusal to accept a woman who has lost her virtue. The protagonist addresses the woman directly, stating that she has given herself to public use, losing her individual dignity and respect. The phrase 'all those who are born as womankind enjoy you with their eyes in an ordinary way' depicts that she has become an object of casual and common gaze, losing her sacredness and exclusivity.\n\nThe protagonist declares his unwillingness to embrace her, symbolizing his refusal to accept her in his life due to her promiscuous behaviors. This verse serves as a moral lesson, emphasizing the importance of virtue and integrity in a woman, and the consequences of its loss.\n\nIn a broader context, this verse can be interpreted as a critique of a society where women's dignity and respect are being undermined. It highlights the need for upholding moral values and the consequences of their degradation..The kural verse:ஊடி இருந்தேமாத் தும்மினார் யாம்தம்மைநீடுவாழ் கென்பாக் கறிந்து. ,translates to :He sneezed while we went on sulking Expecting me to say \\\"live long\\\",and it's explantion is :This verse belongs to the chapter on 'Nakarikam' or 'Sulking' in Thirukural, where Valluvar explores the complex dynamics of love, particularly the delicate play of emotions between lovers.\n\nThe verse 1312 can be translated as:\n\n\"When I continued to be sulky, he sneezed, hoping that I would break my silence and wish him a long life.\"\n\nIn the context of Tamil culture, it is customary to wish someone a long life when they sneeze. Thus, in this verse, the poet narrates a situation where the beloved is sulking and refraining from speaking to her lover. In an attempt to break her silence, the lover sneezes, hoping that she would, out of habit, wish him a long life, thus breaking her vow of silence.\n\nThis verse beautifully captures the nuances of love, where even the smallest acts are filled with meaning and expectation. The lover's sneeze is not just a physical act, but a subtle plea for reconciliation and communication. The verse portrays the depth of their relationship where even in the state of sulking, the concern for each other's well-being persists. \n\nFurthermore, this verse also reflects the intricate emotional play in romantic relationships, where silence speaks volumes, and even the smallest gestures carry significant emotional weight..The kural verse:கோட்டுப்பூச் சூடினும் காயும் ஒருத்தியைக்காட்டிய சூடினீர் என்று. ,translates to :\\\"For which lady?\\\" she widely cries While I adorn myself with flowers,and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 1313, is a poignant expression of misunderstood intentions in a romantic relationship. It highlights the protagonist's dismay over his beloved's suspicion and jealousy, despite his innocent actions. \n\nThe verse metaphorically uses a 'garland of branch-flowers' as an ornament that the protagonist adorns. In the Tamil culture, flowers are often associated with beauty, love, and romantic interest. Here, the protagonist is saying that even if he were to wear a garland made from flowers that had bloomed on a branch, his beloved would misconstrue it as him trying to impress another woman. \n\nThis reflects a deep sense of insecurity and mistrust from his beloved's side. It illustrates the pain and frustration when sincere actions are misinterpreted due to jealousy and suspicion. The verse underscores the importance of trust and understanding in maintaining the harmony of a relationship.\n\nIn a broader context, this Kural could be interpreted as a commentary on how misunderstandings and misinterpretations can strain relationships, whether they are romantic, friendly, or professional. It emphasizes the need for clear communication and trust to avoid such situations..The kural verse:யாரினும் காதலம் என்றேனா ஊடினாள்யாரினும் யாரினும் என்று. ,translates to :\\\"I love you more than all\\\" I said \\\"Than whom, than whom?\\\" she sulked and chid,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural illustrates the complexity and subtlety of love and communication, especially in a romantic relationship. The protagonist professes his love for his beloved, asserting that it is greater than his love for any other. However, the woman, perhaps due to a misunderstanding or a desire for further reassurance, interprets his statement differently. She questions his love, asking 'more than whom?' repeatedly, indicating a hint of jealousy or insecurity.\n\nThe verse captures the nuances of love in a relationship, where words can be interpreted in various ways depending on the state of mind of the listener. It suggests that in love, even a declaration of devotion can be seen as a comparison or competition, stirring feelings of unease and doubt. The verse encourages the reader to be mindful of their words and the way they may be received, especially in the matters of the heart.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse also reflects the cultural emphasis on clear and thoughtful communication, an understanding of the other's emotional state, and the need for reassurance in demonstrating love and affection..The kural verse:இம்மைப் பிறப்பில் பிரியலம் என்றேனாக்கண்நிறை நீர்கொண் டனள். ,translates to :\\\"In this life we won't part\\\" I told Her eyes at once with tears were filled,and it's explantion is :Kural 1315 is a profound verse that speaks about the depth of love and the fear of separation in a relationship. When the lover reassures his beloved that they would never part in this lifetime, she is moved to tears. However, her tears are not just an expression of joy or relief, they stem from a deeper worry: What about the next life? \n\nThe verse beautifully encapsulates the insecurities and the longing in love. The beloved is fearful of the unknown, specifically the possibility of being separated in the next life. Her tears reveal her deep attachment to her lover and her dread of losing him, even in the future lives. \n\nThis verse also subtly highlights the belief in reincarnation, a prevalent concept in Hindu philosophy. The fear of separation is not just limited to this life but extends to future lives as well, showcasing the intensity of their love. \n\nTo summarize, this verse portrays the profound love between two individuals where the assurance of togetherness in this life leads to the fear of separation in the next. It underlines the depth of their bond and the agonizing possibility of being parted, demonstrating the complexities of love and attachment..The kural verse:உள்ளினேன் என்றேன்மற் றென்மறந்தீர் என்றென்னைப்புல்லாள் புலத்தக் கனள். ,translates to :I said I thought of you She left Her embrace crying \\\"Oft you forget\\\",and it's explantion is :This verse is a poignant reflection of the complex dynamics of love and communication between two individuals. Here, the protagonist admits to his beloved that he had been thinking about her. However, paradoxically, his beloved interprets this as a sign of forgetting, rather than remembering. Her logic is, if he truly remembered her constantly, there wouldn't be a need to specifically mention it. She infers that there must have been a period of forgetfulness, prompting him to consciously remember her and mention it.\n\nThis misunderstanding escalates into a playful yet hurtful quarrel, where she withdraws her affection and starts to feign dislike. This verse, therefore, underscores the fragile and sensitive nature of love, and how simple misinterpretations can lead to emotional turmoil. It also highlights the importance of effective communication and understanding in maintaining a harmonious relationship. \n\nThe verse is a classic illustration of the nuanced play of emotions that is characteristic of Thirukkural's love and relationships segment. It presents a poignant picture of the misunderstandings that can arise in a relationship due to different perceptions and interpretations of the same situation..The kural verse:வழுத்தினாள் தும்மினேன் ஆக அழித்தழுதாள்யாருள்ளித் தும்மினீர் என்று. ,translates to :I sneezed; she blessed; then changed and wept  \\\"You sneezed now at which lady's thought?\\\",and it's explantion is :This Thiru Kural verse (1317) delves into the complexities of love and jealousy in human relationships. The verse is a conversation between two lovers, where the man sneezes and the woman, following a traditional custom, blesses him for a long life. However, her emotions take a swift turn as she is overtaken by suspicion and insecurity. She questions him, \"At the thought of whom did you sneeze?\" \n\nThis question is based on a superstition that if one sneezes, it is believed someone is thinking of them. Her insecurity makes her worry that another woman might be thinking of her beloved, hence his sneeze. Overwhelmed by these thoughts, she begins to weep, contradicting the blessing she just gave.\n\nThe verse beautifully captures the delicate balance in love, where trust, insecurity, and possessiveness coexist. It also throws light on the cultural beliefs that existed during the period, showing how they influence human emotions and relationships. Thiruvalluvar, the poet, uses this scenario to depict the depth of love and the intensity of feelings in a relationship..The kural verse:தும்முச் செறுப்ப அழுதாள் நுமர்உள்ளல்எம்மை மறைத்திரோ என்று. ,translates to :I repressed sneeze; she wept crying \\\"Your thoughts from me you are hiding\\\",and it's explantion is :This verse, Kural 1318, is a beautiful portrayal of the intense love and sensitivity existing between two individuals, often reflecting the romantic exchanges in Tamil Sangam literature. Here, the poet narrates a scenario where he suppresses his sneeze in order to not disturb his beloved. Upon seeing this, his beloved assumes that he might be doing so to hide the remembrance of his own people from her. \n\nIn traditional Tamil belief, it is considered that when one sneezes, it indicates someone close to them is remembering them. So, when the lover suppressed his sneeze, his beloved felt that he might be doing so to hide the fact that he is being remembered by someone else, possibly another lover. This assumption makes her weep, as she feels that her lover is hiding something from her.\n\nThis verse underlines the depth of her love for him, her sensitivity towards his actions, and her fear of losing him to someone else. It also illustrates the cultural context of the time, where sneezing was seen as a sign of being recalled by someone dear. The verse is a poignant expression of deep love, intense emotions, and the insecurities that come with it..The kural verse:தன்னை உணர்த்தினும் காயும் பிறர்க்கும்நீர்இந்நீரர் ஆகுதிர் என்று. ,translates to :I try to coax her and she remarks \\\"Your coaxing others thus this marks\\\",and it's explantion is :Kural 1319 delves into the nuances of love and misunderstanding. The verse portrays a situation where a man tries to appease his beloved, who is upset with him. Despite his sincere efforts, she misinterprets his actions, suspecting that he is equally kind and affectionate to other women as well. \n\nThe phrase \"I see, quoth she, to other folks How you are wondrous kind\" demonstrates her doubt about his loyalty and exclusivity towards her. The woman is giving voice to her insecurities and jealousy, fearing that his affections are not unique to her. \n\nIn the phrase \"Even when I try to remove her dislike, she is displeased...\", the man expresses his frustration and helplessness. No matter what he does to reassure her, she remains unsatisfied, interpreting his actions through a lens of suspicion.\n\nThis verse highlights a common human tendency to doubt and suspect, even in love. It brings into light the complexities involved in human relationships and the importance of trust and clear communication. \n\nIn essence, Kural 1319 talks about the delicate dance of love, where misunderstandings and misinterpretations can often lead to discord, highlighting the need for trust, reassurance, and clear communication in maintaining harmony in relationships..The kural verse:நினைத்திருந்து நோக்கினும் காயும் அனைத்துநீர்யாருள்ளி நோக்கினீர் என்று. ,translates to :I think and gaze at her; she chides: \\\"On whom your thought just now abides?\\\",and it's explantion is :This Kural verse 1320 explores the theme of love and the misunderstandings that can arise within it. Here, the poet speaks from the perspective of a lovestruck individual who is misunderstood by his beloved. Despite his innocent admiration of her beauty, she misconstrues his gaze as comparing her with others, leading to her displeasure. \n\nThe verse illustrates how love can sometimes be clouded by insecurity and misinterpretations. The beloved, despite being admired, feels threatened by the mere thought of being compared to others. On the other hand, the lover, despite his pure appreciation for her beauty, is misunderstood. \n\nThis verse is not merely about romantic misunderstandings, but also serves as a metaphor for human relationships in general. It cautions us to be aware of how our actions can be misinterpreted and emphasizes the importance of clear communication in maintaining harmony in relationships. This verse teaches us that insecurities and misunderstandings can strain even the most loving relationships, and thus, one should tread with sensitivity and understanding..The kural verse:இல்லை தவறவர்க்கு ஆயினும் ஊடுதல்வல்லது அவர்அள஧க்கு மாறு. ,translates to :He is flawless; but I do pout So that his loving ways show out,and it's explantion is :Kural 1321 is an exploration of the dynamics in an intimate relationship. It suggests that even if one's partner is without any flaws, feigning displeasure or disinterest, which is referred to as 'Oodal' in Tamil, can often serve to intensify their affection.\n\nThis verse speaks to a certain playfulness that often exists in romantic relationships, expressing how feigned rejection or distance can sometimes increase the desire and affection of the other person, thereby strengthening the bond between the two.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this verse doesn't advocate for manipulation or deceit in relationships. Instead, it highlights an aspect of human nature where a little challenge or feigned disinterest can sometimes serve to rekindle one's interest or intensify the affection they feel.\n\nIn the broader sense, this verse underlines the nuances of human interaction, reminding us that relationships are complex and often the emotions we display may not always reflect our true feelings but are instead used to evoke certain responses from others. This verse is a testament to the profound understanding of human behavior and relationships showcased in Thiru Kural..The kural verse:ஊடலின் தோன்றும் சிறுதுனி நல்லளிவாடினும் பாடு பெறும். ,translates to :Fading first, love blooms and outlives The petty pricks that pouting gives,and it's explantion is :This verse from the Thirukkural is about the dynamics of love and affection in relationships. Here, Valluvar suggests that even if a lover's affection appears to wane momentarily due to small misunderstandings or annoyances (termed as 'Oodal', a period of feigned anger or sulk), the brief distress that results from it will actually serve to strengthen the bond of love.\n\nThe term 'Oodal' is a cultural concept in Tamil love literature which refers to lovers feigning anger or annoyance with each other, often as a means to express their deep-seated love and attachment.\n\nIn this context, the 'short-lived distress' is the temporary pain or discomfort that arises from these moments of 'Oodal'. Valluvar says that even though this distress might cause the love to seem diminished, it would actually intensify the love in the long run. This is because, such moments of distress allow for a deeper understanding and appreciation of one's partner, thus making the bond stronger and more meaningful.\n\nThe verse emphasizes that these minor conflicts and misunderstandings in love are not destructive, but rather constructive in nature. They are like tests that, once passed, result in a deeper, more profound connection between the two individuals. Thus, instead of being a deterrent, such instances of 'Oodal' bring about a greater sense of respect, understanding and affection in a relationship. \n\nOverall, this verse underscores the complexity and depth of love, and the role of conflict in strengthening relationships..The kural verse:புலத்தலின் புத்தேள்நாடு உண்டோ நிலத்தொடுநீரியைந் தன்னார் அகத்து. ,translates to :Is there a heaven like sulk beneath Of hearts that join like water and earth?,and it's explantion is :The verse 1323 of the Thiru Kural speaks about the joy experienced in the playful teasing or feigned dislike that exists between two individuals who share a deep bond of love. The comparison made here is between the inseparable union of earth and water, symbolizing the profound connection between two lovers.\n\nThe question posed in this verse is rhetorical: \"Is there a celestial land that can offer the same pleasure as experienced in the playful banter between two deeply connected individuals?\" The verse implies that the joy derived from such a bond, complete with its ups and downs, its teasing and pretending, is so profound that it could surpass even the pleasures of celestial realms.\n\nIn essence, Valluvar is celebrating the depth and complexity of human relationships, particularly the bond of love, and suggesting that the joy it offers is incomparable. This Kural highlights the beauty in human emotions and interactions, marking them as more pleasurable than even divine experiences. The moral interpretation of this verse emphasizes the importance of cherishing the intimate bonds we form in our lives and the joy they bring, suggesting they are the real treasures to be sought..The kural verse:புல்லி விடாஅப் புலவியுள் தோன்றுமென்உள்ளம் உடைக்கும் படை. ,translates to :In long pout after embrace sweet A weapon is up to break my heart,and it's explantion is :Kural 1324 speaks about the powerful emotional impact of longing and separation in love. The verse metaphorically refers to prolonged emotional separation as a weapon that can shatter the heart. \n\nThe poet says that when a loved one is physically close yet emotionally distant, it creates a sense of longing or 'oodal', a complex emotion in Tamil culture that refers to the pain and longing felt due to love's separation. This feeling is so intense that it is compared to a weapon capable of breaking the heart. \n\nThe poet emphasizes the deep emotional bond between lovers, highlighting how their emotional separation can cause profound heartache, akin to a physical wound inflicted by a weapon. This kural underscores the power of emotions and the profound impact of love and longing on the human heart. \n\nThe cultural context here is the age-old concept of 'Oodal' in Tamil culture. It is a unique form of pining in love, often dramatized in Tamil literature, highlighting the emotional depth and intensity of romantic relationships. The kural exquisitely encapsulates this feeling, stressing its power to disrupt the emotional stability of the lover..The kural verse:தவறிலர் ஆயினும் தாம்வீழ்வார் மென்றோள்அகறலின் ஆங்கொன் றுடைத்து. ,translates to :Though free form faults, one feels the charms Of feigned release from lover's arms,and it's explantion is :This verse from Thiru Kural is a reflection on the complex nature of human emotions, particularly in the context of romantic love. The verse acknowledges that even in situations where there is no fault or wrongdoing on the man's part, he may still experience a sense of pleasure when he is unable to embrace the delicate shoulders of the woman he loves. This emotion comes from a place of playful teasing or 'Oodal' - a concept in Tamil literature that refers to a lover's pretended anger or resentment as part of the dynamics of a loving relationship. \n\nThe verse suggests that even when separated or unable to express their affection physically, lovers derive a certain satisfaction or pleasure. It might be the anticipation of reunion, the sweet pain of longing, or simply the thrill of the emotional roller coaster that love often is. This nuanced understanding of love and relationships is a testament to the depth of insight in Thirukkural.\n\nIn a broader sense, the verse also speaks to the human ability to find joy in adversity, to appreciate the bittersweet moments in life, and to grow through difficulties. This perspective is not only relevant in personal relationships but also in our broader approach to life's challenges..The kural verse:உணலினும் உண்டது அறல்இனிது காமம்புணர்தலின் ஊடல் இனிது. ,translates to :Sweeter than meal is digestion And sulk in love than union,and it's explantion is :Kural 1326 is a profound observation on the nature of desire and fulfillment, particularly in the context of romantic love. The verse metaphorically compares the process of digestion with the experience of love and longing. \n\nThe verse starts by stating that the process of digesting what one has already consumed is more satisfying than the act of eating again. This is a metaphor for satisfaction and contentment that comes from savoring and appreciating what one already has, rather than seeking to consume more. It emphasizes mindfulness and appreciation of the present, as opposed to the constant pursuit of more.\n\nThe second part of the verse extends the metaphor to romantic love. It suggests that the feeling of longing or yearning in love (referred to as 'dislike' in the strict translation) is more delightful than the act of physical union. This is not a promotion of denial or rejection, but rather an acknowledgement of the beauty and depth of emotions that are stirred by the anticipation and longing in love. It suggests that the emotional dimensions of love and the anticipation of union can be as fulfilling, if not more, than the act of union itself.\n\nIn essence, Kural 1326 teaches us to savor and appreciate what we have, both in terms of our physical needs and emotional desires. It reminds us that the anticipation, longing, and emotional depth in love can be as fulfilling as the act of love itself, and that contentment comes from mindfulness and appreciation of the present..The kural verse:ஊடலில் தோற்றவர் வென்றார் அதுமன்னும்கூடலிற் காணப் படும். ,translates to :The yielder wins in lover's pout Reunited joy brings it out,and it's explantion is :Kural 1327 speaks about the complexities of love and the idea of mock anger or \"Oodal\" in relationships. Oodal refers to the playful resentment or feigned anger that lovers express towards each other, often as a means to spice up their relationship or to test their partner's affection. \n\nThe verse asserts that those who have overcome such mock anger are the true victors in love. Such victory is not just about winning an argument or a playful squabble, but about overcoming misunderstandings and resolving differences to reach a state of deeper love and understanding. \n\nThe second line of the verse states that the truth of this victory becomes evident when the lovers reconcile after their mock fights, leading them to a state of greater unity and joy. This verse subtly emphasizes the importance of communication, understanding, and reconciliation in love, which are crucial for a relationship to thrive and be fulfilling. \n\nIn essence, this Kural teaches us that the strength of love is not measured by the absence of disagreements but by the ability to overcome them and grow stronger together..The kural verse:ஊடிப் பெறுகுவம் கொல்லோ நுதல்வெயர்ப்பக்கூடலில் தோன்றிய உப்பு. ,translates to :Shall not our pouting again give The dew-browed joy of joint love?,and it's explantion is :Kural 1328 ponders on the sweet torment of love and the longing to experience it again. It uses the metaphor of a woman's forehead perspiring to indicate the intensity of passionate love. The poet wonders if he will get another chance to relish the pleasure derived from love, which is so intense that it makes her sweat. He yearns for the opportunity to experience this passionate love one more time, even if it's through a phase of feigned dislike or playful sulking (Oodal), a common trope in Tamil romantic literature.\n\nIn the cultural context, \"Oodal\" is a traditional form of expressing love where lovers pretend to be angry or upset with each other, adding sweetness and excitement to their relationship. This verse beautifully captures the longing to relive those intense moments of love and the playful quarrels that come with it. The poet cleverly uses \"dislike\" to refer to this playful phase of love, highlighting the complexity and depth of romantic relationships..The kural verse:ஊடுக மன்னோ ஒளியிழை யாமிரப்பநீடுக மன்னோ இரா. ,translates to :Sulk on O belle of shining jewels! Prolong O night! our delight swells!,and it's explantion is :Kural 1329 is a romantic verse that speaks about the longing and anticipation of a lover. The verse poetically describes a lover's wish for the night to extend, granting him more time to plead and implore his beloved, who pretends to be indifferent or displeased with him.\n\nThe \"bright-jewelled one\" refers to the beloved, adorned with shining ornaments, symbolizing her beauty and allure. Her feigned dislike is a common motif in traditional Tamil romantic literature, adding a sense of playful tension and desire to the narrative.\n\nThe lover's plea for the night to prolong signifies his yearning for more time to win over his beloved's affection, to convince her of his love, and to enjoy the sweet pain of longing. It indicates his readiness to endure the hardship of imploring in return for the joy of love.\n\nThe verse beautifully encapsulates the bittersweet nature of love - the pain of separation, the tension of unrequited feelings, and yet, the deep desire for these moments to stretch, as they hold within them the promise of love, connection, and intimacy..The kural verse:ஊடுதல் காமத்திற்கு இன்பம் அதற்கின்பம்கூடி முயங்கப் பெறின். ,translates to :Bouderie is lovers' delight Its delight grows when they unite,and it's explantion is :Kural 1330 discusses the dynamics of love and the role of temporary separation, referred to as 'Oodal' in the Tamil language. This verse highlights the concept that a temporary estrangement or disagreement between lovers can actually enhance the joy of love when they reconcile. \n\nThe first line, \"Oodal for love is pleasure\", illustrates that a small disagreement or a brief period of separation in a loving relationship can actually intensify the affection between the partners. This may seem paradoxical, but it is through the experience of absence that one often realizes the depth of their love and the importance of the other person in their life.\n\nThe second line, \"that pleasure increases when they embrace after the separation\", further deepens this understanding. The joy of reconciliation, the act of coming together after a disagreement or separation, not only resolves the conflict but also enhances the pleasure of love. It is like the pleasure of quenching one's thirst after a period of longing. The pain of separation makes the joy of unification even more delightful.\n\nThis Kural, therefore, emphasizes the value of 'Oodal' in love. It encourages understanding, patience, and reconciliation in a loving relationship, underlining that sometimes, a brief period of estrangement can strengthen the bond rather than weaken it. However, it also subtly hints that any such separation should be temporary and not prolonged, as the ultimate joy lies in the lovers' reunion and embrace.."
